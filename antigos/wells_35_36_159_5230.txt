"32",35," Introduction"
"33",35,""
"34",35,""
"35",35,"The Time Traveller (for so it will be convenient to speak of him) was"
"36",35,"expounding a recondite matter to us. His pale grey eyes shone and"
"37",35,"twinkled, and his usually pale face was flushed and animated. The fire"
"38",35,"burnt brightly, and the soft radiance of the incandescent lights in the"
"39",35,"lilies of silver caught the bubbles that flashed and passed in our"
"40",35,"glasses. Our chairs, being his patents, embraced and caressed us rather"
"41",35,"than submitted to be sat upon, and there was that luxurious"
"42",35,"after-dinner atmosphere, when thought runs gracefully free of the"
"43",35,"trammels of precision. And he put it to us in this way—marking the"
"44",35,"points with a lean forefinger—as we sat and lazily admired his"
"45",35,"earnestness over this new paradox (as we thought it) and his fecundity."
"46",35,""
"47",35,"“You must follow me carefully. I shall have to controvert one or two"
"48",35,"ideas that are almost universally accepted. The geometry, for instance,"
"49",35,"they taught you at school is founded on a misconception.”"
"50",35,""
"51",35,"“Is not that rather a large thing to expect us to begin upon?” said"
"52",35,"Filby, an argumentative person with red hair."
"53",35,""
"54",35,"“I do not mean to ask you to accept anything without reasonable ground"
"55",35,"for it. You will soon admit as much as I need from you. You know of"
"56",35,"course that a mathematical line, a line of thickness _nil_, has no real"
"57",35,"existence. They taught you that? Neither has a mathematical plane."
"58",35,"These things are mere abstractions.”"
"59",35,""
"60",35,"“That is all right,” said the Psychologist."
"61",35,""
"62",35,"“Nor, having only length, breadth, and thickness, can a cube have a"
"63",35,"real existence.”"
"64",35,""
"65",35,"“There I object,” said Filby. “Of course a solid body may exist. All"
"66",35,"real things—”"
"67",35,""
"68",35,"“So most people think. But wait a moment. Can an _instantaneous_ cube"
"69",35,"exist?”"
"70",35,""
"71",35,"“Don’t follow you,” said Filby."
"72",35,""
"73",35,"“Can a cube that does not last for any time at all, have a real"
"74",35,"existence?”"
"75",35,""
"76",35,"Filby became pensive. “Clearly,” the Time Traveller proceeded, “any"
"77",35,"real body must have extension in _four_ directions: it must have"
"78",35,"Length, Breadth, Thickness, and—Duration. But through a natural"
"79",35,"infirmity of the flesh, which I will explain to you in a moment, we"
"80",35,"incline to overlook this fact. There are really four dimensions, three"
"81",35,"which we call the three planes of Space, and a fourth, Time. There is,"
"82",35,"however, a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between the former"
"83",35,"three dimensions and the latter, because it happens that our"
"84",35,"consciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the latter"
"85",35,"from the beginning to the end of our lives.”"
"86",35,""
"87",35,"“That,” said a very young man, making spasmodic efforts to relight his"
"88",35,"cigar over the lamp; “that . . . very clear indeed.”"
"89",35,""
"90",35,"“Now, it is very remarkable that this is so extensively overlooked,”"
"91",35,"continued the Time Traveller, with a slight accession of cheerfulness."
"92",35,"“Really this is what is meant by the Fourth Dimension, though some"
"93",35,"people who talk about the Fourth Dimension do not know they mean it. It"
"94",35,"is only another way of looking at Time. _There is no difference between"
"95",35,"Time and any of the three dimensions of Space except that our"
"96",35,"consciousness moves along it_. But some foolish people have got hold of"
"97",35,"the wrong side of that idea. You have all heard what they have to say"
"98",35,"about this Fourth Dimension?”"
"99",35,""
"100",35,"“_I_ have not,” said the Provincial Mayor."
"101",35,""
"102",35,"“It is simply this. That Space, as our mathematicians have it, is"
"103",35,"spoken of as having three dimensions, which one may call Length,"
"104",35,"Breadth, and Thickness, and is always definable by reference to three"
"105",35,"planes, each at right angles to the others. But some philosophical"
"106",35,"people have been asking why _three_ dimensions particularly—why not"
"107",35,"another direction at right angles to the other three?—and have even"
"108",35,"tried to construct a Four-Dimensional geometry. Professor Simon Newcomb"
"109",35,"was expounding this to the New York Mathematical Society only a month"
"110",35,"or so ago. You know how on a flat surface, which has only two"
"111",35,"dimensions, we can represent a figure of a three-dimensional solid, and"
"112",35,"similarly they think that by models of three dimensions they could"
"113",35,"represent one of four—if they could master the perspective of the"
"114",35,"thing. See?”"
"115",35,""
"116",35,"“I think so,” murmured the Provincial Mayor; and, knitting his brows,"
"117",35,"he lapsed into an introspective state, his lips moving as one who"
"118",35,"repeats mystic words. “Yes, I think I see it now,” he said after some"
"119",35,"time, brightening in a quite transitory manner."
"120",35,""
"121",35,"“Well, I do not mind telling you I have been at work upon this geometry"
"122",35,"of Four Dimensions for some time. Some of my results are curious. For"
"123",35,"instance, here is a portrait of a man at eight years old, another at"
"124",35,"fifteen, another at seventeen, another at twenty-three, and so on. All"
"125",35,"these are evidently sections, as it were, Three-Dimensional"
"126",35,"representations of his Four-Dimensioned being, which is a fixed and"
"127",35,"unalterable thing."
"128",35,""
"129",35,"“Scientific people,” proceeded the Time Traveller, after the pause"
"130",35,"required for the proper assimilation of this, “know very well that Time"
"131",35,"is only a kind of Space. Here is a popular scientific diagram, a"
"132",35,"weather record. This line I trace with my finger shows the movement of"
"133",35,"the barometer. Yesterday it was so high, yesterday night it fell, then"
"134",35,"this morning it rose again, and so gently upward to here. Surely the"
"135",35,"mercury did not trace this line in any of the dimensions of Space"
"136",35,"generally recognised? But certainly it traced such a line, and that"
"137",35,"line, therefore, we must conclude, was along the Time-Dimension.”"
"138",35,""
"139",35,"“But,” said the Medical Man, staring hard at a coal in the fire, “if"
"140",35,"Time is really only a fourth dimension of Space, why is it, and why has"
"141",35,"it always been, regarded as something different? And why cannot we move"
"142",35,"in Time as we move about in the other dimensions of Space?”"
"143",35,""
"144",35,"The Time Traveller smiled. “Are you so sure we can move freely in"
"145",35,"Space? Right and left we can go, backward and forward freely enough,"
"146",35,"and men always have done so. I admit we move freely in two dimensions."
"147",35,"But how about up and down? Gravitation limits us there.”"
"148",35,""
"149",35,"“Not exactly,” said the Medical Man. “There are balloons.”"
"150",35,""
"151",35,"“But before the balloons, save for spasmodic jumping and the"
"152",35,"inequalities of the surface, man had no freedom of vertical movement.”"
"153",35,""
"154",35,"“Still they could move a little up and down,” said the Medical Man."
"155",35,""
"156",35,"“Easier, far easier down than up.”"
"157",35,""
"158",35,"“And you cannot move at all in Time, you cannot get away from the"
"159",35,"present moment.”"
"160",35,""
"161",35,"“My dear sir, that is just where you are wrong. That is just where the"
"162",35,"whole world has gone wrong. We are always getting away from the present"
"163",35,"moment. Our mental existences, which are immaterial and have no"
"164",35,"dimensions, are passing along the Time-Dimension with a uniform"
"165",35,"velocity from the cradle to the grave. Just as we should travel _down_"
"166",35,"if we began our existence fifty miles above the earth’s surface.”"
"167",35,""
"168",35,"“But the great difficulty is this,” interrupted the Psychologist. ’You"
"169",35,"_can_ move about in all directions of Space, but you cannot move about"
"170",35,"in Time.”"
"171",35,""
"172",35,"“That is the germ of my great discovery. But you are wrong to say that"
"173",35,"we cannot move about in Time. For instance, if I am recalling an"
"174",35,"incident very vividly I go back to the instant of its occurrence: I"
"175",35,"become absent-minded, as you say. I jump back for a moment. Of course"
"176",35,"we have no means of staying back for any length of Time, any more than"
"177",35,"a savage or an animal has of staying six feet above the ground. But a"
"178",35,"civilised man is better off than the savage in this respect. He can go"
"179",35,"up against gravitation in a balloon, and why should he not hope that"
"180",35,"ultimately he may be able to stop or accelerate his drift along the"
"181",35,"Time-Dimension, or even turn about and travel the other way?”"
"182",35,""
"183",35,"“Oh, _this_,” began Filby, “is all—”"
"184",35,""
"185",35,"“Why not?” said the Time Traveller."
"186",35,""
"187",35,"“It’s against reason,” said Filby."
"188",35,""
"189",35,"“What reason?” said the Time Traveller."
"190",35,""
"191",35,"“You can show black is white by argument,” said Filby, “but you will"
"192",35,"never convince me.”"
"193",35,""
"194",35,"“Possibly not,” said the Time Traveller. “But now you begin to see the"
"195",35,"object of my investigations into the geometry of Four Dimensions. Long"
"196",35,"ago I had a vague inkling of a machine—”"
"197",35,""
"198",35,"“To travel through Time!” exclaimed the Very Young Man."
"199",35,""
"200",35,"“That shall travel indifferently in any direction of Space and Time, as"
"201",35,"the driver determines.”"
"202",35,""
"203",35,"Filby contented himself with laughter."
"204",35,""
"205",35,"“But I have experimental verification,” said the Time Traveller."
"206",35,""
"207",35,"“It would be remarkably convenient for the historian,” the Psychologist"
"208",35,"suggested. “One might travel back and verify the accepted account of"
"209",35,"the Battle of Hastings, for instance!”"
"210",35,""
"211",35,"“Don’t you think you would attract attention?” said the Medical Man."
"212",35,"“Our ancestors had no great tolerance for anachronisms.”"
"213",35,""
"214",35,"“One might get one’s Greek from the very lips of Homer and Plato,” the"
"215",35,"Very Young Man thought."
"216",35,""
"217",35,"“In which case they would certainly plough you for the Little-go. The"
"218",35,"German scholars have improved Greek so much.”"
"219",35,""
"220",35,"“Then there is the future,” said the Very Young Man. “Just think! One"
"221",35,"might invest all one’s money, leave it to accumulate at interest, and"
"222",35,"hurry on ahead!”"
"223",35,""
"224",35,"“To discover a society,” said I, “erected on a strictly communistic"
"225",35,"basis.”"
"226",35,""
"227",35,"“Of all the wild extravagant theories!” began the Psychologist."
"228",35,""
"229",35,"“Yes, so it seemed to me, and so I never talked of it until—”"
"230",35,""
"231",35,"“Experimental verification!” cried I. “You are going to verify _that_?”"
"232",35,""
"233",35,"“The experiment!” cried Filby, who was getting brain-weary."
"234",35,""
"235",35,"“Let’s see your experiment anyhow,” said the Psychologist, “though it’s"
"236",35,"all humbug, you know.”"
"237",35,""
"238",35,"The Time Traveller smiled round at us. Then, still smiling faintly, and"
"239",35,"with his hands deep in his trousers pockets, he walked slowly out of"
"240",35,"the room, and we heard his slippers shuffling down the long passage to"
"241",35,"his laboratory."
"242",35,""
"243",35,"The Psychologist looked at us. “I wonder what he’s got?”"
"244",35,""
"245",35,"“Some sleight-of-hand trick or other,” said the Medical Man, and Filby"
"246",35,"tried to tell us about a conjuror he had seen at Burslem, but before he"
"247",35,"had finished his preface the Time Traveller came back, and Filby’s"
"248",35,"anecdote collapsed."
"249",35,""
"250",35,""
"251",35,""
"252",35,""
"253",35," II."
"254",35," The Machine"
"255",35,""
"256",35,""
"257",35,"The thing the Time Traveller held in his hand was a glittering metallic"
"258",35,"framework, scarcely larger than a small clock, and very delicately"
"259",35,"made. There was ivory in it, and some transparent crystalline"
"260",35,"substance. And now I must be explicit, for this that follows—unless his"
"261",35,"explanation is to be accepted—is an absolutely unaccountable thing. He"
"262",35,"took one of the small octagonal tables that were scattered about the"
"263",35,"room, and set it in front of the fire, with two legs on the hearthrug."
"264",35,"On this table he placed the mechanism. Then he drew up a chair, and sat"
"265",35,"down. The only other object on the table was a small shaded lamp, the"
"266",35,"bright light of which fell upon the model. There were also perhaps a"
"267",35,"dozen candles about, two in brass candlesticks upon the mantel and"
"268",35,"several in sconces, so that the room was brilliantly illuminated. I sat"
"269",35,"in a low arm-chair nearest the fire, and I drew this forward so as to"
"270",35,"be almost between the Time Traveller and the fireplace. Filby sat"
"271",35,"behind him, looking over his shoulder. The Medical Man and the"
"272",35,"Provincial Mayor watched him in profile from the right, the"
"273",35,"Psychologist from the left. The Very Young Man stood behind the"
"274",35,"Psychologist. We were all on the alert. It appears incredible to me"
"275",35,"that any kind of trick, however subtly conceived and however adroitly"
"276",35,"done, could have been played upon us under these conditions."
"277",35,""
"278",35,"The Time Traveller looked at us, and then at the mechanism. “Well?”"
"279",35,"said the Psychologist."
"280",35,""
"281",35,"“This little affair,” said the Time Traveller, resting his elbows upon"
"282",35,"the table and pressing his hands together above the apparatus, “is only"
"283",35,"a model. It is my plan for a machine to travel through time. You will"
"284",35,"notice that it looks singularly askew, and that there is an odd"
"285",35,"twinkling appearance about this bar, as though it was in some way"
"286",35,"unreal.” He pointed to the part with his finger. “Also, here is one"
"287",35,"little white lever, and here is another.”"
"288",35,""
"289",35,"The Medical Man got up out of his chair and peered into the thing."
"290",35,"“It’s beautifully made,” he said."
"291",35,""
"292",35,"“It took two years to make,” retorted the Time Traveller. Then, when we"
"293",35,"had all imitated the action of the Medical Man, he said: “Now I want"
"294",35,"you clearly to understand that this lever, being pressed over, sends"
"295",35,"the machine gliding into the future, and this other reverses the"
"296",35,"motion. This saddle represents the seat of a time traveller. Presently"
"297",35,"I am going to press the lever, and off the machine will go. It will"
"298",35,"vanish, pass into future Time, and disappear. Have a good look at the"
"299",35,"thing. Look at the table too, and satisfy yourselves there is no"
"300",35,"trickery. I don’t want to waste this model, and then be told I’m a"
"301",35,"quack.”"
"302",35,""
"303",35,"There was a minute’s pause perhaps. The Psychologist seemed about to"
"304",35,"speak to me, but changed his mind. Then the Time Traveller put forth"
"305",35,"his finger towards the lever. “No,” he said suddenly. “Lend me your"
"306",35,"hand.” And turning to the Psychologist, he took that individual’s hand"
"307",35,"in his own and told him to put out his forefinger. So that it was the"
"308",35,"Psychologist himself who sent forth the model Time Machine on its"
"309",35,"interminable voyage. We all saw the lever turn. I am absolutely certain"
"310",35,"there was no trickery. There was a breath of wind, and the lamp flame"
"311",35,"jumped. One of the candles on the mantel was blown out, and the little"
"312",35,"machine suddenly swung round, became indistinct, was seen as a ghost"
"313",35,"for a second perhaps, as an eddy of faintly glittering brass and ivory;"
"314",35,"and it was gone—vanished! Save for the lamp the table was bare."
"315",35,""
"316",35,"Everyone was silent for a minute. Then Filby said he was damned."
"317",35,""
"318",35,"The Psychologist recovered from his stupor, and suddenly looked under"
"319",35,"the table. At that the Time Traveller laughed cheerfully. “Well?” he"
"320",35,"said, with a reminiscence of the Psychologist. Then, getting up, he"
"321",35,"went to the tobacco jar on the mantel, and with his back to us began to"
"322",35,"fill his pipe."
"323",35,""
"324",35,"We stared at each other. “Look here,” said the Medical Man, “are you in"
"325",35,"earnest about this? Do you seriously believe that that machine has"
"326",35,"travelled into time?”"
"327",35,""
"328",35,"“Certainly,” said the Time Traveller, stooping to light a spill at the"
"329",35,"fire. Then he turned, lighting his pipe, to look at the Psychologist’s"
"330",35,"face. (The Psychologist, to show that he was not unhinged, helped"
"331",35,"himself to a cigar and tried to light it uncut.) “What is more, I have"
"332",35,"a big machine nearly finished in there”—he indicated the"
"333",35,"laboratory—“and when that is put together I mean to have a journey on"
"334",35,"my own account.”"
"335",35,""
"336",35,"“You mean to say that that machine has travelled into the future?” said"
"337",35,"Filby."
"338",35,""
"339",35,"“Into the future or the past—I don’t, for certain, know which.”"
"340",35,""
"341",35,"After an interval the Psychologist had an inspiration. “It must have"
"342",35,"gone into the past if it has gone anywhere,” he said."
"343",35,""
"344",35,"“Why?” said the Time Traveller."
"345",35,""
"346",35,"“Because I presume that it has not moved in space, and if it travelled"
"347",35,"into the future it would still be here all this time, since it must"
"348",35,"have travelled through this time.”"
"349",35,""
"350",35,"“But,” said I, “If it travelled into the past it would have been"
"351",35,"visible when we came first into this room; and last Thursday when we"
"352",35,"were here; and the Thursday before that; and so forth!”"
"353",35,""
"354",35,"“Serious objections,” remarked the Provincial Mayor, with an air of"
"355",35,"impartiality, turning towards the Time Traveller."
"356",35,""
"357",35,"“Not a bit,” said the Time Traveller, and, to the Psychologist: “You"
"358",35,"think. _You_ can explain that. It’s presentation below the threshold,"
"359",35,"you know, diluted presentation.”"
"360",35,""
"361",35,"“Of course,” said the Psychologist, and reassured us. “That’s a simple"
"362",35,"point of psychology. I should have thought of it. It’s plain enough,"
"363",35,"and helps the paradox delightfully. We cannot see it, nor can we"
"364",35,"appreciate this machine, any more than we can the spoke of a wheel"
"365",35,"spinning, or a bullet flying through the air. If it is travelling"
"366",35,"through time fifty times or a hundred times faster than we are, if it"
"367",35,"gets through a minute while we get through a second, the impression it"
"368",35,"creates will of course be only one-fiftieth or one-hundredth of what it"
"369",35,"would make if it were not travelling in time. That’s plain enough.” He"
"370",35,"passed his hand through the space in which the machine had been. “You"
"371",35,"see?” he said, laughing."
"372",35,""
"373",35,"We sat and stared at the vacant table for a minute or so. Then the Time"
"374",35,"Traveller asked us what we thought of it all."
"375",35,""
"376",35,"“It sounds plausible enough tonight,” said the Medical Man; “but wait"
"377",35,"until tomorrow. Wait for the common sense of the morning.”"
"378",35,""
"379",35,"“Would you like to see the Time Machine itself?” asked the Time"
"380",35,"Traveller. And therewith, taking the lamp in his hand, he led the way"
"381",35,"down the long, draughty corridor to his laboratory. I remember vividly"
"382",35,"the flickering light, his queer, broad head in silhouette, the dance of"
"383",35,"the shadows, how we all followed him, puzzled but incredulous, and how"
"384",35,"there in the laboratory we beheld a larger edition of the little"
"385",35,"mechanism which we had seen vanish from before our eyes. Parts were of"
"386",35,"nickel, parts of ivory, parts had certainly been filed or sawn out of"
"387",35,"rock crystal. The thing was generally complete, but the twisted"
"388",35,"crystalline bars lay unfinished upon the bench beside some sheets of"
"389",35,"drawings, and I took one up for a better look at it. Quartz it seemed"
"390",35,"to be."
"391",35,""
"392",35,"“Look here,” said the Medical Man, “are you perfectly serious? Or is"
"393",35,"this a trick—like that ghost you showed us last Christmas?”"
"394",35,""
"395",35,"“Upon that machine,” said the Time Traveller, holding the lamp aloft,"
"396",35,"“I intend to explore time. Is that plain? I was never more serious in"
"397",35,"my life.”"
"398",35,""
"399",35,"None of us quite knew how to take it."
"400",35,""

"410",35,""
"411",35,"I think that at that time none of us quite believed in the Time"
"412",35,"Machine. The fact is, the Time Traveller was one of those men who are"
"413",35,"too clever to be believed: you never felt that you saw all round him;"
"414",35,"you always suspected some subtle reserve, some ingenuity in ambush,"
"415",35,"behind his lucid frankness. Had Filby shown the model and explained the"
"416",35,"matter in the Time Traveller’s words, we should have shown _him_ far"
"417",35,"less scepticism. For we should have perceived his motives: a"
"418",35,"pork-butcher could understand Filby. But the Time Traveller had more"
"419",35,"than a touch of whim among his elements, and we distrusted him. Things"
"420",35,"that would have made the fame of a less clever man seemed tricks in his"
"421",35,"hands. It is a mistake to do things too easily. The serious people who"
"422",35,"took him seriously never felt quite sure of his deportment; they were"
"423",35,"somehow aware that trusting their reputations for judgment with him was"
"424",35,"like furnishing a nursery with eggshell china. So I don’t think any of"
"425",35,"us said very much about time travelling in the interval between that"
"426",35,"Thursday and the next, though its odd potentialities ran, no doubt, in"
"427",35,"most of our minds: its plausibility, that is, its practical"
"428",35,"incredibleness, the curious possibilities of anachronism and of utter"
"429",35,"confusion it suggested. For my own part, I was particularly preoccupied"
"430",35,"with the trick of the model. That I remember discussing with the"
"431",35,"Medical Man, whom I met on Friday at the Linnæan. He said he had seen a"
"432",35,"similar thing at Tübingen, and laid considerable stress on the"
"433",35,"blowing-out of the candle. But how the trick was done he could not"
"434",35,"explain."
"435",35,""
"436",35,"The next Thursday I went again to Richmond—I suppose I was one of the"
"437",35,"Time Traveller’s most constant guests—and, arriving late, found four or"
"438",35,"five men already assembled in his drawing-room. The Medical Man was"
"439",35,"standing before the fire with a sheet of paper in one hand and his"
"440",35,"watch in the other. I looked round for the Time Traveller, and—“It’s"
"441",35,"half-past seven now,” said the Medical Man. “I suppose we’d better have"
"442",35,"dinner?”"
"443",35,""
"444",35,"“Where’s——?” said I, naming our host."
"445",35,""
"446",35,"“You’ve just come? It’s rather odd. He’s unavoidably detained. He asks"
"447",35,"me in this note to lead off with dinner at seven if he’s not back. Says"
"448",35,"he’ll explain when he comes.”"
"449",35,""
"450",35,"“It seems a pity to let the dinner spoil,” said the Editor of a"
"451",35,"well-known daily paper; and thereupon the Doctor rang the bell."
"452",35,""
"453",35,"The Psychologist was the only person besides the Doctor and myself who"
"454",35,"had attended the previous dinner. The other men were Blank, the Editor"
"455",35,"aforementioned, a certain journalist, and another—a quiet, shy man with"
"456",35,"a beard—whom I didn’t know, and who, as far as my observation went,"
"457",35,"never opened his mouth all the evening. There was some speculation at"
"458",35,"the dinner-table about the Time Traveller’s absence, and I suggested"
"459",35,"time travelling, in a half-jocular spirit. The Editor wanted that"
"460",35,"explained to him, and the Psychologist volunteered a wooden account of"
"461",35,"the “ingenious paradox and trick” we had witnessed that day week. He"
"462",35,"was in the midst of his exposition when the door from the corridor"
"463",35,"opened slowly and without noise. I was facing the door, and saw it"
"464",35,"first. “Hallo!” I said. “At last!” And the door opened wider, and the"
"465",35,"Time Traveller stood before us. I gave a cry of surprise. “Good"
"466",35,"heavens! man, what’s the matter?” cried the Medical Man, who saw him"
"467",35,"next. And the whole tableful turned towards the door."
"468",35,""
"469",35,"He was in an amazing plight. His coat was dusty and dirty, and smeared"
"470",35,"with green down the sleeves; his hair disordered, and as it seemed to"
"471",35,"me greyer—either with dust and dirt or because its colour had actually"
"472",35,"faded. His face was ghastly pale; his chin had a brown cut on it—a cut"
"473",35,"half-healed; his expression was haggard and drawn, as by intense"
"474",35,"suffering. For a moment he hesitated in the doorway, as if he had been"
"475",35,"dazzled by the light. Then he came into the room. He walked with just"
"476",35,"such a limp as I have seen in footsore tramps. We stared at him in"
"477",35,"silence, expecting him to speak."
"478",35,""
"479",35,"He said not a word, but came painfully to the table, and made a motion"
"480",35,"towards the wine. The Editor filled a glass of champagne, and pushed it"
"481",35,"towards him. He drained it, and it seemed to do him good: for he looked"
"482",35,"round the table, and the ghost of his old smile flickered across his"
"483",35,"face. “What on earth have you been up to, man?” said the Doctor. The"
"484",35,"Time Traveller did not seem to hear. “Don’t let me disturb you,” he"
"485",35,"said, with a certain faltering articulation. “I’m all right.” He"
"486",35,"stopped, held out his glass for more, and took it off at a draught."
"487",35,"“That’s good,” he said. His eyes grew brighter, and a faint colour came"
"488",35,"into his cheeks. His glance flickered over our faces with a certain"
"489",35,"dull approval, and then went round the warm and comfortable room. Then"
"490",35,"he spoke again, still as it were feeling his way among his words. “I’m"
"491",35,"going to wash and dress, and then I’ll come down and explain things...."
"492",35,"Save me some of that mutton. I’m starving for a bit of meat.”"
"493",35,""
"494",35,"He looked across at the Editor, who was a rare visitor, and hoped he"
"495",35,"was all right. The Editor began a question. “Tell you presently,” said"
"496",35,"the Time Traveller. “I’m—funny! Be all right in a minute.”"
"497",35,""
"498",35,"He put down his glass, and walked towards the staircase door. Again I"
"499",35,"remarked his lameness and the soft padding sound of his footfall, and"
"500",35,"standing up in my place, I saw his feet as he went out. He had nothing"
"501",35,"on them but a pair of tattered, blood-stained socks. Then the door"
"502",35,"closed upon him. I had half a mind to follow, till I remembered how he"
"503",35,"detested any fuss about himself. For a minute, perhaps, my mind was"
"504",35,"wool-gathering. Then, “Remarkable Behaviour of an Eminent Scientist,” I"
"505",35,"heard the Editor say, thinking (after his wont) in headlines. And this"
"506",35,"brought my attention back to the bright dinner-table."
"507",35,""
"508",35,"“What’s the game?” said the Journalist. “Has he been doing the Amateur"
"509",35,"Cadger? I don’t follow.” I met the eye of the Psychologist, and read my"
"510",35,"own interpretation in his face. I thought of the Time Traveller limping"
"511",35,"painfully upstairs. I don’t think anyone else had noticed his lameness."
"512",35,""
"513",35,"The first to recover completely from this surprise was the Medical Man,"
"514",35,"who rang the bell—the Time Traveller hated to have servants waiting at"
"515",35,"dinner—for a hot plate. At that the Editor turned to his knife and fork"
"516",35,"with a grunt, and the Silent Man followed suit. The dinner was resumed."
"517",35,"Conversation was exclamatory for a little while with gaps of"
"518",35,"wonderment; and then the Editor got fervent in his curiosity. “Does our"
"519",35,"friend eke out his modest income with a crossing? or has he his"
"520",35,"Nebuchadnezzar phases?” he inquired. “I feel assured it’s this business"
"521",35,"of the Time Machine,” I said, and took up the Psychologist’s account of"
"522",35,"our previous meeting. The new guests were frankly incredulous. The"
"523",35,"Editor raised objections. “What _was_ this time travelling? A man"
"524",35,"couldn’t cover himself with dust by rolling in a paradox, could he?”"
"525",35,"And then, as the idea came home to him, he resorted to caricature."
"526",35,"Hadn’t they any clothes-brushes in the Future? The Journalist too,"
"527",35,"would not believe at any price, and joined the Editor in the easy work"
"528",35,"of heaping ridicule on the whole thing. They were both the new kind of"
"529",35,"journalist—very joyous, irreverent young men. “Our Special"
"530",35,"Correspondent in the Day after Tomorrow reports,” the Journalist was"
"531",35,"saying—or rather shouting—when the Time Traveller came back. He was"
"532",35,"dressed in ordinary evening clothes, and nothing save his haggard look"
"533",35,"remained of the change that had startled me."
"534",35,""
"535",35,"“I say,” said the Editor hilariously, “these chaps here say you have"
"536",35,"been travelling into the middle of next week! Tell us all about little"
"537",35,"Rosebery, will you? What will you take for the lot?”"
"538",35,""
"539",35,"The Time Traveller came to the place reserved for him without a word."
"540",35,"He smiled quietly, in his old way. “Where’s my mutton?” he said. “What"
"541",35,"a treat it is to stick a fork into meat again!”"
"542",35,""
"543",35,"“Story!” cried the Editor."
"544",35,""
"545",35,"“Story be damned!” said the Time Traveller. “I want something to eat. I"
"546",35,"won’t say a word until I get some peptone into my arteries. Thanks. And"
"547",35,"the salt.”"
"548",35,""
"549",35,"“One word,” said I. “Have you been time travelling?”"
"550",35,""
"551",35,"“Yes,” said the Time Traveller, with his mouth full, nodding his head."
"552",35,""
"553",35,"“I’d give a shilling a line for a verbatim note,” said the Editor. The"
"554",35,"Time Traveller pushed his glass towards the Silent Man and rang it with"
"555",35,"his fingernail; at which the Silent Man, who had been staring at his"
"556",35,"face, started convulsively, and poured him wine. The rest of the dinner"
"557",35,"was uncomfortable. For my own part, sudden questions kept on rising to"
"558",35,"my lips, and I dare say it was the same with the others. The Journalist"
"559",35,"tried to relieve the tension by telling anecdotes of Hettie Potter. The"
"560",35,"Time Traveller devoted his attention to his dinner, and displayed the"
"561",35,"appetite of a tramp. The Medical Man smoked a cigarette, and watched"
"562",35,"the Time Traveller through his eyelashes. The Silent Man seemed even"
"563",35,"more clumsy than usual, and drank champagne with regularity and"
"564",35,"determination out of sheer nervousness. At last the Time Traveller"
"565",35,"pushed his plate away, and looked round us. “I suppose I must"
"566",35,"apologise,” he said. “I was simply starving. I’ve had a most amazing"
"567",35,"time.” He reached out his hand for a cigar, and cut the end. “But come"
"568",35,"into the smoking-room. It’s too long a story to tell over greasy"
"569",35,"plates.” And ringing the bell in passing, he led the way into the"
"570",35,"adjoining room."
"571",35,""
"572",35,"“You have told Blank, and Dash, and Chose about the machine?” he said"
"573",35,"to me, leaning back in his easy-chair and naming the three new guests."
"574",35,""
"575",35,"“But the thing’s a mere paradox,” said the Editor."
"576",35,""
"577",35,"“I can’t argue tonight. I don’t mind telling you the story, but I can’t"
"578",35,"argue. I will,” he went on, “tell you the story of what has happened to"
"579",35,"me, if you like, but you must refrain from interruptions. I want to"
"580",35,"tell it. Badly. Most of it will sound like lying. So be it! It’s"
"581",35,"true—every word of it, all the same. I was in my laboratory at four"
"582",35,"o’clock, and since then … I’ve lived eight days … such days as no human"
"583",35,"being ever lived before! I’m nearly worn out, but I shan’t sleep till"
"584",35,"I’ve told this thing over to you. Then I shall go to bed. But no"
"585",35,"interruptions! Is it agreed?”"
"586",35,""
"587",35,"“Agreed,” said the Editor, and the rest of us echoed “Agreed.” And with"
"588",35,"that the Time Traveller began his story as I have set it forth. He sat"
"589",35,"back in his chair at first, and spoke like a weary man. Afterwards he"
"590",35,"got more animated. In writing it down I feel with only too much"
"591",35,"keenness the inadequacy of pen and ink—and, above all, my own"
"592",35,"inadequacy—to express its quality. You read, I will suppose,"
"593",35,"attentively enough; but you cannot see the speaker’s white, sincere"
"594",35,"face in the bright circle of the little lamp, nor hear the intonation"
"595",35,"of his voice. You cannot know how his expression followed the turns of"
"596",35,"his story! Most of us hearers were in shadow, for the candles in the"
"597",35,"smoking-room had not been lighted, and only the face of the Journalist"
"598",35,"and the legs of the Silent Man from the knees downward were"
"599",35,"illuminated. At first we glanced now and again at each other. After a"
"600",35,"time we ceased to do that, and looked only at the Time Traveller’s"

"610",35,"“I told some of you last Thursday of the principles of the Time"
"611",35,"Machine, and showed you the actual thing itself, incomplete in the"
"612",35,"workshop. There it is now, a little travel-worn, truly; and one of the"
"613",35,"ivory bars is cracked, and a brass rail bent; but the rest of it’s"
"614",35,"sound enough. I expected to finish it on Friday; but on Friday, when"
"615",35,"the putting together was nearly done, I found that one of the nickel"
"616",35,"bars was exactly one inch too short, and this I had to get remade; so"
"617",35,"that the thing was not complete until this morning. It was at ten"
"618",35,"o’clock today that the first of all Time Machines began its career. I"
"619",35,"gave it a last tap, tried all the screws again, put one more drop of"
"620",35,"oil on the quartz rod, and sat myself in the saddle. I suppose a"
"621",35,"suicide who holds a pistol to his skull feels much the same wonder at"
"622",35,"what will come next as I felt then. I took the starting lever in one"
"623",35,"hand and the stopping one in the other, pressed the first, and almost"
"624",35,"immediately the second. I seemed to reel; I felt a nightmare sensation"
"625",35,"of falling; and, looking round, I saw the laboratory exactly as before."
"626",35,"Had anything happened? For a moment I suspected that my intellect had"
"627",35,"tricked me. Then I noted the clock. A moment before, as it seemed, it"
"628",35,"had stood at a minute or so past ten; now it was nearly half-past"
"629",35,"three!"
"630",35,""
"631",35,"“I drew a breath, set my teeth, gripped the starting lever with both"
"632",35,"hands, and went off with a thud. The laboratory got hazy and went dark."
"633",35,"Mrs. Watchett came in and walked, apparently without seeing me, towards"
"634",35,"the garden door. I suppose it took her a minute or so to traverse the"
"635",35,"place, but to me she seemed to shoot across the room like a rocket. I"
"636",35,"pressed the lever over to its extreme position. The night came like the"
"637",35,"turning out of a lamp, and in another moment came tomorrow. The"
"638",35,"laboratory grew faint and hazy, then fainter and ever fainter. Tomorrow"
"639",35,"night came black, then day again, night again, day again, faster and"
"640",35,"faster still. An eddying murmur filled my ears, and a strange, dumb"
"641",35,"confusedness descended on my mind."
"642",35,""
"643",35,"“I am afraid I cannot convey the peculiar sensations of time"
"644",35,"travelling. They are excessively unpleasant. There is a feeling exactly"
"645",35,"like that one has upon a switchback—of a helpless headlong motion! I"
"646",35,"felt the same horrible anticipation, too, of an imminent smash. As I"
"647",35,"put on pace, night followed day like the flapping of a black wing. The"
"648",35,"dim suggestion of the laboratory seemed presently to fall away from me,"
"649",35,"and I saw the sun hopping swiftly across the sky, leaping it every"
"650",35,"minute, and every minute marking a day. I supposed the laboratory had"
"651",35,"been destroyed and I had come into the open air. I had a dim impression"
"652",35,"of scaffolding, but I was already going too fast to be conscious of any"
"653",35,"moving things. The slowest snail that ever crawled dashed by too fast"
"654",35,"for me. The twinkling succession of darkness and light was excessively"
"655",35,"painful to the eye. Then, in the intermittent darknesses, I saw the"
"656",35,"moon spinning swiftly through her quarters from new to full, and had a"
"657",35,"faint glimpse of the circling stars. Presently, as I went on, still"
"658",35,"gaining velocity, the palpitation of night and day merged into one"
"659",35,"continuous greyness; the sky took on a wonderful deepness of blue, a"
"660",35,"splendid luminous colour like that of early twilight; the jerking sun"
"661",35,"became a streak of fire, a brilliant arch, in space; the moon a fainter"
"662",35,"fluctuating band; and I could see nothing of the stars, save now and"
"663",35,"then a brighter circle flickering in the blue."

"665",35,"“The landscape was misty and vague. I was still on the hillside upon"

"668",35,"now green; they grew, spread, shivered, and passed away. I saw huge"
"669",35,"buildings rise up faint and fair, and pass like dreams. The whole"
"670",35,"surface of the earth seemed changed—melting and flowing under my eyes."
"671",35,"The little hands upon the dials that registered my speed raced round"
"672",35,"faster and faster. Presently I noted that the sun belt swayed up and"
"673",35,"down, from solstice to solstice, in a minute or less, and that"
"674",35,"consequently my pace was over a year a minute; and minute by minute the"
"675",35,"white snow flashed across the world, and vanished, and was followed by"
"676",35,"the bright, brief green of spring."
"677",35,""
"678",35,"“The unpleasant sensations of the start were less poignant now. They"
"679",35,"merged at last into a kind of hysterical exhilaration. I remarked,"
"680",35,"indeed, a clumsy swaying of the machine, for which I was unable to"
"681",35,"account. But my mind was too confused to attend to it, so with a kind"
"682",35,"of madness growing upon me, I flung myself into futurity. At first I"
"683",35,"scarce thought of stopping, scarce thought of anything but these new"
"684",35,"sensations. But presently a fresh series of impressions grew up in my"
"685",35,"mind—a certain curiosity and therewith a certain dread—until at last"
"686",35,"they took complete possession of me. What strange developments of"
"687",35,"humanity, what wonderful advances upon our rudimentary civilisation, I"
"688",35,"thought, might not appear when I came to look nearly into the dim"
"689",35,"elusive world that raced and fluctuated before my eyes! I saw great and"
"690",35,"splendid architecture rising about me, more massive than any buildings"
"691",35,"of our own time, and yet, as it seemed, built of glimmer and mist. I"
"692",35,"saw a richer green flow up the hillside, and remain there, without any"
"693",35,"wintry intermission. Even through the veil of my confusion the earth"
"694",35,"seemed very fair. And so my mind came round to the business of"
"695",35,"stopping."
"696",35,""
"697",35,"“The peculiar risk lay in the possibility of my finding some substance"
"698",35,"in the space which I, or the machine, occupied. So long as I travelled"
"699",35,"at a high velocity through time, this scarcely mattered: I was, so to"
"700",35,"speak, attenuated—was slipping like a vapour through the interstices of"
"701",35,"intervening substances! But to come to a stop involved the jamming of"
"702",35,"myself, molecule by molecule, into whatever lay in my way; meant"
"703",35,"bringing my atoms into such intimate contact with those of the obstacle"
"704",35,"that a profound chemical reaction—possibly a far-reaching"
"705",35,"explosion—would result, and blow myself and my apparatus out of all"
"706",35,"possible dimensions—into the Unknown. This possibility had occurred to"
"707",35,"me again and again while I was making the machine; but then I had"
"708",35,"cheerfully accepted it as an unavoidable risk—one of the risks a man"
"709",35,"has got to take! Now the risk was inevitable, I no longer saw it in the"
"710",35,"same cheerful light. The fact is that, insensibly, the absolute"
"711",35,"strangeness of everything, the sickly jarring and swaying of the"
"712",35,"machine, above all, the feeling of prolonged falling, had absolutely"
"713",35,"upset my nerves. I told myself that I could never stop, and with a gust"
"714",35,"of petulance I resolved to stop forthwith. Like an impatient fool, I"
"715",35,"lugged over the lever, and incontinently the thing went reeling over,"
"716",35,"and I was flung headlong through the air."
"717",35,""
"718",35,"“There was the sound of a clap of thunder in my ears. I may have been"
"719",35,"stunned for a moment. A pitiless hail was hissing round me, and I was"

"721",35,"seemed grey, but presently I remarked that the confusion in my ears was"
"722",35,"gone. I looked round me. I was on what seemed to be a little lawn in a"
"723",35,"garden, surrounded by rhododendron bushes, and I noticed that their"
"724",35,"mauve and purple blossoms were dropping in a shower under the beating"
"725",35,"of the hailstones. The rebounding, dancing hail hung in a little cloud"
"726",35,"over the machine, and drove along the ground like smoke. In a moment I"
"727",35,"was wet to the skin. ‘Fine hospitality,’ said I, ‘to a man who has"
"728",35,"travelled innumerable years to see you.’"
"729",35,""
"730",35,"“Presently I thought what a fool I was to get wet. I stood up and"

"732",35,"stone, loomed indistinctly beyond the rhododendrons through the hazy"
"733",35,"downpour. But all else of the world was invisible."
"734",35,""
"735",35,"“My sensations would be hard to describe. As the columns of hail grew"
"736",35,"thinner, I saw the white figure more distinctly. It was very large, for"
"737",35,"a silver birch-tree touched its shoulder. It was of white marble, in"
"738",35,"shape something like a winged sphinx, but the wings, instead of being"
"739",35,"carried vertically at the sides, were spread so that it seemed to"
"740",35,"hover. The pedestal, it appeared to me, was of bronze, and was thick"
"741",35,"with verdigris. It chanced that the face was towards me; the sightless"
"742",35,"eyes seemed to watch me; there was the faint shadow of a smile on the"

"1745",35,"have long since passed its zenith, and was now far fallen into decay."
"1746",35,"The too-perfect security of the Overworlders had led them to a slow"
"1747",35,"movement of degeneration, to a general dwindling in size, strength, and"
"1748",35,"intelligence. That I could see clearly enough already. What had"
"1749",35,"happened to the Undergrounders I did not yet suspect; but, from what I"
"1750",35,"had seen of the Morlocks—that, by the bye, was the name by which these"
"1751",35,"creatures were called—I could imagine that the modification of the"
"1752",35,"human type was even far more profound than among the ‘Eloi,’ the"
"1753",35,"beautiful race that I already knew."

"1757",35,"Eloi were masters, could they not restore the machine to me? And why"
"1758",35,"were they so terribly afraid of the dark? I proceeded, as I have said,"
"1759",35,"to question Weena about this Underworld, but here again I was"
"1760",35,"disappointed. At first she would not understand my questions, and"
"1761",35,"presently she refused to answer them. She shivered as though the topic"
"1762",35,"was unendurable. And when I pressed her, perhaps a little harshly, she"
"1763",35,"burst into tears. They were the only tears, except my own, I ever saw"
"1764",35,"in that Golden Age. When I saw them I ceased abruptly to trouble about"
"1765",35,"the Morlocks, and was only concerned in banishing these signs of her"
"1766",35,"human inheritance from Weena’s eyes. And very soon she was smiling and"
"1767",35,"clapping her hands, while I solemnly burnt a match."

"2071",35,"had they taken my Time Machine?"

"2073",35,"“So we went on in the quiet, and the twilight deepened into night. The"
"2074",35,"clear blue of the distance faded, and one star after another came out."
"2075",35,"The ground grew dim and the trees black. Weena’s fears and her fatigue"
"2076",35,"grew upon her. I took her in my arms and talked to her and caressed"
"2077",35,"her. Then, as the darkness grew deeper, she put her arms round my neck,"
"2078",35,"and, closing her eyes, tightly pressed her face against my shoulder. So"
"2079",35,"we went down a long slope into a valley, and there in the dimness I"
"2080",35,"almost walked into a little river. This I waded, and went up the"
"2081",35,"opposite side of the valley, past a number of sleeping houses, and by a"
"2082",35,"statue—a Faun, or some such figure, _minus_ the head. Here too were"
"2083",35,"acacias. So far I had seen nothing of the Morlocks, but it was yet"
"2084",35,"early in the night, and the darker hours before the old moon rose were"
"2085",35,"still to come."

"2087",35,"“From the brow of the next hill I saw a thick wood spreading wide and"
"2088",35,"black before me. I hesitated at this. I could see no end to it, either"
"2089",35,"to the right or the left. Feeling tired—my feet, in particular, were"
"2090",35,"very sore—I carefully lowered Weena from my shoulder as I halted, and"
"2091",35,"sat down upon the turf. I could no longer see the Palace of Green"
"2092",35,"Porcelain, and I was in doubt of my direction. I looked into the"
"2093",35,"thickness of the wood and thought of what it might hide. Under that"
"2094",35,"dense tangle of branches one would be out of sight of the stars. Even"
"2095",35,"were there no other lurking danger—a danger I did not care to let my"
"2096",35,"imagination loose upon—there would still be all the roots to stumble"
"2097",35,"over and the tree-boles to strike against. I was very tired, too, after"
"2098",35,"the excitements of the day; so I decided that I would not face it, but"
"2099",35,"would pass the night upon the open hill."

"2101",35,"“Weena, I was glad to find, was fast asleep. I carefully wrapped her in"
"2102",35,"my jacket, and sat down beside her to wait for the moonrise. The"
"2103",35,"hillside was quiet and deserted, but from the black of the wood there"
"2104",35,"came now and then a stir of living things. Above me shone the stars,"
"2105",35,"for the night was very clear. I felt a certain sense of friendly"
"2106",35,"comfort in their twinkling. All the old constellations had gone from"
"2107",35,"the sky, however: that slow movement which is imperceptible in a"
"2108",35,"hundred human lifetimes, had long since rearranged them in unfamiliar"
"2109",35,"groupings. But the Milky Way, it seemed to me, was still the same"
"2110",35,"tattered streamer of star-dust as of yore. Southward (as I judged it)"
"2111",35,"was a very bright red star that was new to me; it was even more"
"2112",35,"splendid than our own green Sirius. And amid all these scintillating"
"2113",35,"points of light one bright planet shone kindly and steadily like the"
"2114",35,"face of an old friend."

"2116",35,"“Looking at these stars suddenly dwarfed my own troubles and all the"
"2117",35,"gravities of terrestrial life. I thought of their unfathomable"
"2118",35,"distance, and the slow inevitable drift of their movements out of the"
"2119",35,"unknown past into the unknown future. I thought of the great"
"2120",35,"precessional cycle that the pole of the earth describes. Only forty"
"2121",35,"times had that silent revolution occurred during all the years that I"
"2122",35,"had traversed. And during these few revolutions all the activity, all"
"2123",35,"the traditions, the complex organisations, the nations, languages,"
"2124",35,"literatures, aspirations, even the mere memory of Man as I knew him,"
"2125",35,"had been swept out of existence. Instead were these frail creatures who"
"2126",35,"had forgotten their high ancestry, and the white Things of which I went"
"2127",35,"in terror. Then I thought of the Great Fear that was between the two"
"2128",35,"species, and for the first time, with a sudden shiver, came the clear"
"2129",35,"knowledge of what the meat I had seen might be. Yet it was too"
"2130",35,"horrible! I looked at little Weena sleeping beside me, her face white"
"2131",35,"and starlike under the stars, and forthwith dismissed the thought."

"2133",35,"“Through that long night I held my mind off the Morlocks as well as I"
"2134",35,"could, and whiled away the time by trying to fancy I could find signs"
"2135",35,"of the old constellations in the new confusion. The sky kept very"
"2136",35,"clear, except for a hazy cloud or so. No doubt I dozed at times. Then,"
"2137",35,"as my vigil wore on, came a faintness in the eastward sky, like the"
"2138",35,"reflection of some colourless fire, and the old moon rose, thin and"
"2139",35,"peaked and white. And close behind, and overtaking it, and overflowing"
"2140",35,"it, the dawn came, pale at first, and then growing pink and warm. No"
"2141",35,"Morlocks had approached us. Indeed, I had seen none upon the hill that"
"2142",35,"night. And in the confidence of renewed day it almost seemed to me that"
"2143",35,"my fear had been unreasonable. I stood up and found my foot with the"
"2144",35,"loose heel swollen at the ankle and painful under the heel; so I sat"

"2150",35,"dancing in the sunlight as though there was no such thing in nature as"
"2151",35,"the night. And then I thought once more of the meat that I had seen. I"
"2152",35,"felt assured now of what it was, and from the bottom of my heart I"
"2153",35,"pitied this last feeble rill from the great flood of humanity. Clearly,"
"2154",35,"at some time in the Long-Ago of human decay the Morlocks’ food had run"
"2155",35,"short. Possibly they had lived on rats and such-like vermin. Even now"
"2156",35,"man is far less discriminating and exclusive in his food than he"
"2157",35,"was—far less than any monkey. His prejudice against human flesh is no"
"2158",35,"deep-seated instinct. And so these inhuman sons of men——! I tried to"
"2159",35,"look at the thing in a scientific spirit. After all, they were less"
"2160",35,"human and more remote than our cannibal ancestors of three or four"
"2161",35,"thousand years ago. And the intelligence that would have made this"
"2162",35,"state of things a torment had gone. Why should I trouble myself? These"
"2163",35,"Eloi were mere fatted cattle, which the ant-like Morlocks preserved and"
"2164",35,"preyed upon—probably saw to the breeding of. And there was Weena"

"2166",35,""
"2167",35,"“Then I tried to preserve myself from the horror that was coming upon"
"2168",35,"me, by regarding it as a rigorous punishment of human selfishness. Man"
"2169",35,"had been content to live in ease and delight upon the labours of his"
"2170",35,"fellow-man, had taken Necessity as his watchword and excuse, and in the"
"2171",35,"fullness of time Necessity had come home to him. I even tried a"
"2172",35,"Carlyle-like scorn of this wretched aristocracy in decay. But this"

"2178",35,"“I had at that time very vague ideas as to the course I should pursue."

"2180",35,"such arms of metal or stone as I could contrive. That necessity was"
"2181",35,"immediate. In the next place, I hoped to procure some means of fire, so"

"2201",35,"noon, deserted and falling into ruin. Only ragged vestiges of glass"
"2202",35,"remained in its windows, and great sheets of the green facing had"
"2203",35,"fallen away from the corroded metallic framework. It lay very high upon"
"2204",35,"a turfy down, and looking north-eastward before I entered it, I was"
"2205",35,"surprised to see a large estuary, or even creek, where I judged"
"2206",35,"Wandsworth and Battersea must once have been. I thought then—though I"

"2212",35,"unknown character. I thought, rather foolishly, that Weena might help"
"2213",35,"me to interpret this, but I only learnt that the bare idea of writing"
"2214",35,"had never entered her head. She always seemed to me, I fancy, more"
"2215",35,"human than she was, perhaps because her affection was so human."
"2216",35,""
"2217",35,"“Within the big valves of the door—which were open and broken—we found,"
"2218",35,"instead of the customary hall, a long gallery lit by many side windows."
"2219",35,"At the first glance I was reminded of a museum. The tiled floor was"
"2220",35,"thick with dust, and a remarkable array of miscellaneous objects was"
"2221",35,"shrouded in the same grey covering. Then I perceived, standing strange"
"2222",35,"and gaunt in the centre of the hall, what was clearly the lower part of"
"2223",35,"a huge skeleton. I recognised by the oblique feet that it was some"
"2224",35,"extinct creature after the fashion of the Megatherium. The skull and"
"2225",35,"the upper bones lay beside it in the thick dust, and in one place,"
"2226",35,"where rain-water had dropped through a leak in the roof, the thing"
"2227",35,"itself had been worn away. Further in the gallery was the huge skeleton"
"2228",35,"barrel of a Brontosaurus. My museum hypothesis was confirmed. Going"
"2229",35,"towards the side I found what appeared to be sloping shelves, and"
"2230",35,"clearing away the thick dust, I found the old familiar glass cases of"
"2231",35,"our own time. But they must have been air-tight to judge from the fair"

"2238",35,"extinction of bacteria and fungi, lost ninety-nine hundredths of its"
"2239",35,"force, was nevertheless, with extreme sureness if with extreme slowness"
"2240",35,"at work again upon all its treasures. Here and there I found traces of"
"2241",35,"the little people in the shape of rare fossils broken to pieces or"
"2242",35,"threaded in strings upon reeds. And the cases had in some instances"
"2243",35,"been bodily removed—by the Morlocks, as I judged. The place was very"
"2244",35,"silent. The thick dust deadened our footsteps. Weena, who had been"
"2245",35,"rolling a sea urchin down the sloping glass of a case, presently came,"
"2246",35,"as I stared about me, and very quietly took my hand and stood beside"
"2247",35,"me."

"2249",35,"“And at first I was so much surprised by this ancient monument of an"
"2250",35,"intellectual age that I gave no thought to the possibilities it"

"2252",35,"little from my mind."
"2253",35,""
"2254",35,"“To judge from the size of the place, this Palace of Green Porcelain"
"2255",35,"had a great deal more in it than a Gallery of Palæontology; possibly"
"2256",35,"historical galleries; it might be, even a library! To me, at least in"
"2257",35,"my present circumstances, these would be vastly more interesting than"
"2258",35,"this spectacle of old-time geology in decay. Exploring, I found another"
"2259",35,"short gallery running transversely to the first. This appeared to be"
"2260",35,"devoted to minerals, and the sight of a block of sulphur set my mind"
"2261",35,"running on gunpowder. But I could find no saltpetre; indeed, no"
"2262",35,"nitrates of any kind. Doubtless they had deliquesced ages ago. Yet the"
"2263",35,"sulphur hung in my mind, and set up a train of thinking. As for the"
"2264",35,"rest of the contents of that gallery, though on the whole they were the"
"2265",35,"best preserved of all I saw, I had little interest. I am no specialist"
"2266",35,"in mineralogy, and I went on down a very ruinous aisle running parallel"
"2267",35,"to the first hall I had entered. Apparently this section had been"
"2268",35,"devoted to natural history, but everything had long since passed out of"
"2269",35,"recognition. A few shrivelled and blackened vestiges of what had once"
"2270",35,"been stuffed animals, desiccated mummies in jars that had once held"
"2271",35,"spirit, a brown dust of departed plants: that was all! I was sorry for"
"2272",35,"that, because I should have been glad to trace the patient"
"2273",35,"readjustments by which the conquest of animated nature had been"

"2275",35,"singularly ill-lit, the floor of it running downward at a slight angle"
"2276",35,"from the end at which I entered. At intervals white globes hung from"
"2277",35,"the ceiling—many of them cracked and smashed—which suggested that"
"2278",35,"originally the place had been artificially lit. Here I was more in my"
"2279",35,"element, for rising on either side of me were the huge bulks of big"
"2280",35,"machines, all greatly corroded and many broken down, but some still"
"2281",35,"fairly complete. You know I have a certain weakness for mechanism, and"
"2282",35,"I was inclined to linger among these; the more so as for the most part"
"2283",35,"they had the interest of puzzles, and I could make only the vaguest"
"2284",35,"guesses at what they were for. I fancied that if I could solve their"

"2289",35,"startled me. Had it not been for her I do not think I should have"
"2290",35,"noticed that the floor of the gallery sloped at all. [Footnote: It may"
"2291",35,"be, of course, that the floor did not slope, but that the museum was"
"2292",35,"built into the side of a hill.—ED.] The end I had come in at was quite"
"2293",35,"above ground, and was lit by rare slit-like windows. As you went down"
"2294",35,"the length, the ground came up against these windows, until at last"
"2295",35,"there was a pit like the ‘area‘ of a London house before each, and only"
"2296",35,"a narrow line of daylight at the top. I went slowly along, puzzling"
"2297",35,"about the machines, and had been too intent upon them to notice the"
"2298",35,"gradual diminution of the light, until Weena’s increasing apprehensions"
"2299",35,"drew my attention. Then I saw that the gallery ran down at last into a"
"2300",35,"thick darkness. I hesitated, and then, as I looked round me, I saw that"
"2301",35,"the dust was less abundant and its surface less even. Further away"
"2302",35,"towards the dimness, it appeared to be broken by a number of small"
"2303",35,"narrow footprints. My sense of the immediate presence of the Morlocks"
"2304",35,"revived at that. I felt that I was wasting my time in the academic"
"2305",35,"examination of machinery. I called to mind that it was already far"
"2306",35,"advanced in the afternoon, and that I had still no weapon, no refuge,"
"2307",35,"and no means of making a fire. And then down in the remote blackness of"

"2314",35,"hands, I put all my weight upon it sideways. Suddenly Weena, deserted"
"2315",35,"in the central aisle, began to whimper. I had judged the strength of"
"2316",35,"the lever pretty correctly, for it snapped after a minute’s strain, and"
"2317",35,"I rejoined her with a mace in my hand more than sufficient, I judged,"
"2318",35,"for any Morlock skull I might encounter. And I longed very much to kill"
"2319",35,"a Morlock or so. Very inhuman, you may think, to want to go killing"
"2320",35,"one’s own descendants! But it was impossible, somehow, to feel any"
"2321",35,"humanity in the things. Only my disinclination to leave Weena, and a"
"2322",35,"persuasion that if I began to slake my thirst for murder my Time"
"2323",35,"Machine might suffer, restrained me from going straight down the"
"2324",35,"gallery and killing the brutes I heard."
"2325",35,""
"2326",35,"“Well, mace in one hand and Weena in the other, I went out of that"
"2327",35,"gallery and into another and still larger one, which at the first"
"2328",35,"glance reminded me of a military chapel hung with tattered flags. The"
"2329",35,"brown and charred rags that hung from the sides of it, I presently"
"2330",35,"recognised as the decaying vestiges of books. They had long since"
"2331",35,"dropped to pieces, and every semblance of print had left them. But here"
"2332",35,"and there were warped boards and cracked metallic clasps that told the"
"2333",35,"tale well enough. Had I been a literary man I might, perhaps, have"
"2334",35,"moralised upon the futility of all ambition. But as it was, the thing"
"2335",35,"that struck me with keenest force was the enormous waste of labour to"
"2336",35,"which this sombre wilderness of rotting paper testified. At the time I"

"2343",35,"this gallery was well preserved. I went eagerly to every unbroken case."
"2344",35,"And at last, in one of the really air-tight cases, I found a box of"

"2350",35,"composite dance, whistling _The Land of the Leal_ as cheerfully as I"
"2351",35,"could. In part it was a modest _cancan_, in part a step dance, in part"

"2358",35,"substance, and that was camphor. I found it in a sealed jar, that by"
"2359",35,"chance, I suppose, had been really hermetically sealed. I fancied at"
"2360",35,"first that it was paraffin wax, and smashed the glass accordingly. But"
"2361",35,"the odour of camphor was unmistakable. In the universal decay this"

"2527",35,"dry sticks, and could economise my camphor. Then I turned to where"

"2539",35,"the match-box, and—it had gone! Then they gripped and closed with me"
"2540",35,"again. In a moment I knew what had happened. I had slept, and my fire"
"2541",35,"had gone out, and the bitterness of death came over my soul. The forest"
"2542",35,"seemed full of the smell of burning wood. I was caught by the neck, by"

"2544",35,"in the darkness to feel all these soft creatures heaped upon me. I felt"
"2545",35,"as if I was in a monstrous spider’s web. I was overpowered, and went"
"2546",35,"down. I felt little teeth nipping at my neck. I rolled over, and as I"
"2547",35,"did so my hand came against my iron lever. It gave me strength. I"
"2548",35,"struggled up, shaking the human rats from me, and, holding the bar"
"2549",35,"short, I thrust where I judged their faces might be. I could feel the"

"3059",35,"is a dream, a precious poor dream at times—but I can’t stand another"
"3060",35,"that won’t fit. It’s madness. And where did the dream come from? … I"

"3063",35,"He caught up the lamp swiftly, and carried it, flaring red, through the"
"3064",35,"door into the corridor. We followed him. There in the flickering light"
"3065",35,"of the lamp was the machine sure enough, squat, ugly, and askew, a"
"3066",35,"thing of brass, ebony, ivory, and translucent glimmering quartz. Solid"
"3067",35,"to the touch—for I put out my hand and felt the rail of it—and with"
"3068",35,"brown spots and smears upon the ivory, and bits of grass and moss upon"
"3069",35,"the lower parts, and one rail bent awry."
"3070",35,""
"3071",35,"The Time Traveller put the lamp down on the bench, and ran his hand"
"3072",35,"along the damaged rail. “It’s all right now,” he said. “The story I"
"3073",35,"told you was true. I’m sorry to have brought you out here in the cold.”"
"3074",35,"He took up the lamp, and, in an absolute silence, we returned to the"
"3075",35,"smoking-room."
"3076",35,""
"3077",35,"He came into the hall with us and helped the Editor on with his coat."
"3078",35,"The Medical Man looked into his face and, with a certain hesitation,"
"3079",35,"told him he was suffering from overwork, at which he laughed hugely. I"
"3080",35,"remember him standing in the open doorway, bawling good-night."
"3081",35,""
"3082",35,"I shared a cab with the Editor. He thought the tale a “gaudy lie.” For"
"3083",35,"my own part I was unable to come to a conclusion. The story was so"
"3084",35,"fantastic and incredible, the telling so credible and sober. I lay"
"3085",35,"awake most of the night thinking about it. I determined to go next day"
"3086",35,"and see the Time Traveller again. I was told he was in the laboratory,"
"3087",35,"and being on easy terms in the house, I went up to him. The laboratory,"
"3088",35,"however, was empty. I stared for a minute at the Time Machine and put"
"3089",35,"out my hand and touched the lever. At that the squat"
"3090",35,"substantial-looking mass swayed like a bough shaken by the wind. Its"
"3091",35,"instability startled me extremely, and I had a queer reminiscence of"
"3092",35,"the childish days when I used to be forbidden to meddle. I came back"
"3093",35,"through the corridor. The Time Traveller met me in the smoking-room. He"
"3094",35,"was coming from the house. He had a small camera under one arm and a"
"3095",35,"knapsack under the other. He laughed when he saw me, and gave me an"
"3096",35,"elbow to shake. “I’m frightfully busy,” said he, “with that thing in"
"3097",35,"there.”"
"3098",35,""
"3099",35,"“But is it not some hoax?” I said. “Do you really travel through time?”"
"3100",35,""
"3101",35,"“Really and truly I do.” And he looked frankly into my eyes. He"
"3102",35,"hesitated. His eye wandered about the room. “I only want half an hour,”"
"3103",35,"he said. “I know why you came, and it’s awfully good of you. There’s"
"3104",35,"some magazines here. If you’ll stop to lunch I’ll prove you this time"
"3105",35,"travelling up to the hilt, specimens and all. If you’ll forgive my"
"3106",35,"leaving you now?”"
"3107",35,""
"3108",35,"I consented, hardly comprehending then the full import of his words,"
"3109",35,"and he nodded and went on down the corridor. I heard the door of the"
"3110",35,"laboratory slam, seated myself in a chair, and took up a daily paper."
"3111",35,"What was he going to do before lunch-time? Then suddenly I was reminded"
"3112",35,"by an advertisement that I had promised to meet Richardson, the"
"3113",35,"publisher, at two. I looked at my watch, and saw that I could barely"
"3114",35,"save that engagement. I got up and went down the passage to tell the"
"3115",35,"Time Traveller."
"3116",35,""
"3117",35,"As I took hold of the handle of the door I heard an exclamation, oddly"
"3118",35,"truncated at the end, and a click and a thud. A gust of air whirled"
"3119",35,"round me as I opened the door, and from within came the sound of broken"
"3120",35,"glass falling on the floor. The Time Traveller was not there. I seemed"
"3121",35,"to see a ghostly, indistinct figure sitting in a whirling mass of black"
"3122",35,"and brass for a moment—a figure so transparent that the bench behind"
"3123",35,"with its sheets of drawings was absolutely distinct; but this phantasm"
"3124",35,"vanished as I rubbed my eyes. The Time Machine had gone. Save for a"
"3125",35,"subsiding stir of dust, the further end of the laboratory was empty. A"
"3126",35,"pane of the skylight had, apparently, just been blown in."
"3127",35,""
"3128",35,"I felt an unreasonable amazement. I knew that something strange had"
"3129",35,"happened, and for the moment could not distinguish what the strange"
"3130",35,"thing might be. As I stood staring, the door into the garden opened,"
"3131",35,"and the man-servant appeared."
"3132",35,""
"3133",35,"We looked at each other. Then ideas began to come. “Has Mr. —— gone out"
"3134",35,"that way?” said I."
"3135",35,""
"3136",35,"“No, sir. No one has come out this way. I was expecting to find him"
"3137",35,"here.”"
"3138",35,""
"3139",35,"At that I understood. At the risk of disappointing Richardson I stayed"
"3140",35,"on, waiting for the Time Traveller; waiting for the second, perhaps"
"3141",35,"still stranger story, and the specimens and photographs he would bring"
"3142",35,"with him. But I am beginning now to fear that I must wait a lifetime."
"3143",35,"The Time Traveller vanished three years ago. And, as everybody knows"
"3144",35,"now, he has never returned."

"3152",35,"One cannot choose but wonder. Will he ever return? It may be that he"
"3153",35,"swept back into the past, and fell among the blood-drinking, hairy"
"3154",35,"savages of the Age of Unpolished Stone; into the abysses of the"
"3155",35,"Cretaceous Sea; or among the grotesque saurians, the huge reptilian"

"3157",35,"phrase—be wandering on some plesiosaurus-haunted Oolitic coral reef, or"
"3158",35,"beside the lonely saline seas of the Triassic Age. Or did he go"

"3243",36,""
"3244",36,"No one would have believed in the last years of the nineteenth century"
"3245",36,"that this world was being watched keenly and closely by intelligences"
"3246",36,"greater than man’s and yet as mortal as his own; that as men busied"
"3247",36,"themselves about their various concerns they were scrutinised and"
"3248",36,"studied, perhaps almost as narrowly as a man with a microscope might"
"3249",36,"scrutinise the transient creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of"
"3250",36,"water. With infinite complacency men went to and fro over this globe"
"3251",36,"about their little affairs, serene in their assurance of their empire"
"3252",36,"over matter. It is possible that the infusoria under the microscope do"
"3253",36,"the same. No one gave a thought to the older worlds of space as sources"
"3254",36,"of human danger, or thought of them only to dismiss the idea of life"
"3255",36,"upon them as impossible or improbable. It is curious to recall some of"
"3256",36,"the mental habits of those departed days. At most terrestrial men"
"3257",36,"fancied there might be other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to"
"3258",36,"themselves and ready to welcome a missionary enterprise. Yet across the"
"3259",36,"gulf of space, minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the"
"3260",36,"beasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic,"
"3261",36,"regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their"
"3262",36,"plans against us. And early in the twentieth century came the great"
"3263",36,"disillusionment."
"3264",36,""
"3265",36,"The planet Mars, I scarcely need remind the reader, revolves about the"
"3266",36,"sun at a mean distance of 140,000,000 miles, and the light and heat it"
"3267",36,"receives from the sun is barely half of that received by this world. It"
"3268",36,"must be, if the nebular hypothesis has any truth, older than our world;"
"3269",36,"and long before this earth ceased to be molten, life upon its surface"
"3270",36,"must have begun its course. The fact that it is scarcely one seventh of"
"3271",36,"the volume of the earth must have accelerated its cooling to the"
"3272",36,"temperature at which life could begin. It has air and water and all"
"3273",36,"that is necessary for the support of animated existence."
"3274",36,""
"3275",36,"Yet so vain is man, and so blinded by his vanity, that no writer, up to"
"3276",36,"the very end of the nineteenth century, expressed any idea that"
"3277",36,"intelligent life might have developed there far, or indeed at all,"
"3278",36,"beyond its earthly level. Nor was it generally understood that since"
"3279",36,"Mars is older than our earth, with scarcely a quarter of the"
"3280",36,"superficial area and remoter from the sun, it necessarily follows that"
"3281",36,"it is not only more distant from time’s beginning but nearer its end."
"3282",36,""
"3283",36,"The secular cooling that must someday overtake our planet has already"
"3284",36,"gone far indeed with our neighbour. Its physical condition is still"
"3285",36,"largely a mystery, but we know now that even in its equatorial region"
"3286",36,"the midday temperature barely approaches that of our coldest winter."
"3287",36,"Its air is much more attenuated than ours, its oceans have shrunk until"
"3288",36,"they cover but a third of its surface, and as its slow seasons change"
"3289",36,"huge snowcaps gather and melt about either pole and periodically"
"3290",36,"inundate its temperate zones. That last stage of exhaustion, which to"
"3291",36,"us is still incredibly remote, has become a present-day problem for the"
"3292",36,"inhabitants of Mars. The immediate pressure of necessity has brightened"
"3293",36,"their intellects, enlarged their powers, and hardened their hearts. And"
"3294",36,"looking across space with instruments, and intelligences such as we"
"3295",36,"have scarcely dreamed of, they see, at its nearest distance only"
"3296",36,"35,000,000 of miles sunward of them, a morning star of hope, our own"
"3297",36,"warmer planet, green with vegetation and grey with water, with a cloudy"
"3298",36,"atmosphere eloquent of fertility, with glimpses through its drifting"
"3299",36,"cloud wisps of broad stretches of populous country and narrow,"
"3300",36,"navy-crowded seas."
"3301",36,""
"3302",36,"And we men, the creatures who inhabit this earth, must be to them at"
"3303",36,"least as alien and lowly as are the monkeys and lemurs to us. The"
"3304",36,"intellectual side of man already admits that life is an incessant"
"3305",36,"struggle for existence, and it would seem that this too is the belief"
"3306",36,"of the minds upon Mars. Their world is far gone in its cooling and this"
"3307",36,"world is still crowded with life, but crowded only with what they"
"3308",36,"regard as inferior animals. To carry warfare sunward is, indeed, their"
"3309",36,"only escape from the destruction that, generation after generation,"
"3310",36,"creeps upon them."
"3311",36,""
"3312",36,"And before we judge of them too harshly we must remember what ruthless"
"3313",36,"and utter destruction our own species has wrought, not only upon"
"3314",36,"animals, such as the vanished bison and the dodo, but upon its inferior"
"3315",36,"races. The Tasmanians, in spite of their human likeness, were entirely"
"3316",36,"swept out of existence in a war of extermination waged by European"
"3317",36,"immigrants, in the space of fifty years. Are we such apostles of mercy"
"3318",36,"as to complain if the Martians warred in the same spirit?"
"3319",36,""
"3320",36,"The Martians seem to have calculated their descent with amazing"
"3321",36,"subtlety—their mathematical learning is evidently far in excess of"
"3322",36,"ours—and to have carried out their preparations with a well-nigh"
"3323",36,"perfect unanimity. Had our instruments permitted it, we might have seen"
"3324",36,"the gathering trouble far back in the nineteenth century. Men like"
"3325",36,"Schiaparelli watched the red planet—it is odd, by-the-bye, that for"
"3326",36,"countless centuries Mars has been the star of war—but failed to"
"3327",36,"interpret the fluctuating appearances of the markings they mapped so"
"3328",36,"well. All that time the Martians must have been getting ready."
"3329",36,""
"3330",36,"During the opposition of 1894 a great light was seen on the illuminated"
"3331",36,"part of the disk, first at the Lick Observatory, then by Perrotin of"
"3332",36,"Nice, and then by other observers. English readers heard of it first in"
"3333",36,"the issue of _Nature_ dated August 2. I am inclined to think that this"
"3334",36,"blaze may have been the casting of the huge gun, in the vast pit sunk"
"3335",36,"into their planet, from which their shots were fired at us. Peculiar"
"3336",36,"markings, as yet unexplained, were seen near the site of that outbreak"
"3337",36,"during the next two oppositions."
"3338",36,""
"3339",36,"The storm burst upon us six years ago now. As Mars approached"
"3340",36,"opposition, Lavelle of Java set the wires of the astronomical exchange"
"3341",36,"palpitating with the amazing intelligence of a huge outbreak of"
"3342",36,"incandescent gas upon the planet. It had occurred towards midnight of"
"3343",36,"the twelfth; and the spectroscope, to which he had at once resorted,"
"3344",36,"indicated a mass of flaming gas, chiefly hydrogen, moving with an"
"3345",36,"enormous velocity towards this earth. This jet of fire had become"
"3346",36,"invisible about a quarter past twelve. He compared it to a colossal"
"3347",36,"puff of flame suddenly and violently squirted out of the planet, “as"
"3348",36,"flaming gases rushed out of a gun.”"
"3349",36,""
"3350",36,"A singularly appropriate phrase it proved. Yet the next day there was"
"3351",36,"nothing of this in the papers except a little note in the _Daily"
"3352",36,"Telegraph_, and the world went in ignorance of one of the gravest"
"3353",36,"dangers that ever threatened the human race. I might not have heard of"
"3354",36,"the eruption at all had I not met Ogilvy, the well-known astronomer, at"
"3355",36,"Ottershaw. He was immensely excited at the news, and in the excess of"
"3356",36,"his feelings invited me up to take a turn with him that night in a"
"3357",36,"scrutiny of the red planet."
"3358",36,""
"3359",36,"In spite of all that has happened since, I still remember that vigil"
"3360",36,"very distinctly: the black and silent observatory, the shadowed lantern"
"3361",36,"throwing a feeble glow upon the floor in the corner, the steady ticking"
"3362",36,"of the clockwork of the telescope, the little slit in the roof—an"
"3363",36,"oblong profundity with the stardust streaked across it. Ogilvy moved"
"3364",36,"about, invisible but audible. Looking through the telescope, one saw a"
"3365",36,"circle of deep blue and the little round planet swimming in the field."
"3366",36,"It seemed such a little thing, so bright and small and still, faintly"
"3367",36,"marked with transverse stripes, and slightly flattened from the perfect"
"3368",36,"round. But so little it was, so silvery warm—a pin’s head of light! It"
"3369",36,"was as if it quivered, but really this was the telescope vibrating with"
"3370",36,"the activity of the clockwork that kept the planet in view."
"3371",36,""
"3372",36,"As I watched, the planet seemed to grow larger and smaller and to"
"3373",36,"advance and recede, but that was simply that my eye was tired. Forty"
"3374",36,"millions of miles it was from us—more than forty millions of miles of"
"3375",36,"void. Few people realise the immensity of vacancy in which the dust of"
"3376",36,"the material universe swims."
"3377",36,""
"3378",36,"Near it in the field, I remember, were three faint points of light,"
"3379",36,"three telescopic stars infinitely remote, and all around it was the"
"3380",36,"unfathomable darkness of empty space. You know how that blackness looks"
"3381",36,"on a frosty starlight night. In a telescope it seems far profounder."
"3382",36,"And invisible to me because it was so remote and small, flying swiftly"
"3383",36,"and steadily towards me across that incredible distance, drawing nearer"
"3384",36,"every minute by so many thousands of miles, came the Thing they were"
"3385",36,"sending us, the Thing that was to bring so much struggle and calamity"
"3386",36,"and death to the earth. I never dreamed of it then as I watched; no one"
"3387",36,"on earth dreamed of that unerring missile."
"3388",36,""
"3389",36,"That night, too, there was another jetting out of gas from the distant"
"3390",36,"planet. I saw it. A reddish flash at the edge, the slightest projection"
"3391",36,"of the outline just as the chronometer struck midnight; and at that I"
"3392",36,"told Ogilvy and he took my place. The night was warm and I was thirsty,"
"3393",36,"and I went stretching my legs clumsily and feeling my way in the"
"3394",36,"darkness, to the little table where the siphon stood, while Ogilvy"
"3395",36,"exclaimed at the streamer of gas that came out towards us."
"3396",36,""
"3397",36,"That night another invisible missile started on its way to the earth"
"3398",36,"from Mars, just a second or so under twenty-four hours after the first"
"3399",36,"one. I remember how I sat on the table there in the blackness, with"
"3400",36,"patches of green and crimson swimming before my eyes. I wished I had a"
"3401",36,"light to smoke by, little suspecting the meaning of the minute gleam I"
"3402",36,"had seen and all that it would presently bring me. Ogilvy watched till"
"3403",36,"one, and then gave it up; and we lit the lantern and walked over to his"
"3404",36,"house. Down below in the darkness were Ottershaw and Chertsey and all"
"3405",36,"their hundreds of people, sleeping in peace."
"3406",36,""
"3407",36,"He was full of speculation that night about the condition of Mars, and"
"3408",36,"scoffed at the vulgar idea of its having inhabitants who were"
"3409",36,"signalling us. His idea was that meteorites might be falling in a heavy"

"3485",36,"finding it. Find it he did, soon after dawn, and not far from the"
"3486",36,"sand-pits. An enormous hole had been made by the impact of the"

"3495",36,"caked over and its outline softened by a thick scaly dun-coloured"

"3507",36,"of design in its arrival. The early morning was wonderfully still, and"
"3508",36,"the sun, just clearing the pine trees towards Weybridge, was already"

"3510",36,"certainly no breeze stirring, and the only sounds were the faint"
"3511",36,"movements from within the cindery cylinder. He was all alone on the"
"3512",36,"common."

"3514",36,"Then suddenly he noticed with a start that some of the grey clinker,"
"3515",36,"the ashy incrustation that covered the meteorite, was falling off the"
"3516",36,"circular edge of the end. It was dropping off in flakes and raining"
"3517",36,"down upon the sand. A large piece suddenly came off and fell with a"

"3524",36,"fact that the ash was falling only from the end of the cylinder."

"3772",36,"way back from the edge of the pit. I saw astonishment giving place to"
"3773",36,"horror on the faces of the people about me. I heard inarticulate"
"3774",36,"exclamations on all sides. There was a general movement backwards. I"

"3786",36,"might say, a face. There was a mouth under the eyes, the lipless brim"
"3787",36,"of which quivered and panted, and dropped saliva. The whole creature"
"3788",36,"heaved and pulsated convulsively. A lank tentacular appendage gripped"
"3789",36,"the edge of the cylinder, another swayed in the air."
"3790",36,""
"3791",36,"Those who have never seen a living Martian can scarcely imagine the"
"3792",36,"strange horror of its appearance. The peculiar V-shaped mouth with its"

"3794",36,"beneath the wedgelike lower lip, the incessant quivering of this mouth,"
"3795",36,"the Gorgon groups of tentacles, the tumultuous breathing of the lungs"

"3797",36,"movement due to the greater gravitational energy of the earth—above"

"3817",36,"half-fascinated terror, staring at these creatures, or rather at the"
"3818",36,"heaped gravel at the edge of the pit in which they lay. And then, with"
"3819",36,"a renewed horror, I saw a round, black object bobbing up and down on"
"3820",36,"the edge of the pit. It was the head of the shopman who had fallen in,"
"3821",36,"but showing as a little black object against the hot western sun. Now"
"3822",36,"he got his shoulder and knee up, and again he seemed to slip back until"
"3823",36,"only his head was visible. Suddenly he vanished, and I could have"

"3887",36,"black figures in twos and threes would advance, stop, watch, and"

"3896",36,"black knot of men, the foremost of whom was waving a white flag."

"3898",36,"This was the Deputation. There had been a hasty consultation, and since"

"3907",36,"inward, so to speak, the circumference of the now almost complete"
"3908",36,"circle of people, and a number of dim black figures followed it at"
"3909",36,"discreet distances."
"3910",36,""
"3911",36,"Suddenly there was a flash of light, and a quantity of luminous"
"3912",36,"greenish smoke came out of the pit in three distinct puffs, which drove"
"3913",36,"up, one after the other, straight into the still air."

"3921",36,"Beyond the pit stood the little wedge of people with the white flag at"

"3923",36,"black shapes upon the black ground. As the green smoke arose, their"
"3924",36,"faces flashed out pallid green, and faded again as it vanished. Then"
"3925",36,"slowly the hissing passed into a humming, into a long, loud, droning"
"3926",36,"noise. Slowly a humped shape rose out of the pit, and the ghost of a"

"3928",36,""
"3929",36,"Forthwith flashes of actual flame, a bright glare leaping from one to"

"3932",36,"as if each man were suddenly and momentarily turned to fire."

"3939",36,"something very strange. An almost noiseless and blinding flash of"
"3940",36,"light, and a man fell headlong and lay still; and as the unseen shaft"
"3941",36,"of heat passed over them, pine trees burst into fire, and every dry"
"3942",36,"furze bush became with one dull thud a mass of flames. And far away"
"3943",36,"towards Knaphill I saw the flashes of trees and hedges and wooden"

"3949",36,"to stir. I heard the crackle of fire in the sand-pits and the sudden"
"3950",36,"squeal of a horse that was as suddenly stilled. Then it was as if an"
"3951",36,"invisible yet intensely heated finger were drawn through the heather"
"3952",36,"between me and the Martians, and all along a curving line beyond the"
"3953",36,"sand-pits the dark ground smoked and crackled. Something fell with a"
"3954",36,"crash far away to the left where the road from Woking station opens out"
"3955",36,"on the common. Forth-with the hissing and humming ceased, and the"

"3967",36,"mustering, and in the west the sky was still a pale, bright, almost"
"3968",36,"greenish blue. The tops of the pine trees and the roofs of Horsell came"

"4201",36,"the surface of the earth the force of gravity is three times what it is"

"4262",36,"on the common, whose emotions or habits were at all affected by the"
"4263",36,"new-comers. Many people had heard of the cylinder, of course, and"

"4275",36,"working men were gardening after the labours of the day, children were"

"4280",36,"topic in the public-houses, and here and there a messenger, or even an"
"4281",36,"eye-witness of the later occurrences, caused a whirl of excitement, a"
"4282",36,"shouting, and a running to and fro; but for the most part the daily"
"4283",36,"routine of working, eating, drinking, sleeping, went on as it had done"
"4284",36,"for countless years—as though no planet Mars existed in the sky. Even"

"4290",36,"from the town, trenching on Smith’s monopoly, was selling papers with"
"4291",36,"the afternoon’s news. The ringing impact of trucks, the sharp whistle"
"4292",36,"of the engines from the junction, mingled with their shouts of “Men"
"4293",36,"from Mars!” Excited men came into the station about nine o’clock with"
"4294",36,"incredible tidings, and caused no more disturbance than drunkards might"
"4295",36,"have done. People rattling Londonwards peered into the darkness outside"
"4296",36,"the carriage windows, and saw only a rare, flickering, vanishing spark"
"4297",36,"dance up from the direction of Horsell, a red glow and a thin veil of"
"4298",36,"smoke driving across the stars, and thought that nothing more serious"
"4299",36,"than a heath fire was happening. It was only round the edge of the"
"4300",36,"common that any disturbance was perceptible. There were half a dozen"
"4301",36,"villas burning on the Woking border. There were lights in all the"
"4302",36,"houses on the common side of the three villages, and the people there"

"4309",36,"again a light-ray, like the beam of a warship’s searchlight swept the"
"4310",36,"common, and the Heat-Ray was ready to follow. Save for such, that big"
"4311",36,"area of common was silent and desolate, and the charred bodies lay"

"4318",36,"was a patch of silent common, smouldering in places, and with a few"
"4319",36,"dark, dimly seen objects lying in contorted attitudes here and there."
"4320",36,"Here and there was a burning bush or tree. Beyond was a fringe of"
"4321",36,"excitement, and farther than that fringe the inflammation had not crept"
"4322",36,"as yet. In the rest of the world the stream of life still flowed as it"
"4323",36,"had flowed for immemorial years. The fever of war that would presently"
"4324",36,"clog vein and artery, deaden nerve and destroy brain, had still to"
"4325",36,"develop."

"4327",36,"All night long the Martians were hammering and stirring, sleepless,"
"4328",36,"indefatigable, at work upon the machines they were making ready, and"

"4361",36,"a lark."
"4362",36,""
"4363",36,"The milkman came as usual. I heard the rattle of his chariot and I went"
"4364",36,"round to the side gate to ask the latest news. He told me that during"
"4365",36,"the night the Martians had been surrounded by troops, and that guns"
"4366",36,"were expected. Then—a familiar, reassuring note—I heard a train running"

"4375",36,"destroy the Martians during the day."
"4376",36,""
"4377",36,"“It’s a pity they make themselves so unapproachable,” he said. “It"

"4379",36,"learn a thing or two.”"
"4380",36,""
"4381",36,"He came up to the fence and extended a handful of strawberries, for his"
"4382",36,"gardening was as generous as it was enthusiastic. At the same time he"
"4383",36,"told me of the burning of the pine woods about the Byfleet Golf Links."
"4384",36,""
"4385",36,"“They say,” said he, “that there’s another of those blessed things"
"4386",36,"fallen there—number two. But one’s enough, surely. This lot’ll cost the"
"4387",36,"insurance people a pretty penny before everything’s settled.” He"
"4388",36,"laughed with an air of the greatest good humour as he said this. The"
"4389",36,"woods, he said, were still burning, and pointed out a haze of smoke to"
"4390",36,"me. “They will be hot under foot for days, on account of the thick soil"
"4391",36,"of pine needles and turf,” he said, and then grew serious over “poor"
"4392",36,"Ogilvy.”"
"4393",36,""
"4394",36,"After breakfast, instead of working, I decided to walk down towards the"
"4395",36,"common. Under the railway bridge I found a group of soldiers—sappers, I"
"4396",36,"think, men in small round caps, dirty red jackets unbuttoned, and"
"4397",36,"showing their blue shirts, dark trousers, and boots coming to the calf."
"4398",36,"They told me no one was allowed over the canal, and, looking along the"
"4399",36,"road towards the bridge, I saw one of the Cardigan men standing"
"4400",36,"sentinel there. I talked with these soldiers for a time; I told them of"
"4401",36,"my sight of the Martians on the previous evening. None of them had seen"
"4402",36,"the Martians, and they had but the vaguest ideas of them, so that they"
"4403",36,"plied me with questions. They said that they did not know who had"
"4404",36,"authorised the movements of the troops; their idea was that a dispute"
"4405",36,"had arisen at the Horse Guards. The ordinary sapper is a great deal"
"4406",36,"better educated than the common soldier, and they discussed the"
"4407",36,"peculiar conditions of the possible fight with some acuteness. I"
"4408",36,"described the Heat-Ray to them, and they began to argue among"
"4409",36,"themselves."
"4410",36,""
"4411",36,"“Crawl up under cover and rush ’em, say I,” said one."
"4412",36,""

"4445",36,"heard for the first time from Marshall, the tobacconist, that his son"

"4452",36,"railway station to get an evening paper, for the morning papers had"
"4453",36,"contained only a very inaccurate description of the killing of Stent,"
"4454",36,"Henderson, Ogilvy, and the others. But there was little I didn’t know."

"4458",36,"struggle. “Fresh attempts have been made to signal, but without"
"4459",36,"success,” was the stereotyped formula of the papers. A sapper told me"
"4460",36,"it was done by a man in a ditch with a flag on a long pole. The"

"4478",36,"summerhouse talking vigorously about the battle that was lowering upon"

"4480",36,"a gust of firing. Close on the heels of that came a violent rattling"
"4481",36,"crash, quite close to us, that shook the ground; and, starting out upon"
"4482",36,"the lawn, I saw the tops of the trees about the Oriental College burst"
"4483",36,"into smoky red flame, and the tower of the little church beside it"
"4484",36,"slide down into ruin. The pinnacle of the mosque had vanished, and the"
"4485",36,"roof line of the college itself looked as if a hundred-ton gun had been"
"4486",36,"at work upon it. One of our chimneys cracked as if a shot had hit it,"
"4487",36,"flew, and a piece of it came clattering down the tiles and made a heap"

"4510",36,"“How are we to get to Leatherhead?” she said."

"4512",36,"Down the hill I saw a bevy of hussars ride under the railway bridge;"
"4513",36,"three galloped through the open gates of the Oriental College; two"
"4514",36,"others dismounted, and began running from house to house. The sun,"
"4515",36,"shining through the smoke that drove up from the tops of the trees,"
"4516",36,"seemed blood red, and threw an unfamiliar lurid light upon everything."
"4517",36,""
"4518",36,"“Stop here,” said I; “you are safe here”; and I started off at once for"
"4519",36,"the Spotted Dog, for I knew the landlord had a horse and dog cart. I"
"4520",36,"ran, for I perceived that in a moment everyone upon this side of the"
"4521",36,"hill would be moving. I found him in his bar, quite unaware of what was"
"4522",36,"going on behind his house. A man stood with his back to me, talking to"

"4534",36,"“Lord!” said the landlord; “what’s the hurry? I’m selling my bit of a"
"4535",36,"pig. Two pounds, and you bring it back? What’s going on now?”"
"4536",36,""
"4537",36,"I explained hastily that I had to leave my home, and so secured the dog"
"4538",36,"cart. At the time it did not seem to me nearly so urgent that the"

"4540",36,"drove it off down the road, and, leaving it in charge of my wife and"
"4541",36,"servant, rushed into my house and packed a few valuables, such plate as"
"4542",36,"we had, and so forth. The beech trees below the house were burning"
"4543",36,"while I did this, and the palings up the road glowed red. While I was"
"4544",36,"occupied in this way, one of the dismounted hussars came running up. He"
"4545",36,"was going from house to house, warning people to leave. He was going on"
"4546",36,"as I came out of my front door, lugging my treasures, done up in a"
"4547",36,"tablecloth. I shouted after him:"

"4550",36,""
"4551",36,"He turned, stared, bawled something about “crawling out in a thing like"

"4554",36,"moment. I ran to my neighbour’s door and rapped to satisfy myself of"
"4555",36,"what I already knew, that his wife had gone to London with him and had"
"4556",36,"locked up their house. I went in again, according to my promise, to get"
"4557",36,"my servant’s box, lugged it out, clapped it beside her on the tail of"
"4558",36,"the dog cart, and then caught the reins and jumped up into the driver’s"
"4559",36,"seat beside my wife. In another moment we were clear of the smoke and"

"4561",36,"Woking."
"4562",36,""
"4563",36,"In front was a quiet sunny landscape, a wheat field ahead on either"
"4564",36,"side of the road, and the Maybury Inn with its swinging sign. I saw the"
"4565",36,"doctor’s cart ahead of me. At the bottom of the hill I turned my head"
"4566",36,"to look at the hillside I was leaving. Thick streamers of black smoke"
"4567",36,"shot with threads of red fire were driving up into the still air, and"
"4568",36,"throwing dark shadows upon the green treetops eastward. The smoke"
"4569",36,"already extended far away to the east and west—to the Byfleet pine"
"4570",36,"woods eastward, and to Woking on the west. The road was dotted with"
"4571",36,"people running towards us. And very faint now, but very distinct"
"4572",36,"through the hot, quiet air, one heard the whirr of a machine-gun that"
"4573",36,"was presently stilled, and an intermittent cracking of rifles."

"4577",36,"I am not an expert driver, and I had immediately to turn my attention"
"4578",36,"to the horse. When I looked back again the second hill had hidden the"
"4579",36,"black smoke. I slashed the horse with the whip, and gave him a loose"
"4580",36,"rein until Woking and Send lay between us and that quivering tumult. I"

"4593",36,"heavy firing that had broken out while we were driving down Maybury"
"4594",36,"Hill ceased as abruptly as it began, leaving the evening very peaceful"
"4595",36,"and still. We got to Leatherhead without misadventure about nine"
"4596",36,"o’clock, and the horse had an hour’s rest while I took supper with my"

"4599",36,"My wife was curiously silent throughout the drive, and seemed oppressed"

"4601",36,"that the Martians were tied to the pit by sheer heaviness, and at the"
"4602",36,"utmost could but crawl a little out of it; but she answered only in"
"4603",36,"monosyllables. Had it not been for my promise to the innkeeper, she"

"4618",36,"the day. Overhead the clouds were driving fast, albeit not a breath"
"4619",36,"stirred the shrubs about us. My cousins’ man lit both lamps. Happily, I"
"4620",36,"knew the road intimately. My wife stood in the light of the doorway,"
"4621",36,"and watched me until I jumped up into the dog cart. Then abruptly she"

"4629",36,"the conflict. As I came through Ockham (for that was the way I"
"4630",36,"returned, and not through Send and Old Woking) I saw along the western"
"4631",36,"horizon a blood-red glow, which as I drew nearer, crept slowly up the"

"4647",36,"trees about me shivered with the first intimation of the storm that was"
"4648",36,"upon me. Then I heard midnight pealing out from Pyrford Church behind"

"4658",36,"Close on its apparition, and blindingly violet by contrast, danced out"

"4665",36,"one on the heels of another and with a strange crackling accompaniment,"
"4666",36,"sounded more like the working of a gigantic electric machine than the"
"4667",36,"usual detonating reverberations. The flickering light was blinding and"
"4668",36,"confusing, and a thin hail smote gustily at my face as I drove down the"

"4674",36,"a house, but one flash following another showed it to be in swift"
"4675",36,"rolling movement. It was an elusive vision—a moment of bewildering"
"4676",36,"darkness, and then, in a flash like daylight, the red masses of the"
"4677",36,"Orphanage near the crest of the hill, the green tops of the pine trees,"
"4678",36,"and this problematical object came out clear and sharp and bright."
"4679",36,""
"4680",36,"And this Thing I saw! How can I describe it? A monstrous tripod, higher"

"4682",36,"aside in its career; a walking engine of glittering metal, striding now"
"4683",36,"across the heather; articulate ropes of steel dangling from it, and the"
"4684",36,"clattering tumult of its passage mingling with the riot of the thunder."
"4685",36,"A flash, and it came out vividly, heeling over one way with two feet in"
"4686",36,"the air, to vanish and reappear almost instantly as it seemed, with the"
"4687",36,"next flash, a hundred yards nearer. Can you imagine a milking stool"
"4688",36,"tilted and bowled violently along the ground? That was the impression"
"4689",36,"those instant flashes gave. But instead of a milking stool imagine it a"

"4695",36,"rushing, as it seemed, headlong towards me. And I was galloping hard to"

"4705",36,"of the overturned dog cart and the silhouette of the wheel still"
"4706",36,"spinning slowly. In another moment the colossal mechanism went striding"
"4707",36,"by me, and passed uphill towards Pyrford."

"4711",36,"metallic pace, and long, flexible, glittering tentacles (one of which"
"4712",36,"gripped a young pine tree) swinging and rattling about its strange"
"4713",36,"body. It picked its road as it went striding along, and the brazen hood"
"4714",36,"that surmounted it moved to and fro with the inevitable suggestion of a"
"4715",36,"head looking about. Behind the main body was a huge mass of white metal"
"4716",36,"like a gigantic fisherman’s basket, and puffs of green smoke squirted"
"4717",36,"out from the joints of the limbs as the monster swept by me. And in an"

"4845",36,"houses about Woking station, and on the other to the charred and"
"4846",36,"blackened pine woods of Byfleet. There was a light down below the hill,"
"4847",36,"on the railway, near the arch, and several of the houses along the"
"4848",36,"Maybury road and the streets near the station were glowing ruins. The"
"4849",36,"light upon the railway puzzled me at first; there were a black heap and"
"4850",36,"a vivid glare, and to the right of that a row of yellow oblongs. Then I"

"4856",36,"country, broken here and there by intervals of dimly glowing and"
"4857",36,"smoking ground. It was the strangest spectacle, that black expanse set"
"4858",36,"with fire. It reminded me, more than anything else, of the Potteries at"
"4859",36,"night. At first I could distinguish no people at all, though I peered"
"4860",36,"intently for them. Later I saw against the light of Woking station a"

"4866",36,"the relation between these mechanical colossi and the sluggish lumps I"

"4956",36,"turning about exactly like the head of a cowled human being. A kind of"

"4963",36,"on the road beyond the curvature of the ground, and he saw nothing of"
"4964",36,"them. He heard the Maxims rattle for a time and then become still. The"

"4966",36,"then in a moment the Heat-Ray was brought to bear, and the town became"
"4967",36,"a heap of fiery ruins. Then the Thing shut off the Heat-Ray, and"
"4968",36,"turning its back upon the artilleryman, began to waddle away towards"

"4975",36,"road, and so escaped to Woking. There his story became ejaculatory. The"
"4976",36,"place was impassable. It seems there were a few people alive there,"
"4977",36,"frantic for the most part and many burned and scalded. He was turned"
"4978",36,"aside by the fire, and hid among some almost scorching heaps of broken"
"4979",36,"wall as one of the Martian giants returned. He saw this one pursue a"
"4980",36,"man, catch him up in one of its steely tentacles, and knock his head"
"4981",36,"against the trunk of a pine tree. At last, after nightfall, the"
"4982",36,"artilleryman made a rush for it and got over the railway embankment."
"4983",36,""
"4984",36,"Since then he had been skulking along towards Maybury, in the hope of"
"4985",36,"getting out of danger Londonward. People were hiding in trenches and"
"4986",36,"cellars, and many of the survivors had made off towards Woking village"
"4987",36,"and Send. He had been consumed with thirst until he found one of the"
"4988",36,"water mains near the railway arch smashed, and the water bubbling out"
"4989",36,"like a spring upon the road."
"4990",36,""
"4991",36,"That was the story I got from him, bit by bit. He grew calmer telling"
"4992",36,"me and trying to make me see the things he had seen. He had eaten no"
"4993",36,"food since midday, he told me early in his narrative, and I found some"
"4994",36,"mutton and bread in the pantry and brought it into the room. We lit no"
"4995",36,"lamp for fear of attracting the Martians, and ever and again our hands"
"4996",36,"would touch upon bread or meat. As he talked, things about us came"
"4997",36,"darkly out of the darkness, and the trampled bushes and broken rose"
"4998",36,"trees outside the window grew distinct. It would seem that a number of"
"4999",36,"men or animals had rushed across the lawn. I began to see his face,"

"5006",36,"and gutted houses and blasted and blackened trees that the night had"
"5007",36,"hidden stood out now gaunt and terrible in the pitiless light of dawn."
"5008",36,"Yet here and there some object had had the luck to escape—a white"
"5009",36,"railway signal here, the end of a greenhouse there, white and fresh"
"5010",36,"amid the wreckage. Never before in the history of warfare had"
"5011",36,"destruction been so indiscriminate and so universal. And shining with"
"5012",36,"the growing light of the east, three of the metallic giants stood about"
"5013",36,"the pit, their cowls rotating as though they were surveying the"
"5014",36,"desolation they had made."

"5016",36,"It seemed to me that the pit had been enlarged, and ever and again"
"5017",36,"puffs of vivid green vapour streamed up and out of it towards the"
"5018",36,"brightening dawn—streamed up, whirled, broke, and vanished."

"5034",36,"He proposed, he said, to make his way Londonward, and thence rejoin his"
"5035",36,"battery—No. 12, of the Horse Artillery. My plan was to return at once"
"5036",36,"to Leatherhead; and so greatly had the strength of the Martians"
"5037",36,"impressed me that I had determined to take my wife to Newhaven, and go"
"5038",36,"with her out of the country forthwith. For I already perceived clearly"

"5053",36,"pocket with packets of biscuits and slices of meat. Then we crept out"
"5054",36,"of the house, and ran as quickly as we could down the ill-made road by"
"5055",36,"which I had come overnight. The houses seemed deserted. In the road lay"
"5056",36,"a group of three charred bodies close together, struck dead by the"
"5057",36,"Heat-Ray; and here and there were things that people had dropped—a"

"5059",36,"corner turning up towards the post office a little cart, filled with"

"5179",36,"the greatest difficulty in making them realise the gravity of their"
"5180",36,"position. We saw one shrivelled old fellow with a huge box and a score"
"5181",36,"or more of flower pots containing orchids, angrily expostulating with"
"5182",36,"the corporal who would leave them behind. I stopped and gripped his"
"5183",36,"arm."
"5184",36,""
"5185",36,"“Do you know what’s over there?” I said, pointing at the pine tops that"
"5186",36,"hid the Martians."

"5188",36,"“Eh?” said he, turning. “I was explainin’ these is vallyble.”"
"5189",36,""
"5190",36,"“Death!” I shouted. “Death is coming! Death!” and leaving him to digest"
"5191",36,"that if he could, I hurried on after the artillery-man. At the corner I"
"5192",36,"looked back. The soldier had left him, and he was still standing by his"
"5193",36,"box, with the pots of orchids on the lid of it, and staring vaguely"
"5194",36,"over the trees."
"5195",36,""
"5196",36,"No one in Weybridge could tell us where the headquarters were"
"5197",36,"established; the whole place was in such confusion as I had never seen"
"5198",36,"in any town before. Carts, carriages everywhere, the most astonishing"
"5199",36,"miscellany of conveyances and horseflesh. The respectable inhabitants"
"5200",36,"of the place, men in golf and boating costumes, wives prettily dressed,"
"5201",36,"were packing, river-side loafers energetically helping, children"
"5202",36,"excited, and, for the most part, highly delighted at this astonishing"
"5203",36,"variation of their Sunday experiences. In the midst of it all the"
"5204",36,"worthy vicar was very pluckily holding an early celebration, and his"
"5205",36,"bell was jangling out above the excitement."
"5206",36,""
"5207",36,"I and the artilleryman, seated on the step of the drinking fountain,"
"5208",36,"made a very passable meal upon what we had brought with us. Patrols of"
"5209",36,"soldiers—here no longer hussars, but grenadiers in white—were warning"
"5210",36,"people to move now or to take refuge in their cellars as soon as the"
"5211",36,"firing began. We saw as we crossed the railway bridge that a growing"
"5212",36,"crowd of people had assembled in and about the railway station, and the"
"5213",36,"swarming platform was piled with boxes and packages. The ordinary"
"5214",36,"traffic had been stopped, I believe, in order to allow of the passage"
"5215",36,"of troops and guns to Chertsey, and I have heard since that a savage"
"5216",36,"struggle occurred for places in the special trains that were put on at"
"5217",36,"a later hour."
"5218",36,""
"5219",36,"We remained at Weybridge until midday, and at that hour we found"
"5220",36,"ourselves at the place near Shepperton Lock where the Wey and Thames"
"5221",36,"join. Part of the time we spent helping two old women to pack a little"
"5222",36,"cart. The Wey has a treble mouth, and at this point boats are to be"
"5223",36,"hired, and there was a ferry across the river. On the Shepperton side"
"5224",36,"was an inn with a lawn, and beyond that the tower of Shepperton"
"5225",36,"Church—it has been replaced by a spire—rose above the trees."
"5226",36,""
"5227",36,"Here we found an excited and noisy crowd of fugitives. As yet the"
"5228",36,"flight had not grown to a panic, but there were already far more people"
"5229",36,"than all the boats going to and fro could enable to cross. People came"
"5230",36,"panting along under heavy burdens; one husband and wife were even"
"5231",36,"carrying a small outhouse door between them, with some of their"
"5232",36,"household goods piled thereon. One man told us he meant to try to get"
"5233",36,"away from Shepperton station."
"5234",36,""
"5235",36,"There was a lot of shouting, and one man was even jesting. The idea"
"5236",36,"people seemed to have here was that the Martians were simply formidable"
"5237",36,"human beings, who might attack and sack the town, to be certainly"
"5238",36,"destroyed in the end. Every now and then people would glance nervously"
"5239",36,"across the Wey, at the meadows towards Chertsey, but everything over"
"5240",36,"there was still."
"5241",36,""
"5242",36,"Across the Thames, except just where the boats landed, everything was"
"5243",36,"quiet, in vivid contrast with the Surrey side. The people who landed"
"5244",36,"there from the boats went tramping off down the lane. The big ferryboat"
"5245",36,"had just made a journey. Three or four soldiers stood on the lawn of"
"5246",36,"the inn, staring and jesting at the fugitives, without offering to"
"5247",36,"help. The inn was closed, as it was now within prohibited hours."
"5248",36,""
"5249",36,"“What’s that?” cried a boatman, and “Shut up, you fool!” said a man"
"5250",36,"near me to a yelping dog. Then the sound came again, this time from the"
"5251",36,"direction of Chertsey, a muffled thud—the sound of a gun."
"5252",36,""
"5253",36,"The fighting was beginning. Almost immediately unseen batteries across"
"5254",36,"the river to our right, unseen because of the trees, took up the"
"5255",36,"chorus, firing heavily one after the other. A woman screamed. Everyone"
"5256",36,"stood arrested by the sudden stir of battle, near us and yet invisible"
"5257",36,"to us. Nothing was to be seen save flat meadows, cows feeding"
"5258",36,"unconcernedly for the most part, and silvery pollard willows motionless"
"5259",36,"in the warm sunlight."
"5260",36,""
"5261",36,"“The sojers’ll stop ’em,” said a woman beside me, doubtfully. A"
"5262",36,"haziness rose over the treetops."
"5263",36,""
"5264",36,"Then suddenly we saw a rush of smoke far away up the river, a puff of"
"5265",36,"smoke that jerked up into the air and hung; and forthwith the ground"
"5266",36,"heaved under foot and a heavy explosion shook the air, smashing two or"
"5267",36,"three windows in the houses near, and leaving us astonished."
"5268",36,""
"5269",36,"“Here they are!” shouted a man in a blue jersey. “Yonder! D’yer see"

"5271",36,""
"5272",36,"Quickly, one after the other, one, two, three, four of the armoured"
"5273",36,"Martians appeared, far away over the little trees, across the flat"
"5274",36,"meadows that stretched towards Chertsey, and striding hurriedly towards"
"5275",36,"the river. Little cowled figures they seemed at first, going with a"
"5276",36,"rolling motion and as fast as flying birds."
"5277",36,""
"5278",36,"Then, advancing obliquely towards us, came a fifth. Their armoured"
"5279",36,"bodies glittered in the sun as they swept swiftly forward upon the"
"5280",36,"guns, growing rapidly larger as they drew nearer. One on the extreme"
"5281",36,"left, the remotest that is, flourished a huge case high in the air, and"
"5282",36,"the ghostly, terrible Heat-Ray I had already seen on Friday night smote"
"5283",36,"towards Chertsey, and struck the town."
"5284",36,""
"5285",36,"At sight of these strange, swift, and terrible creatures the crowd near"
"5286",36,"the water’s edge seemed to me to be for a moment horror-struck. There"
"5287",36,"was no screaming or shouting, but a silence. Then a hoarse murmur and a"
"5288",36,"movement of feet—a splashing from the water. A man, too frightened to"
"5289",36,"drop the portmanteau he carried on his shoulder, swung round and sent"
"5290",36,"me staggering with a blow from the corner of his burden. A woman thrust"
"5291",36,"at me with her hand and rushed past me. I turned with the rush of the"
"5292",36,"people, but I was not too terrified for thought. The terrible Heat-Ray"
"5293",36,"was in my mind. To get under water! That was it!"
"5294",36,""
"5295",36,"“Get under water!” I shouted, unheeded."
"5296",36,""
"5297",36,"I faced about again, and rushed towards the approaching Martian, rushed"
"5298",36,"right down the gravelly beach and headlong into the water. Others did"
"5299",36,"the same. A boatload of people putting back came leaping out as I"
"5300",36,"rushed past. The stones under my feet were muddy and slippery, and the"
"5301",36,"river was so low that I ran perhaps twenty feet scarcely waist-deep."
"5302",36,"Then, as the Martian towered overhead scarcely a couple of hundred"
"5303",36,"yards away, I flung myself forward under the surface. The splashes of"
"5304",36,"the people in the boats leaping into the river sounded like"
"5305",36,"thunderclaps in my ears. People were landing hastily on both sides of"
"5306",36,"the river. But the Martian machine took no more notice for the moment"
"5307",36,"of the people running this way and that than a man would of the"
"5308",36,"confusion of ants in a nest against which his foot has kicked. When,"
"5309",36,"half suffocated, I raised my head above water, the Martian’s hood"
"5310",36,"pointed at the batteries that were still firing across the river, and"
"5311",36,"as it advanced it swung loose what must have been the generator of the"
"5312",36,"Heat-Ray."
"5313",36,""
"5314",36,"In another moment it was on the bank, and in a stride wading halfway"
"5315",36,"across. The knees of its foremost legs bent at the farther bank, and in"
"5316",36,"another moment it had raised itself to its full height again, close to"
"5317",36,"the village of Shepperton. Forthwith the six guns which, unknown to"
"5318",36,"anyone on the right bank, had been hidden behind the outskirts of that"
"5319",36,"village, fired simultaneously. The sudden near concussion, the last"
"5320",36,"close upon the first, made my heart jump. The monster was already"
"5321",36,"raising the case generating the Heat-Ray as the first shell burst six"
"5322",36,"yards above the hood."
"5323",36,""
"5324",36,"I gave a cry of astonishment. I saw and thought nothing of the other"
"5325",36,"four Martian monsters; my attention was riveted upon the nearer"
"5326",36,"incident. Simultaneously two other shells burst in the air near the"
"5327",36,"body as the hood twisted round in time to receive, but not in time to"
"5328",36,"dodge, the fourth shell."
"5329",36,""
"5330",36,"The shell burst clean in the face of the Thing. The hood bulged,"
"5331",36,"flashed, was whirled off in a dozen tattered fragments of red flesh and"
"5332",36,"glittering metal."
"5333",36,""
"5334",36,"“Hit!” shouted I, with something between a scream and a cheer."
"5335",36,""
"5336",36,"I heard answering shouts from the people in the water about me. I could"
"5337",36,"have leaped out of the water with that momentary exultation."
"5338",36,""
"5339",36,"The decapitated colossus reeled like a drunken giant; but it did not"
"5340",36,"fall over. It recovered its balance by a miracle, and, no longer"
"5341",36,"heeding its steps and with the camera that fired the Heat-Ray now"
"5342",36,"rigidly upheld, it reeled swiftly upon Shepperton. The living"
"5343",36,"intelligence, the Martian within the hood, was slain and splashed to"
"5344",36,"the four winds of heaven, and the Thing was now but a mere intricate"
"5345",36,"device of metal whirling to destruction. It drove along in a straight"
"5346",36,"line, incapable of guidance. It struck the tower of Shepperton Church,"
"5347",36,"smashing it down as the impact of a battering ram might have done,"
"5348",36,"swerved aside, blundered on and collapsed with tremendous force into"
"5349",36,"the river out of my sight."
"5350",36,""
"5351",36,"A violent explosion shook the air, and a spout of water, steam, mud,"
"5352",36,"and shattered metal shot far up into the sky. As the camera of the"
"5353",36,"Heat-Ray hit the water, the latter had immediately flashed into steam."
"5354",36,"In another moment a huge wave, like a muddy tidal bore but almost"
"5355",36,"scaldingly hot, came sweeping round the bend upstream. I saw people"
"5356",36,"struggling shorewards, and heard their screaming and shouting faintly"
"5357",36,"above the seething and roar of the Martian’s collapse."
"5358",36,""
"5359",36,"For a moment I heeded nothing of the heat, forgot the patent need of"
"5360",36,"self-preservation. I splashed through the tumultuous water, pushing"
"5361",36,"aside a man in black to do so, until I could see round the bend. Half a"
"5362",36,"dozen deserted boats pitched aimlessly upon the confusion of the waves."
"5363",36,"The fallen Martian came into sight downstream, lying across the river,"
"5364",36,"and for the most part submerged."
"5365",36,""
"5366",36,"Thick clouds of steam were pouring off the wreckage, and through the"
"5367",36,"tumultuously whirling wisps I could see, intermittently and vaguely,"
"5368",36,"the gigantic limbs churning the water and flinging a splash and spray"
"5369",36,"of mud and froth into the air. The tentacles swayed and struck like"
"5370",36,"living arms, and, save for the helpless purposelessness of these"
"5371",36,"movements, it was as if some wounded thing were struggling for its life"
"5372",36,"amid the waves. Enormous quantities of a ruddy-brown fluid were"
"5373",36,"spurting up in noisy jets out of the machine."
"5374",36,""
"5375",36,"My attention was diverted from this death flurry by a furious yelling,"
"5376",36,"like that of the thing called a siren in our manufacturing towns. A"
"5377",36,"man, knee-deep near the towing path, shouted inaudibly to me and"
"5378",36,"pointed. Looking back, I saw the other Martians advancing with gigantic"
"5379",36,"strides down the riverbank from the direction of Chertsey. The"
"5380",36,"Shepperton guns spoke this time unavailingly."
"5381",36,""
"5382",36,"At that I ducked at once under water, and, holding my breath until"
"5383",36,"movement was an agony, blundered painfully ahead under the surface as"
"5384",36,"long as I could. The water was in a tumult about me, and rapidly"
"5385",36,"growing hotter."
"5386",36,""
"5387",36,"When for a moment I raised my head to take breath and throw the hair"
"5388",36,"and water from my eyes, the steam was rising in a whirling white fog"

"5390",36,"Then I saw them dimly, colossal figures of grey, magnified by the mist."
"5391",36,"They had passed by me, and two were stooping over the frothing,"
"5392",36,"tumultuous ruins of their comrade."
"5393",36,""
"5394",36,"The third and fourth stood beside him in the water, one perhaps two"
"5395",36,"hundred yards from me, the other towards Laleham. The generators of the"
"5396",36,"Heat-Rays waved high, and the hissing beams smote down this way and"
"5397",36,"that."
"5398",36,""
"5399",36,"The air was full of sound, a deafening and confusing conflict of"
"5400",36,"noises—the clangorous din of the Martians, the crash of falling houses,"
"5401",36,"the thud of trees, fences, sheds flashing into flame, and the crackling"
"5402",36,"and roaring of fire. Dense black smoke was leaping up to mingle with"
"5403",36,"the steam from the river, and as the Heat-Ray went to and fro over"
"5404",36,"Weybridge its impact was marked by flashes of incandescent white, that"
"5405",36,"gave place at once to a smoky dance of lurid flames. The nearer houses"
"5406",36,"still stood intact, awaiting their fate, shadowy, faint and pallid in"

"5411",36,"I could see the people who had been with me in the river scrambling out"
"5412",36,"of the water through the reeds, like little frogs hurrying through"
"5413",36,"grass from the advance of a man, or running to and fro in utter dismay"
"5414",36,"on the towing path."

"5417",36,"me. The houses caved in as they dissolved at its touch, and darted out"

"5419",36,"down the towing path, licking off the people who ran this way and that,"
"5420",36,"and came down to the water’s edge not fifty yards from where I stood."

"5887",36,""
"5888",36,"Going on along the Strand to Trafalgar Square, the paper in his hand,"
"5889",36,"my brother saw some of the fugitives from West Surrey. There was a man"
"5890",36,"with his wife and two boys and some articles of furniture in a cart"
"5891",36,"such as greengrocers use. He was driving from the direction of"
"5892",36,"Westminster Bridge; and close behind him came a hay waggon with five or"
"5893",36,"six respectable-looking people in it, and some boxes and bundles. The"
"5894",36,"faces of these people were haggard, and their entire appearance"
"5895",36,"contrasted conspicuously with the Sabbath-best appearance of the people"
"5896",36,"on the omnibuses. People in fashionable clothing peeped at them out of"
"5897",36,"cabs. They stopped at the Square as if undecided which way to take, and"
"5898",36,"finally turned eastward along the Strand. Some way behind these came a"
"5899",36,"man in workday clothes, riding one of those old-fashioned tricycles"
"5900",36,"with a small front wheel. He was dirty and white in the face."
"5901",36,""
"5902",36,"My brother turned down towards Victoria, and met a number of such"
"5903",36,"people. He had a vague idea that he might see something of me. He"
"5904",36,"noticed an unusual number of police regulating the traffic. Some of the"
"5905",36,"refugees were exchanging news with the people on the omnibuses. One was"
"5906",36,"professing to have seen the Martians. “Boilers on stilts, I tell you,"
"5907",36,"striding along like men.” Most of them were excited and animated by"
"5908",36,"their strange experience."
"5909",36,""
"5910",36,"Beyond Victoria the public-houses were doing a lively trade with these"
"5911",36,"arrivals. At all the street corners groups of people were reading"
"5912",36,"papers, talking excitedly, or staring at these unusual Sunday visitors."
"5913",36,"They seemed to increase as night drew on, until at last the roads, my"
"5914",36,"brother said, were like Epsom High Street on a Derby Day. My brother"
"5915",36,"addressed several of these fugitives and got unsatisfactory answers"
"5916",36,"from most."
"5917",36,""
"5918",36,"None of them could tell him any news of Woking except one man, who"
"5919",36,"assured him that Woking had been entirely destroyed on the previous"
"5920",36,"night."

"5922",36,"“I come from Byfleet,” he said; “a man on a bicycle came through the"
"5923",36,"place in the early morning, and ran from door to door warning us to"

"5925",36,"clouds of smoke to the south—nothing but smoke, and not a soul coming"
"5926",36,"that way. Then we heard the guns at Chertsey, and folks coming from"
"5927",36,"Weybridge. So I’ve locked up my house and come on.”"
"5928",36,""
"5929",36,"At that time there was a strong feeling in the streets that the"

"5938",36,"He walked from Westminster to his apartments near Regent’s Park, about"
"5939",36,"two. He was now very anxious on my account, and disturbed at the"
"5940",36,"evident magnitude of the trouble. His mind was inclined to run, even as"
"5941",36,"mine had run on Saturday, on military details. He thought of all those"
"5942",36,"silent, expectant guns, of the suddenly nomadic countryside; he tried"
"5943",36,"to imagine “boilers on stilts” a hundred feet high."

"5948",36,"usual Sunday-night promenaders, albeit they talked in groups, and along"
"5949",36,"the edge of Regent’s Park there were as many silent couples “walking"
"5950",36,"out” together under the scattered gas lamps as ever there had been. The"
"5951",36,"night was warm and still, and a little oppressive; the sound of guns"

"5958",36,"went to bed a little after midnight, and was awakened from lurid dreams"
"5959",36,"in the small hours of Monday by the sound of door knockers, feet"
"5960",36,"running in the street, distant drumming, and a clamour of bells. Red"
"5961",36,"reflections danced on the ceiling. For a moment he lay astonished,"
"5962",36,"wondering whether day had come or the world gone mad. Then he jumped"

"5968",36,"shouted. “They are coming!” bawled a policeman, hammering at the door;"
"5969",36,"“the Martians are coming!” and hurried to the next door."

"5973",36,"sleep with a vehement disorderly tocsin. There was a noise of doors"
"5974",36,"opening, and window after window in the houses opposite flashed from"
"5975",36,"darkness into yellow illumination."

"5977",36,"Up the street came galloping a closed carriage, bursting abruptly into"
"5978",36,"noise at the corner, rising to a clattering climax under the window,"

"5980",36,"couple of cabs, the forerunners of a long procession of flying"
"5981",36,"vehicles, going for the most part to Chalk Farm station, where the"

"5988",36,"opened, and the man who lodged across the landing came in, dressed only"

"6015",36,"windows to stare out and ask aimless questions, dressing hastily as the"
"6016",36,"first breath of the coming storm of Fear blew through the streets. It"
"6017",36,"was the dawn of the great panic. London, which had gone to bed on"
"6018",36,"Sunday night oblivious and inert, was awakened, in the small hours of"
"6019",36,"Monday morning, to a vivid sense of danger."

"6022",36,"down and out into the street, just as the sky between the parapets of"
"6023",36,"the houses grew pink with the early dawn. The flying people on foot and"
"6024",36,"in vehicles grew more numerous every moment. “Black Smoke!” he heard"
"6025",36,"people crying, and again “Black Smoke!” The contagion of such a"
"6026",36,"unanimous fear was inevitable. As my brother hesitated on the"
"6027",36,"door-step, he saw another newsvendor approaching, and got a paper"
"6028",36,"forthwith. The man was running away with the rest, and selling his"
"6029",36,"papers for a shilling each as he ran—a grotesque mingling of profit and"
"6030",36,"panic."

"6038",36,"advancing slowly towards London, destroying everything on the way. It"
"6039",36,"is impossible to stop them. There is no safety from the Black Smoke but"
"6040",36,"in instant flight.”"

"6042",36,""
"6043",36,"That was all, but it was enough. The whole population of the great"
"6044",36,"six-million city was stirring, slipping, running; presently it would be"
"6045",36,"pouring _en masse_ northward."
"6046",36,""
"6047",36,"“Black Smoke!” the voices cried. “Fire!”"

"6050",36,"carelessly driven smashed, amid shrieks and curses, against the water"
"6051",36,"trough up the street. Sickly yellow lights went to and fro in the"
"6052",36,"houses, and some of the passing cabs flaunted unextinguished lamps. And"

"6072",36,"hedge in the flat meadows near Halliford, and while my brother was"
"6073",36,"watching the fugitives stream over Westminster Bridge, that the"
"6074",36,"Martians had resumed the offensive. So far as one can ascertain from"
"6075",36,"the conflicting accounts that have been put forth, the majority of them"
"6076",36,"remained busied with preparations in the Horsell pit until nine that"
"6077",36,"night, hurrying on some operation that disengaged huge volumes of green"
"6078",36,"smoke."
"6079",36,""
"6080",36,"But three certainly came out about eight o’clock and, advancing slowly"
"6081",36,"and cautiously, made their way through Byfleet and Pyrford towards"
"6082",36,"Ripley and Weybridge, and so came in sight of the expectant batteries"
"6083",36,"against the setting sun. These Martians did not advance in a body, but"
"6084",36,"in a line, each perhaps a mile and a half from his nearest fellow. They"
"6085",36,"communicated with one another by means of sirenlike howls, running up"
"6086",36,"and down the scale from one note to another."
"6087",36,""
"6088",36,"It was this howling and firing of the guns at Ripley and St. George’s"
"6089",36,"Hill that we had heard at Upper Halliford. The Ripley gunners,"
"6090",36,"unseasoned artillery volunteers who ought never to have been placed in"
"6091",36,"such a position, fired one wild, premature, ineffectual volley, and"
"6092",36,"bolted on horse and foot through the deserted village, while the"
"6093",36,"Martian, without using his Heat-Ray, walked serenely over their guns,"
"6094",36,"stepped gingerly among them, passed in front of them, and so came"
"6095",36,"unexpectedly upon the guns in Painshill Park, which he destroyed."
"6096",36,""
"6097",36,"The St. George’s Hill men, however, were better led or of a better"
"6098",36,"mettle. Hidden by a pine wood as they were, they seem to have been"
"6099",36,"quite unsuspected by the Martian nearest to them. They laid their guns"
"6100",36,"as deliberately as if they had been on parade, and fired at about a"
"6101",36,"thousand yards’ range."
"6102",36,""
"6103",36,"The shells flashed all round him, and he was seen to advance a few"
"6104",36,"paces, stagger, and go down. Everybody yelled together, and the guns"
"6105",36,"were reloaded in frantic haste. The overthrown Martian set up a"
"6106",36,"prolonged ululation, and immediately a second glittering giant,"
"6107",36,"answering him, appeared over the trees to the south. It would seem that"
"6108",36,"a leg of the tripod had been smashed by one of the shells. The whole of"
"6109",36,"the second volley flew wide of the Martian on the ground, and,"
"6110",36,"simultaneously, both his companions brought their Heat-Rays to bear on"
"6111",36,"the battery. The ammunition blew up, the pine trees all about the guns"
"6112",36,"flashed into fire, and only one or two of the men who were already"
"6113",36,"running over the crest of the hill escaped."
"6114",36,""
"6115",36,"After this it would seem that the three took counsel together and"
"6116",36,"halted, and the scouts who were watching them report that they remained"
"6117",36,"absolutely stationary for the next half hour. The Martian who had been"
"6118",36,"overthrown crawled tediously out of his hood, a small brown figure,"
"6119",36,"oddly suggestive from that distance of a speck of blight, and"
"6120",36,"apparently engaged in the repair of his support. About nine he had"
"6121",36,"finished, for his cowl was then seen above the trees again."
"6122",36,""
"6123",36,"It was a few minutes past nine that night when these three sentinels"

"6126",36,"to distribute themselves at equal distances along a curved line between"
"6127",36,"St. George’s Hill, Weybridge, and the village of Send, southwest of"
"6128",36,"Ripley."

"6133",36,"tubes, crossed the river, and two of them, black against the western"
"6134",36,"sky, came into sight of myself and the curate as we hurried wearily and"
"6135",36,"painfully along the road that runs northward out of Halliford. They"
"6136",36,"moved, as it seemed to us, upon a cloud, for a milky mist covered the"
"6137",36,"fields and rose to a third of their height."
"6138",36,""
"6139",36,"At this sight the curate cried faintly in his throat, and began"
"6140",36,"running; but I knew it was no good running from a Martian, and I turned"
"6141",36,"aside and crawled through dewy nettles and brambles into the broad"
"6142",36,"ditch by the side of the road. He looked back, saw what I was doing,"
"6143",36,"and turned to join me."
"6144",36,""
"6145",36,"The two halted, the nearer to us standing and facing Sunbury, the"
"6146",36,"remoter being a grey indistinctness towards the evening star, away"

"6149",36,"The occasional howling of the Martians had ceased; they took up their"
"6150",36,"positions in the huge crescent about their cylinders in absolute"
"6151",36,"silence. It was a crescent with twelve miles between its horns. Never"
"6152",36,"since the devising of gunpowder was the beginning of a battle so still."
"6153",36,"To us and to an observer about Ripley it would have had precisely the"
"6154",36,"same effect—the Martians seemed in solitary possession of the darkling"
"6155",36,"night, lit only as it was by the slender moon, the stars, the afterglow"
"6156",36,"of the daylight, and the ruddy glare from St. George’s Hill and the"
"6157",36,"woods of Painshill."

"6159",36,"But facing that crescent everywhere—at Staines, Hounslow, Ditton,"
"6160",36,"Esher, Ockham, behind hills and woods south of the river, and across"
"6161",36,"the flat grass meadows to the north of it, wherever a cluster of trees"
"6162",36,"or village houses gave sufficient cover—the guns were waiting. The"
"6163",36,"signal rockets burst and rained their sparks through the night and"
"6164",36,"vanished, and the spirit of all those watching batteries rose to a"
"6165",36,"tense expectation. The Martians had but to advance into the line of"
"6166",36,"fire, and instantly those motionless black forms of men, those guns"
"6167",36,"glittering so darkly in the early night, would explode into a"
"6168",36,"thunderous fury of battle."
"6169",36,""
"6170",36,"No doubt the thought that was uppermost in a thousand of those vigilant"
"6171",36,"minds, even as it was uppermost in mine, was the riddle—how much they"
"6172",36,"understood of us. Did they grasp that we in our millions were"
"6173",36,"organized, disciplined, working together? Or did they interpret our"
"6174",36,"spurts of fire, the sudden stinging of our shells, our steady"
"6175",36,"investment of their encampment, as we should the furious unanimity of"
"6176",36,"onslaught in a disturbed hive of bees? Did they dream they might"
"6177",36,"exterminate us? (At that time no one knew what food they needed.) A"
"6178",36,"hundred such questions struggled together in my mind as I watched that"
"6179",36,"vast sentinel shape. And in the back of my mind was the sense of all"
"6180",36,"the huge unknown and hidden forces Londonward. Had they prepared"
"6181",36,"pitfalls? Were the powder mills at Hounslow ready as a snare? Would the"
"6182",36,"Londoners have the heart and courage to make a greater Moscow of their"
"6183",36,"mighty province of houses?"
"6184",36,""
"6185",36,"Then, after an interminable time, as it seemed to us, crouching and"
"6186",36,"peering through the hedge, came a sound like the distant concussion of"
"6187",36,"a gun. Another nearer, and then another. And then the Martian beside us"
"6188",36,"raised his tube on high and discharged it, gunwise, with a heavy report"
"6189",36,"that made the ground heave. The one towards Staines answered him. There"
"6190",36,"was no flash, no smoke, simply that loaded detonation."
"6191",36,""
"6192",36,"I was so excited by these heavy minute-guns following one another that"
"6193",36,"I so far forgot my personal safety and my scalded hands as to clamber"
"6194",36,"up into the hedge and stare towards Sunbury. As I did so a second"
"6195",36,"report followed, and a big projectile hurtled overhead towards"
"6196",36,"Hounslow. I expected at least to see smoke or fire, or some such"
"6197",36,"evidence of its work. But all I saw was the deep blue sky above, with"
"6198",36,"one solitary star, and the white mist spreading wide and low beneath."
"6199",36,"And there had been no crash, no answering explosion. The silence was"
"6200",36,"restored; the minute lengthened to three."

"6212",36,"smaller as he receded, and presently the mist and the gathering night"
"6213",36,"had swallowed him up. By a common impulse we clambered higher. Towards"
"6214",36,"Sunbury was a dark appearance, as though a conical hill had suddenly"
"6215",36,"come into being there, hiding our view of the farther country; and"
"6216",36,"then, remoter across the river, over Walton, we saw another such"
"6217",36,"summit. These hill-like forms grew lower and broader even as we stared."

"6225",36,"the earthly artillery made no reply."
"6226",36,""
"6227",36,"Now at the time we could not understand these things, but later I was"
"6228",36,"to learn the meaning of these ominous kopjes that gathered in the"
"6229",36,"twilight. Each of the Martians, standing in the great crescent I have"
"6230",36,"described, had discharged, by means of the gunlike tube he carried, a"
"6231",36,"huge canister over whatever hill, copse, cluster of houses, or other"
"6232",36,"possible cover for guns, chanced to be in front of him. Some fired only"
"6233",36,"one of these, some two—as in the case of the one we had seen; the one"
"6234",36,"at Ripley is said to have discharged no fewer than five at that time."
"6235",36,"These canisters smashed on striking the ground—they did not explode—and"
"6236",36,"incontinently disengaged an enormous volume of heavy, inky vapour,"
"6237",36,"coiling and pouring upward in a huge and ebony cumulus cloud, a gaseous"
"6238",36,"hill that sank and spread itself slowly over the surrounding country."
"6239",36,"And the touch of that vapour, the inhaling of its pungent wisps, was"
"6240",36,"death to all that breathes."
"6241",36,""
"6242",36,"It was heavy, this vapour, heavier than the densest smoke, so that,"
"6243",36,"after the first tumultuous uprush and outflow of its impact, it sank"
"6244",36,"down through the air and poured over the ground in a manner rather"
"6245",36,"liquid than gaseous, abandoning the hills, and streaming into the"
"6246",36,"valleys and ditches and watercourses even as I have heard the"
"6247",36,"carbonic-acid gas that pours from volcanic clefts is wont to do. And"
"6248",36,"where it came upon water some chemical action occurred, and the surface"
"6249",36,"would be instantly covered with a powdery scum that sank slowly and"
"6250",36,"made way for more. The scum was absolutely insoluble, and it is a"
"6251",36,"strange thing, seeing the instant effect of the gas, that one could"
"6252",36,"drink without hurt the water from which it had been strained. The"
"6253",36,"vapour did not diffuse as a true gas would do. It hung together in"
"6254",36,"banks, flowing sluggishly down the slope of the land and driving"
"6255",36,"reluctantly before the wind, and very slowly it combined with the mist"
"6256",36,"and moisture of the air, and sank to the earth in the form of dust."
"6257",36,"Save that an unknown element giving a group of four lines in the blue"
"6258",36,"of the spectrum is concerned, we are still entirely ignorant of the"
"6259",36,"nature of this substance."
"6260",36,""
"6261",36,"Once the tumultuous upheaval of its dispersion was over, the black"
"6262",36,"smoke clung so closely to the ground, even before its precipitation,"
"6263",36,"that fifty feet up in the air, on the roofs and upper stories of high"
"6264",36,"houses and on great trees, there was a chance of escaping its poison"
"6265",36,"altogether, as was proved even that night at Street Cobham and Ditton."
"6266",36,""
"6267",36,"The man who escaped at the former place tells a wonderful story of the"
"6268",36,"strangeness of its coiling flow, and how he looked down from the church"
"6269",36,"spire and saw the houses of the village rising like ghosts out of its"
"6270",36,"inky nothingness. For a day and a half he remained there, weary,"
"6271",36,"starving and sun-scorched, the earth under the blue sky and against the"
"6272",36,"prospect of the distant hills a velvet-black expanse, with red roofs,"
"6273",36,"green trees, and, later, black-veiled shrubs and gates, barns,"
"6274",36,"outhouses, and walls, rising here and there into the sunlight."
"6275",36,""
"6276",36,"But that was at Street Cobham, where the black vapour was allowed to"
"6277",36,"remain until it sank of its own accord into the ground. As a rule the"
"6278",36,"Martians, when it had served its purpose, cleared the air of it again"
"6279",36,"by wading into it and directing a jet of steam upon it."
"6280",36,""
"6281",36,"This they did with the vapour banks near us, as we saw in the starlight"
"6282",36,"from the window of a deserted house at Upper Halliford, whither we had"
"6283",36,"returned. From there we could see the searchlights on Richmond Hill and"
"6284",36,"Kingston Hill going to and fro, and about eleven the windows rattled,"
"6285",36,"and we heard the sound of the huge siege guns that had been put in"
"6286",36,"position there. These continued intermittently for the space of a"
"6287",36,"quarter of an hour, sending chance shots at the invisible Martians at"
"6288",36,"Hampton and Ditton, and then the pale beams of the electric light"
"6289",36,"vanished, and were replaced by a bright red glow."
"6290",36,""
"6291",36,"Then the fourth cylinder fell—a brilliant green meteor—as I learned"
"6292",36,"afterwards, in Bushey Park. Before the guns on the Richmond and"
"6293",36,"Kingston line of hills began, there was a fitful cannonade far away in"
"6294",36,"the southwest, due, I believe, to guns being fired haphazard before the"
"6295",36,"black vapour could overwhelm the gunners."
"6296",36,""
"6297",36,"So, setting about it as methodically as men might smoke out a wasps’"

"6299",36,"Londonward country. The horns of the crescent slowly moved apart, until"
"6300",36,"at last they formed a line from Hanwell to Coombe and Malden. All night"
"6301",36,"through their destructive tubes advanced. Never once, after the Martian"
"6302",36,"at St. George’s Hill was brought down, did they give the artillery the"
"6303",36,"ghost of a chance against them. Wherever there was a possibility of"
"6304",36,"guns being laid for them unseen, a fresh canister of the black vapour"
"6305",36,"was discharged, and where the guns were openly displayed the Heat-Ray"
"6306",36,"was brought to bear."
"6307",36,""
"6308",36,"By midnight the blazing trees along the slopes of Richmond Park and the"
"6309",36,"glare of Kingston Hill threw their light upon a network of black smoke,"
"6310",36,"blotting out the whole valley of the Thames and extending as far as the"
"6311",36,"eye could reach. And through this two Martians slowly waded, and turned"
"6312",36,"their hissing steam jets this way and that."
"6313",36,""
"6314",36,"They were sparing of the Heat-Ray that night, either because they had"
"6315",36,"but a limited supply of material for its production or because they did"
"6316",36,"not wish to destroy the country but only to crush and overawe the"
"6317",36,"opposition they had aroused. In the latter aim they certainly"
"6318",36,"succeeded. Sunday night was the end of the organised opposition to"
"6319",36,"their movements. After that no body of men would stand against them, so"
"6320",36,"hopeless was the enterprise. Even the crews of the torpedo-boats and"
"6321",36,"destroyers that had brought their quick-firers up the Thames refused to"
"6322",36,"stop, mutinied, and went down again. The only offensive operation men"
"6323",36,"ventured upon after that night was the preparation of mines and"
"6324",36,"pitfalls, and even in that their energies were frantic and spasmodic."
"6325",36,""
"6326",36,"One has to imagine, as well as one may, the fate of those batteries"

"6329",36,"watchful, the gunners ready, the ammunition piled to hand, the limber"
"6330",36,"gunners with their horses and waggons, the groups of civilian"
"6331",36,"spectators standing as near as they were permitted, the evening"
"6332",36,"stillness, the ambulances and hospital tents with the burned and"
"6333",36,"wounded from Weybridge; then the dull resonance of the shots the"
"6334",36,"Martians fired, and the clumsy projectile whirling over the trees and"

"6340",36,"strange and horrible antagonist of vapour striding upon its victims,"

"6361",36,"flight rising swiftly to a torrent, lashing in a foaming tumult round"
"6362",36,"the railway stations, banked up into a horrible struggle about the"
"6363",36,"shipping in the Thames, and hurrying by every available channel"
"6364",36,"northward and eastward. By ten o’clock the police organisation, and by"
"6365",36,"midday even the railway organisations, were losing coherency, losing"
"6366",36,"shape and efficiency, guttering, softening, running at last in that"

"6381",36,"ever-thickening multitude away from the stations and along the"
"6382",36,"northward-running roads. By midday a Martian had been seen at Barnes,"
"6383",36,"and a cloud of slowly sinking black vapour drove along the Thames and"
"6384",36,"across the flats of Lambeth, cutting off all escape over the bridges in"
"6385",36,"its sluggish advance. Another bank drove over Ealing, and surrounded a"
"6386",36,"little island of survivors on Castle Hill, alive, but unable to escape."

"6403",36,"wondering. He was passed by a number of cyclists, some horsemen, and"
"6404",36,"two motor cars. A mile from Edgware the rim of the wheel broke, and the"
"6405",36,"machine became unridable. He left it by the roadside and trudged"
"6406",36,"through the village. There were shops half opened in the main street of"
"6407",36,"the place, and people crowded on the pavement and in the doorways and"
"6408",36,"windows, staring astonished at this extraordinary procession of"
"6409",36,"fugitives that was beginning. He succeeded in getting some food at an"

"6412",36,"For a time he remained in Edgware not knowing what next to do. The"
"6413",36,"flying people increased in number. Many of them, like my brother,"

"6420",36,"dust hung in heavy clouds along the road to St. Albans."
"6421",36,""
"6422",36,"It was perhaps a vague idea of making his way to Chelmsford, where some"
"6423",36,"friends of his lived, that at last induced my brother to strike into a"
"6424",36,"quiet lane running eastward. Presently he came upon a stile, and,"
"6425",36,"crossing it, followed a footpath northeastward. He passed near several"
"6426",36,"farmhouses and some little places whose names he did not learn. He saw"
"6427",36,"few fugitives until, in a grass lane towards High Barnet, he happened"
"6428",36,"upon two ladies who became his fellow travellers. He came upon them"

"6447",36,"across his face, a third antagonist struck him between the eyes, and"
"6448",36,"the man he held wrenched himself free and made off down the lane in the"

"6498",36,"under the seat—luckily for my brother—and told them to drive on to"
"6499",36,"Edgware, with the idea of getting a train there. He stopped behind to"
"6500",36,"tell the neighbours. He would overtake them, he said, at about half"
"6501",36,"past four in the morning, and now it was nearly nine and they had seen"
"6502",36,"nothing of him. They could not stop in Edgware because of the growing"
"6503",36,"traffic through the place, and so they had come into this side lane."
"6504",36,""
"6505",36,"That was the story they told my brother in fragments when presently"

"6507",36,"them, at least until they could determine what to do, or until the"
"6508",36,"missing man arrived, and professed to be an expert shot with the"
"6509",36,"revolver—a weapon strange to him—in order to give them confidence."
"6510",36,""
"6511",36,"They made a sort of encampment by the wayside, and the pony became"
"6512",36,"happy in the hedge. He told them of his own escape out of London, and"

"6514",36,"in the sky, and after a time their talk died out and gave place to an"
"6515",36,"uneasy state of anticipation. Several wayfarers came along the lane,"

"6585",36,"within twenty feet of the ground grey and indistinct and was"
"6586",36,"perpetually renewed by the hurrying feet of a dense crowd of horses and"
"6587",36,"of men and women on foot, and by the wheels of vehicles of every"
"6588",36,"description."
"6589",36,""
"6590",36,"“Way!” my brother heard voices crying. “Make way!”"
"6591",36,""
"6592",36,"It was like riding into the smoke of a fire to approach the meeting"
"6593",36,"point of the lane and road; the crowd roared like a fire, and the dust"
"6594",36,"was hot and pungent. And, indeed, a little way up the road a villa was"
"6595",36,"burning and sending rolling masses of black smoke across the road to"
"6596",36,"add to the confusion."
"6597",36,""
"6598",36,"Two men came past them. Then a dirty woman, carrying a heavy bundle and"
"6599",36,"weeping. A lost retriever dog, with hanging tongue, circled dubiously"
"6600",36,"round them, scared and wretched, and fled at my brother’s threat."
"6601",36,""
"6602",36,"So much as they could see of the road Londonward between the houses to"
"6603",36,"the right was a tumultuous stream of dirty, hurrying people, pent in"
"6604",36,"between the villas on either side; the black heads, the crowded forms,"
"6605",36,"grew into distinctness as they rushed towards the corner, hurried past,"
"6606",36,"and merged their individuality again in a receding multitude that was"
"6607",36,"swallowed up at last in a cloud of dust."
"6608",36,""
"6609",36,"“Go on! Go on!” cried the voices. “Way! Way!”"

"6611",36,"One man’s hands pressed on the back of another. My brother stood at the"
"6612",36,"pony’s head. Irresistibly attracted, he advanced slowly, pace by pace,"
"6613",36,"down the lane."
"6614",36,""
"6615",36,"Edgware had been a scene of confusion, Chalk Farm a riotous tumult, but"
"6616",36,"this was a whole population in movement. It is hard to imagine that"
"6617",36,"host. It had no character of its own. The figures poured out past the"
"6618",36,"corner, and receded with their backs to the group in the lane. Along"
"6619",36,"the margin came those who were on foot threatened by the wheels,"
"6620",36,"stumbling in the ditches, blundering into one another."
"6621",36,""
"6622",36,"The carts and carriages crowded close upon one another, making little"
"6623",36,"way for those swifter and more impatient vehicles that darted forward"
"6624",36,"every now and then when an opportunity showed itself of doing so,"
"6625",36,"sending the people scattering against the fences and gates of the"
"6626",36,"villas."

"6628",36,"“Push on!” was the cry. “Push on! They are coming!”"

"6630",36,"In one cart stood a blind man in the uniform of the Salvation Army,"
"6631",36,"gesticulating with his crooked fingers and bawling, “Eternity!"
"6632",36,"Eternity!” His voice was hoarse and very loud so that my brother could"
"6633",36,"hear him long after he was lost to sight in the dust. Some of the"
"6634",36,"people who crowded in the carts whipped stupidly at their horses and"
"6635",36,"quarrelled with other drivers; some sat motionless, staring at nothing"
"6636",36,"with miserable eyes; some gnawed their hands with thirst, or lay"
"6637",36,"prostrate in the bottoms of their conveyances. The horses’ bits were"
"6638",36,"covered with foam, their eyes bloodshot."
"6639",36,""
"6640",36,"There were cabs, carriages, shop-carts, waggons, beyond counting; a"
"6641",36,"mail cart, a road-cleaner’s cart marked “Vestry of St. Pancras,” a huge"
"6642",36,"timber waggon crowded with roughs. A brewer’s dray rumbled by with its"
"6643",36,"two near wheels splashed with fresh blood."

"6645",36,"“Clear the way!” cried the voices. “Clear the way!”"

"6647",36,"“Eter-nity! Eter-nity!” came echoing down the road."
"6648",36,""
"6649",36,"There were sad, haggard women tramping by, well dressed, with children"
"6650",36,"that cried and stumbled, their dainty clothes smothered in dust, their"
"6651",36,"weary faces smeared with tears. With many of these came men, sometimes"
"6652",36,"helpful, sometimes lowering and savage. Fighting side by side with them"
"6653",36,"pushed some weary street outcast in faded black rags, wide-eyed,"
"6654",36,"loud-voiced, and foul-mouthed. There were sturdy workmen thrusting"
"6655",36,"their way along, wretched, unkempt men, clothed like clerks or shopmen,"
"6656",36,"struggling spasmodically; a wounded soldier my brother noticed, men"
"6657",36,"dressed in the clothes of railway porters, one wretched creature in a"
"6658",36,"nightshirt with a coat thrown over it."
"6659",36,""
"6660",36,"But varied as its composition was, certain things all that host had in"
"6661",36,"common. There were fear and pain on their faces, and fear behind them."
"6662",36,"A tumult up the road, a quarrel for a place in a waggon, sent the whole"
"6663",36,"host of them quickening their pace; even a man so scared and broken"
"6664",36,"that his knees bent under him was galvanised for a moment into renewed"
"6665",36,"activity. The heat and dust had already been at work upon this"
"6666",36,"multitude. Their skins were dry, their lips black and cracked. They"
"6667",36,"were all thirsty, weary, and footsore. And amid the various cries one"
"6668",36,"heard disputes, reproaches, groans of weariness and fatigue; the voices"
"6669",36,"of most of them were hoarse and weak. Through it all ran a refrain:"
"6670",36,""
"6671",36,"“Way! Way! The Martians are coming!”"
"6672",36,""
"6673",36,"Few stopped and came aside from that flood. The lane opened slantingly"
"6674",36,"into the main road with a narrow opening, and had a delusive appearance"
"6675",36,"of coming from the direction of London. Yet a kind of eddy of people"
"6676",36,"drove into its mouth; weaklings elbowed out of the stream, who for the"
"6677",36,"most part rested but a moment before plunging into it again. A little"
"6678",36,"way down the lane, with two friends bending over him, lay a man with a"
"6679",36,"bare leg, wrapped about with bloody rags. He was a lucky man to have"
"6680",36,"friends."
"6681",36,""
"6682",36,"A little old man, with a grey military moustache and a filthy black"
"6683",36,"frock coat, limped out and sat down beside the trap, removed his"
"6684",36,"boot—his sock was blood-stained—shook out a pebble, and hobbled on"
"6685",36,"again; and then a little girl of eight or nine, all alone, threw"
"6686",36,"herself under the hedge close by my brother, weeping."

"6690",36,"My brother woke from his torpor of astonishment and lifted her up,"
"6691",36,"speaking gently to her, and carried her to Miss Elphinstone. So soon as"
"6692",36,"my brother touched her she became quite still, as if frightened."
"6693",36,""
"6694",36,"“Ellen!” shrieked a woman in the crowd, with tears in her"
"6695",36,"voice—“Ellen!” And the child suddenly darted away from my brother,"
"6696",36,"crying “Mother!”"
"6697",36,""
"6698",36,"“They are coming,” said a man on horseback, riding past along the lane."
"6699",36,""
"6700",36,"“Out of the way, there!” bawled a coachman, towering high; and my"
"6701",36,"brother saw a closed carriage turning into the lane."
"6702",36,""
"6703",36,"The people crushed back on one another to avoid the horse. My brother"
"6704",36,"pushed the pony and chaise back into the hedge, and the man drove by"
"6705",36,"and stopped at the turn of the way. It was a carriage, with a pole for"
"6706",36,"a pair of horses, but only one was in the traces. My brother saw dimly"
"6707",36,"through the dust that two men lifted out something on a white stretcher"
"6708",36,"and put it gently on the grass beneath the privet hedge."
"6709",36,""
"6710",36,"One of the men came running to my brother."
"6711",36,""
"6712",36,"“Where is there any water?” he said. “He is dying fast, and very"
"6713",36,"thirsty. It is Lord Garrick.”"

"6715",36,"“Lord Garrick!” said my brother; “the Chief Justice?”"
"6716",36,""
"6717",36,"“The water?” he said."
"6718",36,""
"6719",36,"“There may be a tap,” said my brother, “in some of the houses. We have"
"6720",36,"no water. I dare not leave my people.”"
"6721",36,""
"6722",36,"The man pushed against the crowd towards the gate of the corner house."

"6724",36,"“Go on!” said the people, thrusting at him. “They are coming! Go on!”"
"6725",36,""
"6726",36,"Then my brother’s attention was distracted by a bearded, eagle-faced"
"6727",36,"man lugging a small handbag, which split even as my brother’s eyes"
"6728",36,"rested on it and disgorged a mass of sovereigns that seemed to break up"
"6729",36,"into separate coins as it struck the ground. They rolled hither and"
"6730",36,"thither among the struggling feet of men and horses. The man stopped"
"6731",36,"and looked stupidly at the heap, and the shaft of a cab struck his"
"6732",36,"shoulder and sent him reeling. He gave a shriek and dodged back, and a"
"6733",36,"cartwheel shaved him narrowly."
"6734",36,""
"6735",36,"“Way!” cried the men all about him. “Make way!”"
"6736",36,""
"6737",36,"So soon as the cab had passed, he flung himself, with both hands open,"
"6738",36,"upon the heap of coins, and began thrusting handfuls in his pocket. A"
"6739",36,"horse rose close upon him, and in another moment, half rising, he had"
"6740",36,"been borne down under the horse’s hoofs."
"6741",36,""
"6742",36,"“Stop!” screamed my brother, and pushing a woman out of his way, tried"
"6743",36,"to clutch the bit of the horse."
"6744",36,""
"6745",36,"Before he could get to it, he heard a scream under the wheels, and saw"
"6746",36,"through the dust the rim passing over the poor wretch’s back. The"
"6747",36,"driver of the cart slashed his whip at my brother, who ran round behind"
"6748",36,"the cart. The multitudinous shouting confused his ears. The man was"
"6749",36,"writhing in the dust among his scattered money, unable to rise, for the"
"6750",36,"wheel had broken his back, and his lower limbs lay limp and dead. My"
"6751",36,"brother stood up and yelled at the next driver, and a man on a black"
"6752",36,"horse came to his assistance."
"6753",36,""
"6754",36,"“Get him out of the road,” said he; and, clutching the man’s collar"
"6755",36,"with his free hand, my brother lugged him sideways. But he still"
"6756",36,"clutched after his money, and regarded my brother fiercely, hammering"
"6757",36,"at his arm with a handful of gold. “Go on! Go on!” shouted angry voices"
"6758",36,"behind. “Way! Way!”"
"6759",36,""
"6760",36,"There was a smash as the pole of a carriage crashed into the cart that"
"6761",36,"the man on horseback stopped. My brother looked up, and the man with"
"6762",36,"the gold twisted his head round and bit the wrist that held his collar."
"6763",36,"There was a concussion, and the black horse came staggering sideways,"
"6764",36,"and the carthorse pushed beside it. A hoof missed my brother’s foot by"
"6765",36,"a hair’s breadth. He released his grip on the fallen man and jumped"
"6766",36,"back. He saw anger change to terror on the face of the poor wretch on"
"6767",36,"the ground, and in a moment he was hidden and my brother was borne"
"6768",36,"backward and carried past the entrance of the lane, and had to fight"
"6769",36,"hard in the torrent to recover it."
"6770",36,""
"6771",36,"He saw Miss Elphinstone covering her eyes, and a little child, with all"
"6772",36,"a child’s want of sympathetic imagination, staring with dilated eyes at"
"6773",36,"a dusty something that lay black and still, ground and crushed under"
"6774",36,"the rolling wheels. “Let us go back!” he shouted, and began turning the"
"6775",36,"pony round. “We cannot cross this—hell,” he said and they went back a"
"6776",36,"hundred yards the way they had come, until the fighting crowd was"
"6777",36,"hidden. As they passed the bend in the lane my brother saw the face of"
"6778",36,"the dying man in the ditch under the privet, deadly white and drawn,"
"6779",36,"and shining with perspiration. The two women sat silent, crouching in"
"6780",36,"their seat and shivering."
"6781",36,""
"6782",36,"Then beyond the bend my brother stopped again. Miss Elphinstone was"
"6783",36,"white and pale, and her sister-in-law sat weeping, too wretched even to"
"6784",36,"call upon “George.” My brother was horrified and perplexed. So soon as"
"6785",36,"they had retreated he realised how urgent and unavoidable it was to"
"6786",36,"attempt this crossing. He turned to Miss Elphinstone, suddenly"
"6787",36,"resolute."
"6788",36,""
"6789",36,"“We must go that way,” he said, and led the pony round again."
"6790",36,""
"6791",36,"For the second time that day this girl proved her quality. To force"
"6792",36,"their way into the torrent of people, my brother plunged into the"
"6793",36,"traffic and held back a cab horse, while she drove the pony across its"
"6794",36,"head. A waggon locked wheels for a moment and ripped a long splinter"
"6795",36,"from the chaise. In another moment they were caught and swept forward"
"6796",36,"by the stream. My brother, with the cabman’s whip marks red across his"
"6797",36,"face and hands, scrambled into the chaise and took the reins from her."
"6798",36,""
"6799",36,"“Point the revolver at the man behind,” he said, giving it to her, “if"
"6800",36,"he presses us too hard. No!—point it at his horse.”"
"6801",36,""
"6802",36,"Then he began to look out for a chance of edging to the right across"
"6803",36,"the road. But once in the stream he seemed to lose volition, to become"
"6804",36,"a part of that dusty rout. They swept through Chipping Barnet with the"
"6805",36,"torrent; they were nearly a mile beyond the centre of the town before"
"6806",36,"they had fought across to the opposite side of the way. It was din and"
"6807",36,"confusion indescribable; but in and beyond the town the road forks"
"6808",36,"repeatedly, and this to some extent relieved the stress."
"6809",36,""
"6810",36,"They struck eastward through Hadley, and there on either side of the"
"6811",36,"road, and at another place farther on they came upon a great multitude"
"6812",36,"of people drinking at the stream, some fighting to come at the water."
"6813",36,"And farther on, from a lull near East Barnet, they saw two trains"
"6814",36,"running slowly one after the other without signal or order—trains"
"6815",36,"swarming with people, with men even among the coals behind the"
"6816",36,"engines—going northward along the Great Northern Railway. My brother"
"6817",36,"supposes they must have filled outside London, for at that time the"
"6818",36,"furious terror of the people had rendered the central termini"
"6819",36,"impossible."
"6820",36,""
"6821",36,"Near this place they halted for the rest of the afternoon, for the"
"6822",36,"violence of the day had already utterly exhausted all three of them."
"6823",36,"They began to suffer the beginnings of hunger; the night was cold, and"
"6824",36,"none of them dared to sleep. And in the evening many people came"
"6825",36,"hurrying along the road nearby their stopping place, fleeing from"
"6826",36,"unknown dangers before them, and going in the direction from which my"
"6827",36,"brother had come."

"6836",36,"Had the Martians aimed only at destruction, they might on Monday have"
"6837",36,"annihilated the entire population of London, as it spread itself slowly"
"6838",36,"through the home counties. Not only along the road through Barnet, but"
"6839",36,"also through Edgware and Waltham Abbey, and along the roads eastward to"
"6840",36,"Southend and Shoeburyness, and south of the Thames to Deal and"
"6841",36,"Broadstairs, poured the same frantic rout. If one could have hung that"
"6842",36,"June morning in a balloon in the blazing blue above London every"
"6843",36,"northward and eastward road running out of the tangled maze of streets"
"6844",36,"would have seemed stippled black with the streaming fugitives, each dot"
"6845",36,"a human agony of terror and physical distress. I have set forth at"
"6846",36,"length in the last chapter my brother’s account of the road through"
"6847",36,"Chipping Barnet, in order that my readers may realise how that swarming"
"6848",36,"of black dots appeared to one of those concerned. Never before in the"
"6849",36,"history of the world had such a mass of human beings moved and suffered"
"6850",36,"together. The legendary hosts of Goths and Huns, the hugest armies Asia"
"6851",36,"has ever seen, would have been but a drop in that current. And this was"
"6852",36,"no disciplined march; it was a stampede—a stampede gigantic and"
"6853",36,"terrible—without order and without a goal, six million people unarmed"
"6854",36,"and unprovisioned, driving headlong. It was the beginning of the rout"
"6855",36,"of civilisation, of the massacre of mankind."
"6856",36,""
"6857",36,"Directly below him the balloonist would have seen the network of"
"6858",36,"streets far and wide, houses, churches, squares, crescents,"
"6859",36,"gardens—already derelict—spread out like a huge map, and in the"
"6860",36,"southward _blotted_. Over Ealing, Richmond, Wimbledon, it would have"
"6861",36,"seemed as if some monstrous pen had flung ink upon the chart. Steadily,"
"6862",36,"incessantly, each black splash grew and spread, shooting out"
"6863",36,"ramifications this way and that, now banking itself against rising"
"6864",36,"ground, now pouring swiftly over a crest into a new-found valley,"
"6865",36,"exactly as a gout of ink would spread itself upon blotting paper."
"6866",36,""
"6867",36,"And beyond, over the blue hills that rise southward of the river, the"
"6868",36,"glittering Martians went to and fro, calmly and methodically spreading"
"6869",36,"their poison cloud over this patch of country and then over that,"
"6870",36,"laying it again with their steam jets when it had served its purpose,"
"6871",36,"and taking possession of the conquered country. They do not seem to"
"6872",36,"have aimed at extermination so much as at complete demoralisation and"
"6873",36,"the destruction of any opposition. They exploded any stores of powder"
"6874",36,"they came upon, cut every telegraph, and wrecked the railways here and"
"6875",36,"there. They were hamstringing mankind. They seemed in no hurry to"
"6876",36,"extend the field of their operations, and did not come beyond the"
"6877",36,"central part of London all that day. It is possible that a very"
"6878",36,"considerable number of people in London stuck to their houses through"
"6879",36,"Monday morning. Certain it is that many died at home suffocated by the"
"6880",36,"Black Smoke."
"6881",36,""
"6882",36,"Until about midday the Pool of London was an astonishing scene."
"6883",36,"Steamboats and shipping of all sorts lay there, tempted by the enormous"
"6884",36,"sums of money offered by fugitives, and it is said that many who swam"
"6885",36,"out to these vessels were thrust off with boathooks and drowned. About"
"6886",36,"one o’clock in the afternoon the thinning remnant of a cloud of the"
"6887",36,"black vapour appeared between the arches of Blackfriars Bridge. At that"
"6888",36,"the Pool became a scene of mad confusion, fighting, and collision, and"
"6889",36,"for some time a multitude of boats and barges jammed in the northern"

"6898",36,"Of the falling of the fifth cylinder I have presently to tell. The"

"6901",36,"the hills. On Tuesday the little party, still set upon getting across"
"6902",36,"the sea, made its way through the swarming country towards Colchester."
"6903",36,"The news that the Martians were now in possession of the whole of"

"6908",36,"That day the scattered multitudes began to realise the urgent need of"

"6911",36,"ripening root crops with arms in their hands. A number of people now,"
"6912",36,"like my brother, had their faces eastward, and there were some"
"6913",36,"desperate souls even going back towards London to get food. These were"
"6914",36,"chiefly people from the northern suburbs, whose knowledge of the Black"
"6915",36,"Smoke came by hearsay. He heard that about half the members of the"

"6918",36,"across the Midland counties."

"6920",36,"He was also told that the Midland Railway Company had replaced the"

"6922",36,"running northward trains from St. Albans to relieve the congestion of"
"6923",36,"the home counties. There was also a placard in Chipping Ongar"

"6925",36,"towns and that within twenty-four hours bread would be distributed"
"6926",36,"among the starving people in the neighbourhood. But this intelligence"
"6927",36,"did not deter him from the plan of escape he had formed, and the three"
"6928",36,"pressed eastward all day, and heard no more of the bread distribution"
"6929",36,"than this promise. Nor, as a matter of fact, did anyone else hear more"
"6930",36,"of it. That night fell the seventh star, falling upon Primrose Hill. It"

"6936",36,"inhabitants, calling itself the Committee of Public Supply, seized the"
"6937",36,"pony as provisions, and would give nothing in exchange for it but the"
"6938",36,"promise of a share in it the next day. Here there were rumours of"

"6944",36,"once to the coast rather than wait for food, although all three of them"
"6945",36,"were very hungry. By midday they passed through Tillingham, which,"
"6946",36,"strangely enough, seemed to be quite silent and deserted, save for a"
"6947",36,"few furtive plunderers hunting for food. Near Tillingham they suddenly"
"6948",36,"came in sight of the sea, and the most amazing crowd of shipping of all"
"6949",36,"sorts that it is possible to imagine."
"6950",36,""
"6951",36,"For after the sailors could no longer come up the Thames, they came on"
"6952",36,"to the Essex coast, to Harwich and Walton and Clacton, and afterwards"
"6953",36,"to Foulness and Shoebury, to bring off the people. They lay in a huge"
"6954",36,"sickle-shaped curve that vanished into mist at last towards the Naze."
"6955",36,"Close inshore was a multitude of fishing smacks—English, Scotch,"
"6956",36,"French, Dutch, and Swedish; steam launches from the Thames, yachts,"
"6957",36,"electric boats; and beyond were ships of larger burden, a multitude of"
"6958",36,"filthy colliers, trim merchantmen, cattle ships, passenger boats,"
"6959",36,"petroleum tanks, ocean tramps, an old white transport even, neat white"
"6960",36,"and grey liners from Southampton and Hamburg; and along the blue coast"
"6961",36,"across the Blackwater my brother could make out dimly a dense swarm of"
"6962",36,"boats chaffering with the people on the beach, a swarm which also"
"6963",36,"extended up the Blackwater almost to Maldon."
"6964",36,""
"6965",36,"About a couple of miles out lay an ironclad, very low in the water,"
"6966",36,"almost, to my brother’s perception, like a water-logged ship. This was"
"6967",36,"the ram _Thunder Child_. It was the only warship in sight, but far away"
"6968",36,"to the right over the smooth surface of the sea—for that day there was"
"6969",36,"a dead calm—lay a serpent of black smoke to mark the next ironclads of"
"6970",36,"the Channel Fleet, which hovered in an extended line, steam up and"
"6971",36,"ready for action, across the Thames estuary during the course of the"
"6972",36,"Martian conquest, vigilant and yet powerless to prevent it."
"6973",36,""
"6974",36,"At the sight of the sea, Mrs. Elphinstone, in spite of the assurances"
"6975",36,"of her sister-in-law, gave way to panic. She had never been out of"
"6976",36,"England before, she would rather die than trust herself friendless in a"
"6977",36,"foreign country, and so forth. She seemed, poor woman, to imagine that"
"6978",36,"the French and the Martians might prove very similar. She had been"
"6979",36,"growing increasingly hysterical, fearful, and depressed during the two"
"6980",36,"days’ journeyings. Her great idea was to return to Stanmore. Things had"
"6981",36,"been always well and safe at Stanmore. They would find George at"
"6982",36,"Stanmore...."
"6983",36,""
"6984",36,"It was with the greatest difficulty they could get her down to the"
"6985",36,"beach, where presently my brother succeeded in attracting the attention"
"6986",36,"of some men on a paddle steamer from the Thames. They sent a boat and"
"6987",36,"drove a bargain for thirty-six pounds for the three. The steamer was"
"6988",36,"going, these men said, to Ostend."
"6989",36,""
"6990",36,"It was about two o’clock when my brother, having paid their fares at"

"6997",36,"lay off the Blackwater until five in the afternoon, picking up"
"6998",36,"passengers until the seated decks were even dangerously crowded. He"
"6999",36,"would probably have remained longer had it not been for the sound of"
"7000",36,"guns that began about that hour in the south. As if in answer, the"
"7001",36,"ironclad seaward fired a small gun and hoisted a string of flags. A jet"
"7002",36,"of smoke sprang out of her funnels."
"7003",36,""
"7004",36,"Some of the passengers were of opinion that this firing came from"
"7005",36,"Shoeburyness, until it was noticed that it was growing louder. At the"
"7006",36,"same time, far away in the southeast the masts and upperworks of three"
"7007",36,"ironclads rose one after the other out of the sea, beneath clouds of"
"7008",36,"black smoke. But my brother’s attention speedily reverted to the"
"7009",36,"distant firing in the south. He fancied he saw a column of smoke rising"
"7010",36,"out of the distant grey haze."

"7015",36,"advancing along the muddy coast from the direction of Foulness. At that"
"7016",36,"the captain on the bridge swore at the top of his voice with fear and"
"7017",36,"anger at his own delay, and the paddles seemed infected with his"
"7018",36,"terror. Every soul aboard stood at the bulwarks or on the seats of the"
"7019",36,"steamer and stared at that distant shape, higher than the trees or"
"7020",36,"church towers inland, and advancing with a leisurely parody of a human"
"7021",36,"stride."
"7022",36,""
"7023",36,"It was the first Martian my brother had seen, and he stood, more amazed"
"7024",36,"than terrified, watching this Titan advancing deliberately towards the"
"7025",36,"shipping, wading farther and farther into the water as the coast fell"
"7026",36,"away. Then, far away beyond the Crouch, came another, striding over"
"7027",36,"some stunted trees, and then yet another, still farther off, wading"
"7028",36,"deeply through a shiny mudflat that seemed to hang halfway up between"
"7029",36,"sea and sky. They were all stalking seaward, as if to intercept the"
"7030",36,"escape of the multitudinous vessels that were crowded between Foulness"
"7031",36,"and the Naze. In spite of the throbbing exertions of the engines of the"
"7032",36,"little paddle-boat, and the pouring foam that her wheels flung behind"
"7033",36,"her, she receded with terrifying slowness from this ominous advance."
"7034",36,""
"7035",36,"Glancing northwestward, my brother saw the large crescent of shipping"
"7036",36,"already writhing with the approaching terror; one ship passing behind"
"7037",36,"another, another coming round from broadside to end on, steamships"
"7038",36,"whistling and giving off volumes of steam, sails being let out,"
"7039",36,"launches rushing hither and thither. He was so fascinated by this and"
"7040",36,"by the creeping danger away to the left that he had no eyes for"
"7041",36,"anything seaward. And then a swift movement of the steamboat (she had"
"7042",36,"suddenly come round to avoid being run down) flung him headlong from"
"7043",36,"the seat upon which he was standing. There was a shouting all about"
"7044",36,"him, a trampling of feet, and a cheer that seemed to be answered"
"7045",36,"faintly. The steamboat lurched and rolled him over upon his hands."
"7046",36,""
"7047",36,"He sprang to his feet and saw to starboard, and not a hundred yards"
"7048",36,"from their heeling, pitching boat, a vast iron bulk like the blade of a"
"7049",36,"plough tearing through the water, tossing it on either side in huge"
"7050",36,"waves of foam that leaped towards the steamer, flinging her paddles"
"7051",36,"helplessly in the air, and then sucking her deck down almost to the"
"7052",36,"waterline."
"7053",36,""
"7054",36,"A douche of spray blinded my brother for a moment. When his eyes were"
"7055",36,"clear again he saw the monster had passed and was rushing landward. Big"
"7056",36,"iron upperworks rose out of this headlong structure, and from that twin"
"7057",36,"funnels projected and spat a smoking blast shot with fire. It was the"
"7058",36,"torpedo ram, _Thunder Child_, steaming headlong, coming to the rescue"
"7059",36,"of the threatened shipping."
"7060",36,""
"7061",36,"Keeping his footing on the heaving deck by clutching the bulwarks, my"
"7062",36,"brother looked past this charging leviathan at the Martians again, and"
"7063",36,"he saw the three of them now close together, and standing so far out to"
"7064",36,"sea that their tripod supports were almost entirely submerged. Thus"
"7065",36,"sunken, and seen in remote perspective, they appeared far less"
"7066",36,"formidable than the huge iron bulk in whose wake the steamer was"
"7067",36,"pitching so helplessly. It would seem they were regarding this new"
"7068",36,"antagonist with astonishment. To their intelligence, it may be, the"
"7069",36,"giant was even such another as themselves. The _Thunder Child_ fired no"
"7070",36,"gun, but simply drove full speed towards them. It was probably her not"
"7071",36,"firing that enabled her to get so near the enemy as she did. They did"
"7072",36,"not know what to make of her. One shell, and they would have sent her"
"7073",36,"to the bottom forthwith with the Heat-Ray."
"7074",36,""
"7075",36,"She was steaming at such a pace that in a minute she seemed halfway"
"7076",36,"between the steamboat and the Martians—a diminishing black bulk against"
"7077",36,"the receding horizontal expanse of the Essex coast."
"7078",36,""
"7079",36,"Suddenly the foremost Martian lowered his tube and discharged a"
"7080",36,"canister of the black gas at the ironclad. It hit her larboard side and"
"7081",36,"glanced off in an inky jet that rolled away to seaward, an unfolding"
"7082",36,"torrent of Black Smoke, from which the ironclad drove clear. To the"
"7083",36,"watchers from the steamer, low in the water and with the sun in their"
"7084",36,"eyes, it seemed as though she were already among the Martians."
"7085",36,""
"7086",36,"They saw the gaunt figures separating and rising out of the water as"
"7087",36,"they retreated shoreward, and one of them raised the camera-like"
"7088",36,"generator of the Heat-Ray. He held it pointing obliquely downward, and"
"7089",36,"a bank of steam sprang from the water at its touch. It must have driven"
"7090",36,"through the iron of the ship’s side like a white-hot iron rod through"
"7091",36,"paper."
"7092",36,""
"7093",36,"A flicker of flame went up through the rising steam, and then the"
"7094",36,"Martian reeled and staggered. In another moment he was cut down, and a"
"7095",36,"great body of water and steam shot high in the air. The guns of the"
"7096",36,"_Thunder Child_ sounded through the reek, going off one after the"
"7097",36,"other, and one shot splashed the water high close by the steamer,"
"7098",36,"ricocheted towards the other flying ships to the north, and smashed a"
"7099",36,"smack to matchwood."
"7100",36,""
"7101",36,"But no one heeded that very much. At the sight of the Martian’s"
"7102",36,"collapse the captain on the bridge yelled inarticulately, and all the"
"7103",36,"crowding passengers on the steamer’s stern shouted together. And then"
"7104",36,"they yelled again. For, surging out beyond the white tumult, drove"
"7105",36,"something long and black, the flames streaming from its middle parts,"
"7106",36,"its ventilators and funnels spouting fire."
"7107",36,""
"7108",36,"She was alive still; the steering gear, it seems, was intact and her"
"7109",36,"engines working. She headed straight for a second Martian, and was"
"7110",36,"within a hundred yards of him when the Heat-Ray came to bear. Then with"
"7111",36,"a violent thud, a blinding flash, her decks, her funnels, leaped"
"7112",36,"upward. The Martian staggered with the violence of her explosion, and"
"7113",36,"in another moment the flaming wreckage, still driving forward with the"
"7114",36,"impetus of its pace, had struck him and crumpled him up like a thing of"
"7115",36,"cardboard. My brother shouted involuntarily. A boiling tumult of steam"
"7116",36,"hid everything again."
"7117",36,""
"7118",36,"“Two!” yelled the captain."
"7119",36,""
"7120",36,"Everyone was shouting. The whole steamer from end to end rang with"
"7121",36,"frantic cheering that was taken up first by one and then by all in the"
"7122",36,"crowding multitude of ships and boats that was driving out to sea."
"7123",36,""
"7124",36,"The steam hung upon the water for many minutes, hiding the third"
"7125",36,"Martian and the coast altogether. And all this time the boat was"
"7126",36,"paddling steadily out to sea and away from the fight; and when at last"
"7127",36,"the confusion cleared, the drifting bank of black vapour intervened,"
"7128",36,"and nothing of the _Thunder Child_ could be made out, nor could the"
"7129",36,"third Martian be seen. But the ironclads to seaward were now quite"
"7130",36,"close and standing in towards shore past the steamboat."
"7131",36,""
"7132",36,"The little vessel continued to beat its way seaward, and the ironclads"
"7133",36,"receded slowly towards the coast, which was hidden still by a marbled"
"7134",36,"bank of vapour, part steam, part black gas, eddying and combining in"
"7135",36,"the strangest way. The fleet of refugees was scattering to the"
"7136",36,"northeast; several smacks were sailing between the ironclads and the"
"7137",36,"steamboat. After a time, and before they reached the sinking cloud"
"7138",36,"bank, the warships turned northward, and then abruptly went about and"
"7139",36,"passed into the thickening haze of evening southward. The coast grew"
"7140",36,"faint, and at last indistinguishable amid the low banks of clouds that"
"7141",36,"were gathering about the sinking sun."
"7142",36,""
"7143",36,"Then suddenly out of the golden haze of the sunset came the vibration"
"7144",36,"of guns, and a form of black shadows moving. Everyone struggled to the"

"7146",36,"but nothing was to be distinguished clearly. A mass of smoke rose"
"7147",36,"slanting and barred the face of the sun. The steamboat throbbed on its"

"7153",36,"up into the sky out of the greyness—rushed slantingly upward and very"
"7154",36,"swiftly into the luminous clearness above the clouds in the western"
"7155",36,"sky; something flat and broad, and very large, that swept round in a"

"7188",36,"not bravery, but circumspection. My only consolation was to believe"
"7189",36,"that the Martians were moving Londonward and away from her. Such vague"

"7278",36,"emerged upon the road towards Kew. The curate I left in the shed, but"
"7279",36,"he came hurrying after me."
"7280",36,""
"7281",36,"That second start was the most foolhardy thing I ever did. For it was"
"7282",36,"manifest the Martians were about us. No sooner had the curate overtaken"
"7283",36,"me than we saw either the fighting-machine we had seen before or"
"7284",36,"another, far away across the meadows in the direction of Kew Lodge."
"7285",36,"Four or five little black figures hurried before it across the"
"7286",36,"green-grey of the field, and in a moment it was evident this Martian"
"7287",36,"pursued them. In three strides he was among them, and they ran"
"7288",36,"radiating from his feet in all directions. He used no Heat-Ray to"
"7289",36,"destroy them, but picked them up one by one. Apparently he tossed them"
"7290",36,"into the great metallic carrier which projected behind him, much as a"
"7291",36,"workman’s basket hangs over his shoulder."
"7292",36,""
"7293",36,"It was the first time I realised that the Martians might have any other"
"7294",36,"purpose than destruction with defeated humanity. We stood for a moment"
"7295",36,"petrified, then turned and fled through a gate behind us into a walled"
"7296",36,"garden, fell into, rather than found, a fortunate ditch, and lay there,"
"7297",36,"scarce daring to whisper to each other until the stars were out."
"7298",36,""
"7299",36,"I suppose it was nearly eleven o’clock before we gathered courage to"
"7300",36,"start again, no longer venturing into the road, but sneaking along"
"7301",36,"hedgerows and through plantations, and watching keenly through the"
"7302",36,"darkness, he on the right and I on the left, for the Martians, who"
"7303",36,"seemed to be all about us. In one place we blundered upon a scorched"
"7304",36,"and blackened area, now cooling and ashen, and a number of scattered"
"7305",36,"dead bodies of men, burned horribly about the heads and trunks but with"
"7306",36,"their legs and boots mostly intact; and of dead horses, fifty feet,"
"7307",36,"perhaps, behind a line of four ripped guns and smashed gun carriages."
"7308",36,""
"7309",36,"Sheen, it seemed, had escaped destruction, but the place was silent and"
"7310",36,"deserted. Here we happened on no dead, though the night was too dark"
"7311",36,"for us to see into the side roads of the place. In Sheen my companion"
"7312",36,"suddenly complained of faintness and thirst, and we decided to try one"
"7313",36,"of the houses."
"7314",36,""
"7315",36,"The first house we entered, after a little difficulty with the window,"
"7316",36,"was a small semi-detached villa, and I found nothing eatable left in"
"7317",36,"the place but some mouldy cheese. There was, however, water to drink;"
"7318",36,"and I took a hatchet, which promised to be useful in our next"
"7319",36,"house-breaking."
"7320",36,""
"7321",36,"We then crossed to a place where the road turns towards Mortlake. Here"
"7322",36,"there stood a white house within a walled garden, and in the pantry of"
"7323",36,"this domicile we found a store of food—two loaves of bread in a pan, an"
"7324",36,"uncooked steak, and the half of a ham. I give this catalogue so"
"7325",36,"precisely because, as it happened, we were destined to subsist upon"
"7326",36,"this store for the next fortnight. Bottled beer stood under a shelf,"
"7327",36,"and there were two bags of haricot beans and some limp lettuces. This"
"7328",36,"pantry opened into a kind of wash-up kitchen, and in this was firewood;"
"7329",36,"there was also a cupboard, in which we found nearly a dozen of"
"7330",36,"burgundy, tinned soups and salmon, and two tins of biscuits."
"7331",36,""
"7332",36,"We sat in the adjacent kitchen in the dark—for we dared not strike a"
"7333",36,"light—and ate bread and ham, and drank beer out of the same bottle. The"
"7334",36,"curate, who was still timorous and restless, was now, oddly enough, for"
"7335",36,"pushing on, and I was urging him to keep up his strength by eating when"
"7336",36,"the thing happened that was to imprison us."
"7337",36,""
"7338",36,"“It can’t be midnight yet,” I said, and then came a blinding glare of"
"7339",36,"vivid green light. Everything in the kitchen leaped out, clearly"
"7340",36,"visible in green and black, and vanished again. And then followed such"
"7341",36,"a concussion as I have never heard before or since. So close on the"
"7342",36,"heels of this as to seem instantaneous came a thud behind me, a clash"
"7343",36,"of glass, a crash and rattle of falling masonry all about us, and the"
"7344",36,"plaster of the ceiling came down upon us, smashing into a multitude of"
"7345",36,"fragments upon our heads. I was knocked headlong across the floor"
"7346",36,"against the oven handle and stunned. I was insensible for a long time,"
"7347",36,"the curate told me, and when I came to we were in darkness again, and"
"7348",36,"he, with a face wet, as I found afterwards, with blood from a cut"
"7349",36,"forehead, was dabbing water over me."
"7350",36,""
"7351",36,"For some time I could not recollect what had happened. Then things came"
"7352",36,"to me slowly. A bruise on my temple asserted itself."
"7353",36,""
"7354",36,"“Are you better?” asked the curate in a whisper."
"7355",36,""
"7356",36,"At last I answered him. I sat up."
"7357",36,""
"7358",36,"“Don’t move,” he said. “The floor is covered with smashed crockery from"
"7359",36,"the dresser. You can’t possibly move without making a noise, and I"
"7360",36,"fancy _they_ are outside.”"
"7361",36,""
"7362",36,"We both sat quite silent, so that we could scarcely hear each other"
"7363",36,"breathing. Everything seemed deadly still, but once something near us,"
"7364",36,"some plaster or broken brickwork, slid down with a rumbling sound."
"7365",36,"Outside and very near was an intermittent, metallic rattle."
"7366",36,""
"7367",36,"“That!” said the curate, when presently it happened again."
"7368",36,""
"7369",36,"“Yes,” I said. “But what is it?”"
"7370",36,""
"7371",36,"“A Martian!” said the curate."
"7372",36,""
"7373",36,"I listened again."
"7374",36,""
"7375",36,"“It was not like the Heat-Ray,” I said, and for a time I was inclined"
"7376",36,"to think one of the great fighting-machines had stumbled against the"
"7377",36,"house, as I had seen one stumble against the tower of Shepperton"
"7378",36,"Church."
"7379",36,""
"7380",36,"Our situation was so strange and incomprehensible that for three or"
"7381",36,"four hours, until the dawn came, we scarcely moved. And then the light"
"7382",36,"filtered in, not through the window, which remained black, but through"
"7383",36,"a triangular aperture between a beam and a heap of broken bricks in the"
"7384",36,"wall behind us. The interior of the kitchen we now saw greyly for the"
"7385",36,"first time."
"7386",36,""
"7387",36,"The window had been burst in by a mass of garden mould, which flowed"
"7388",36,"over the table upon which we had been sitting and lay about our feet."
"7389",36,"Outside, the soil was banked high against the house. At the top of the"
"7390",36,"window frame we could see an uprooted drainpipe. The floor was littered"
"7391",36,"with smashed hardware; the end of the kitchen towards the house was"
"7392",36,"broken into, and since the daylight shone in there, it was evident the"
"7393",36,"greater part of the house had collapsed. Contrasting vividly with this"
"7394",36,"ruin was the neat dresser, stained in the fashion, pale green, and with"
"7395",36,"a number of copper and tin vessels below it, the wallpaper imitating"
"7396",36,"blue and white tiles, and a couple of coloured supplements fluttering"
"7397",36,"from the walls above the kitchen range."
"7398",36,""
"7399",36,"As the dawn grew clearer, we saw through the gap in the wall the body"
"7400",36,"of a Martian, standing sentinel, I suppose, over the still glowing"
"7401",36,"cylinder. At the sight of that we crawled as circumspectly as possible"
"7402",36,"out of the twilight of the kitchen into the darkness of the scullery."
"7403",36,""
"7404",36,"Abruptly the right interpretation dawned upon my mind."
"7405",36,""
"7406",36,"“The fifth cylinder,” I whispered, “the fifth shot from Mars, has"
"7407",36,"struck this house and buried us under the ruins!”"
"7408",36,""
"7409",36,"For a time the curate was silent, and then he whispered:"
"7410",36,""
"7411",36,"“God have mercy upon us!”"
"7412",36,""
"7413",36,"I heard him presently whimpering to himself."
"7414",36,""
"7415",36,"Save for that sound we lay quite still in the scullery; I for my part"
"7416",36,"scarce dared breathe, and sat with my eyes fixed on the faint light of"
"7417",36,"the kitchen door. I could just see the curate’s face, a dim, oval"
"7418",36,"shape, and his collar and cuffs. Outside there began a metallic"
"7419",36,"hammering, then a violent hooting, and then again, after a quiet"
"7420",36,"interval, a hissing like the hissing of an engine. These noises, for"
"7421",36,"the most part problematical, continued intermittently, and seemed if"
"7422",36,"anything to increase in number as time wore on. Presently a measured"
"7423",36,"thudding and a vibration that made everything about us quiver and the"
"7424",36,"vessels in the pantry ring and shift, began and continued. Once the"
"7425",36,"light was eclipsed, and the ghostly kitchen doorway became absolutely"
"7426",36,"dark. For many hours we must have crouched there, silent and shivering,"
"7427",36,"until our tired attention failed. . . ."
"7428",36,""
"7429",36,"At last I found myself awake and very hungry. I am inclined to believe"
"7430",36,"we must have spent the greater portion of a day before that awakening."
"7431",36,"My hunger was at a stride so insistent that it moved me to action. I"
"7432",36,"told the curate I was going to seek food, and felt my way towards the"
"7433",36,"pantry. He made me no answer, but so soon as I began eating the faint"
"7434",36,"noise I made stirred him up and I heard him crawling after me."

"7440",36,"WHAT WE SAW FROM THE RUINED HOUSE."
"7441",36,""
"7442",36,""
"7443",36,"After eating we crept back to the scullery, and there I must have dozed"
"7444",36,"again, for when presently I looked round I was alone. The thudding"
"7445",36,"vibration continued with wearisome persistence. I whispered for the"
"7446",36,"curate several times, and at last felt my way to the door of the"
"7447",36,"kitchen. It was still daylight, and I perceived him across the room,"
"7448",36,"lying against the triangular hole that looked out upon the Martians."
"7449",36,"His shoulders were hunched, so that his head was hidden from me."
"7450",36,""
"7451",36,"I could hear a number of noises almost like those in an engine shed;"
"7452",36,"and the place rocked with that beating thud. Through the aperture in"
"7453",36,"the wall I could see the top of a tree touched with gold and the warm"
"7454",36,"blue of a tranquil evening sky. For a minute or so I remained watching"
"7455",36,"the curate, and then I advanced, crouching and stepping with extreme"
"7456",36,"care amid the broken crockery that littered the floor."
"7457",36,""
"7458",36,"I touched the curate’s leg, and he started so violently that a mass of"
"7459",36,"plaster went sliding down outside and fell with a loud impact. I"
"7460",36,"gripped his arm, fearing he might cry out, and for a long time we"
"7461",36,"crouched motionless. Then I turned to see how much of our rampart"
"7462",36,"remained. The detachment of the plaster had left a vertical slit open"
"7463",36,"in the debris, and by raising myself cautiously across a beam I was"
"7464",36,"able to see out of this gap into what had been overnight a quiet"
"7465",36,"suburban roadway. Vast, indeed, was the change that we beheld."
"7466",36,""
"7467",36,"The fifth cylinder must have fallen right into the midst of the house"
"7468",36,"we had first visited. The building had vanished, completely smashed,"
"7469",36,"pulverised, and dispersed by the blow. The cylinder lay now far beneath"
"7470",36,"the original foundations—deep in a hole, already vastly larger than the"
"7471",36,"pit I had looked into at Woking. The earth all round it had splashed"
"7472",36,"under that tremendous impact—“splashed” is the only word—and lay in"
"7473",36,"heaped piles that hid the masses of the adjacent houses. It had behaved"
"7474",36,"exactly like mud under the violent blow of a hammer. Our house had"
"7475",36,"collapsed backward; the front portion, even on the ground floor, had"
"7476",36,"been destroyed completely; by a chance the kitchen and scullery had"
"7477",36,"escaped, and stood buried now under soil and ruins, closed in by tons"
"7478",36,"of earth on every side save towards the cylinder. Over that aspect we"
"7479",36,"hung now on the very edge of the great circular pit the Martians were"
"7480",36,"engaged in making. The heavy beating sound was evidently just behind"
"7481",36,"us, and ever and again a bright green vapour drove up like a veil"
"7482",36,"across our peephole."
"7483",36,""
"7484",36,"The cylinder was already opened in the centre of the pit, and on the"
"7485",36,"farther edge of the pit, amid the smashed and gravel-heaped shrubbery,"
"7486",36,"one of the great fighting-machines, deserted by its occupant, stood"
"7487",36,"stiff and tall against the evening sky. At first I scarcely noticed the"
"7488",36,"pit and the cylinder, although it has been convenient to describe them"
"7489",36,"first, on account of the extraordinary glittering mechanism I saw busy"
"7490",36,"in the excavation, and on account of the strange creatures that were"
"7491",36,"crawling slowly and painfully across the heaped mould near it."
"7492",36,""
"7493",36,"The mechanism it certainly was that held my attention first. It was one"
"7494",36,"of those complicated fabrics that have since been called"
"7495",36,"handling-machines, and the study of which has already given such an"
"7496",36,"enormous impetus to terrestrial invention. As it dawned upon me first,"
"7497",36,"it presented a sort of metallic spider with five jointed, agile legs,"
"7498",36,"and with an extraordinary number of jointed levers, bars, and reaching"
"7499",36,"and clutching tentacles about its body. Most of its arms were"
"7500",36,"retracted, but with three long tentacles it was fishing out a number of"
"7501",36,"rods, plates, and bars which lined the covering and apparently"
"7502",36,"strengthened the walls of the cylinder. These, as it extracted them,"
"7503",36,"were lifted out and deposited upon a level surface of earth behind it."
"7504",36,""
"7505",36,"Its motion was so swift, complex, and perfect that at first I did not"
"7506",36,"see it as a machine, in spite of its metallic glitter. The"
"7507",36,"fighting-machines were coordinated and animated to an extraordinary"
"7508",36,"pitch, but nothing to compare with this. People who have never seen"
"7509",36,"these structures, and have only the ill-imagined efforts of artists or"
"7510",36,"the imperfect descriptions of such eye-witnesses as myself to go upon,"
"7511",36,"scarcely realise that living quality."
"7512",36,""
"7513",36,"I recall particularly the illustration of one of the first pamphlets to"
"7514",36,"give a consecutive account of the war. The artist had evidently made a"
"7515",36,"hasty study of one of the fighting-machines, and there his knowledge"
"7516",36,"ended. He presented them as tilted, stiff tripods, without either"
"7517",36,"flexibility or subtlety, and with an altogether misleading monotony of"
"7518",36,"effect. The pamphlet containing these renderings had a considerable"
"7519",36,"vogue, and I mention them here simply to warn the reader against the"
"7520",36,"impression they may have created. They were no more like the Martians I"
"7521",36,"saw in action than a Dutch doll is like a human being. To my mind, the"
"7522",36,"pamphlet would have been much better without them."
"7523",36,""
"7524",36,"At first, I say, the handling-machine did not impress me as a machine,"
"7525",36,"but as a crablike creature with a glittering integument, the"
"7526",36,"controlling Martian whose delicate tentacles actuated its movements"
"7527",36,"seeming to be simply the equivalent of the crab’s cerebral portion. But"
"7528",36,"then I perceived the resemblance of its grey-brown, shiny, leathery"
"7529",36,"integument to that of the other sprawling bodies beyond, and the true"
"7530",36,"nature of this dexterous workman dawned upon me. With that realisation"
"7531",36,"my interest shifted to those other creatures, the real Martians."
"7532",36,"Already I had had a transient impression of these, and the first nausea"
"7533",36,"no longer obscured my observation. Moreover, I was concealed and"
"7534",36,"motionless, and under no urgency of action."
"7535",36,""
"7536",36,"They were, I now saw, the most unearthly creatures it is possible to"
"7537",36,"conceive. They were huge round bodies—or, rather, heads—about four feet"
"7538",36,"in diameter, each body having in front of it a face. This face had no"
"7539",36,"nostrils—indeed, the Martians do not seem to have had any sense of"
"7540",36,"smell, but it had a pair of very large dark-coloured eyes, and just"
"7541",36,"beneath this a kind of fleshy beak. In the back of this head or body—I"
"7542",36,"scarcely know how to speak of it—was the single tight tympanic surface,"
"7543",36,"since known to be anatomically an ear, though it must have been almost"
"7544",36,"useless in our dense air. In a group round the mouth were sixteen"
"7545",36,"slender, almost whiplike tentacles, arranged in two bunches of eight"
"7546",36,"each. These bunches have since been named rather aptly, by that"
"7547",36,"distinguished anatomist, Professor Howes, the _hands_. Even as I saw"
"7548",36,"these Martians for the first time they seemed to be endeavouring to"
"7549",36,"raise themselves on these hands, but of course, with the increased"
"7550",36,"weight of terrestrial conditions, this was impossible. There is reason"
"7551",36,"to suppose that on Mars they may have progressed upon them with some"
"7552",36,"facility."
"7553",36,""
"7554",36,"The internal anatomy, I may remark here, as dissection has since shown,"
"7555",36,"was almost equally simple. The greater part of the structure was the"
"7556",36,"brain, sending enormous nerves to the eyes, ear, and tactile tentacles."
"7557",36,"Besides this were the bulky lungs, into which the mouth opened, and the"
"7558",36,"heart and its vessels. The pulmonary distress caused by the denser"
"7559",36,"atmosphere and greater gravitational attraction was only too evident in"
"7560",36,"the convulsive movements of the outer skin."
"7561",36,""
"7562",36,"And this was the sum of the Martian organs. Strange as it may seem to a"
"7563",36,"human being, all the complex apparatus of digestion, which makes up the"
"7564",36,"bulk of our bodies, did not exist in the Martians. They were"
"7565",36,"heads—merely heads. Entrails they had none. They did not eat, much less"
"7566",36,"digest. Instead, they took the fresh, living blood of other creatures,"
"7567",36,"and _injected_ it into their own veins. I have myself seen this being"
"7568",36,"done, as I shall mention in its place. But, squeamish as I may seem, I"
"7569",36,"cannot bring myself to describe what I could not endure even to"
"7570",36,"continue watching. Let it suffice to say, blood obtained from a still"
"7571",36,"living animal, in most cases from a human being, was run directly by"
"7572",36,"means of a little pipette into the recipient canal. . . ."
"7573",36,""
"7574",36,"The bare idea of this is no doubt horribly repulsive to us, but at the"
"7575",36,"same time I think that we should remember how repulsive our carnivorous"
"7576",36,"habits would seem to an intelligent rabbit."
"7577",36,""
"7578",36,"The physiological advantages of the practice of injection are"
"7579",36,"undeniable, if one thinks of the tremendous waste of human time and"
"7580",36,"energy occasioned by eating and the digestive process. Our bodies are"
"7581",36,"half made up of glands and tubes and organs, occupied in turning"
"7582",36,"heterogeneous food into blood. The digestive processes and their"
"7583",36,"reaction upon the nervous system sap our strength and colour our minds."
"7584",36,"Men go happy or miserable as they have healthy or unhealthy livers, or"
"7585",36,"sound gastric glands. But the Martians were lifted above all these"
"7586",36,"organic fluctuations of mood and emotion."
"7587",36,""
"7588",36,"Their undeniable preference for men as their source of nourishment is"
"7589",36,"partly explained by the nature of the remains of the victims they had"
"7590",36,"brought with them as provisions from Mars. These creatures, to judge"
"7591",36,"from the shrivelled remains that have fallen into human hands, were"
"7592",36,"bipeds with flimsy, silicious skeletons (almost like those of the"
"7593",36,"silicious sponges) and feeble musculature, standing about six feet high"
"7594",36,"and having round, erect heads, and large eyes in flinty sockets. Two or"
"7595",36,"three of these seem to have been brought in each cylinder, and all were"
"7596",36,"killed before earth was reached. It was just as well for them, for the"
"7597",36,"mere attempt to stand upright upon our planet would have broken every"
"7598",36,"bone in their bodies."
"7599",36,""
"7600",36,"And while I am engaged in this description, I may add in this place"
"7601",36,"certain further details which, although they were not all evident to us"
"7602",36,"at the time, will enable the reader who is unacquainted with them to"
"7603",36,"form a clearer picture of these offensive creatures."
"7604",36,""
"7605",36,"In three other points their physiology differed strangely from ours."
"7606",36,"Their organisms did not sleep, any more than the heart of man sleeps."
"7607",36,"Since they had no extensive muscular mechanism to recuperate, that"
"7608",36,"periodical extinction was unknown to them. They had little or no sense"
"7609",36,"of fatigue, it would seem. On earth they could never have moved without"
"7610",36,"effort, yet even to the last they kept in action. In twenty-four hours"
"7611",36,"they did twenty-four hours of work, as even on earth is perhaps the"
"7612",36,"case with the ants."
"7613",36,""
"7614",36,"In the next place, wonderful as it seems in a sexual world, the"
"7615",36,"Martians were absolutely without sex, and therefore without any of the"
"7616",36,"tumultuous emotions that arise from that difference among men. A young"
"7617",36,"Martian, there can now be no dispute, was really born upon earth during"
"7618",36,"the war, and it was found attached to its parent, partially _budded_"

"7625",36,"cousins of the vertebrated animals, the Tunicates, the two processes"
"7626",36,"occur side by side, but finally the sexual method superseded its"
"7627",36,"competitor altogether. On Mars, however, just the reverse has"
"7628",36,"apparently been the case."

"7630",36,"It is worthy of remark that a certain speculative writer of"
"7631",36,"quasi-scientific repute, writing long before the Martian invasion, did"
"7632",36,"forecast for man a final structure not unlike the actual Martian"
"7633",36,"condition. His prophecy, I remember, appeared in November or December,"
"7634",36,"1893, in a long-defunct publication, the _Pall Mall Budget_, and I"
"7635",36,"recall a caricature of it in a pre-Martian periodical called _Punch_."
"7636",36,"He pointed out—writing in a foolish, facetious tone—that the perfection"
"7637",36,"of mechanical appliances must ultimately supersede limbs; the"
"7638",36,"perfection of chemical devices, digestion; that such organs as hair,"
"7639",36,"external nose, teeth, ears, and chin were no longer essential parts of"
"7640",36,"the human being, and that the tendency of natural selection would lie"
"7641",36,"in the direction of their steady diminution through the coming ages."
"7642",36,"The brain alone remained a cardinal necessity. Only one other part of"
"7643",36,"the body had a strong case for survival, and that was the hand,"
"7644",36,"“teacher and agent of the brain.” While the rest of the body dwindled,"
"7645",36,"the hands would grow larger."
"7646",36,""
"7647",36,"There is many a true word written in jest, and here in the Martians we"
"7648",36,"have beyond dispute the actual accomplishment of such a suppression of"
"7649",36,"the animal side of the organism by the intelligence. To me it is quite"
"7650",36,"credible that the Martians may be descended from beings not unlike"
"7651",36,"ourselves, by a gradual development of brain and hands (the latter"
"7652",36,"giving rise to the two bunches of delicate tentacles at last) at the"
"7653",36,"expense of the rest of the body. Without the body the brain would, of"

"7664",36,"the life on Mars and terrestrial life, I may allude here to the curious"
"7665",36,"suggestions of the red weed."
"7666",36,""
"7667",36,"Apparently the vegetable kingdom in Mars, instead of having green for a"
"7668",36,"dominant colour, is of a vivid blood-red tint. At any rate, the seeds"
"7669",36,"which the Martians (intentionally or accidentally) brought with them"
"7670",36,"gave rise in all cases to red-coloured growths. Only that known"
"7671",36,"popularly as the red weed, however, gained any footing in competition"
"7672",36,"with terrestrial forms. The red creeper was quite a transitory growth,"
"7673",36,"and few people have seen it growing. For a time, however, the red weed"
"7674",36,"grew with astonishing vigour and luxuriance. It spread up the sides of"
"7675",36,"the pit by the third or fourth day of our imprisonment, and its"
"7676",36,"cactus-like branches formed a carmine fringe to the edges of our"
"7677",36,"triangular window. And afterwards I found it broadcast throughout the"
"7678",36,"country, and especially wherever there was a stream of water."
"7679",36,""
"7680",36,"The Martians had what appears to have been an auditory organ, a single"
"7681",36,"round drum at the back of the head-body, and eyes with a visual range"
"7682",36,"not very different from ours except that, according to Philips, blue"
"7683",36,"and violet were as black to them. It is commonly supposed that they"
"7684",36,"communicated by sounds and tentacular gesticulations; this is asserted,"
"7685",36,"for instance, in the able but hastily compiled pamphlet (written"
"7686",36,"evidently by someone not an eye-witness of Martian actions) to which I"
"7687",36,"have already alluded, and which, so far, has been the chief source of"
"7688",36,"information concerning them. Now no surviving human being saw so much"
"7689",36,"of the Martians in action as I did. I take no credit to myself for an"
"7690",36,"accident, but the fact is so. And I assert that I watched them closely"
"7691",36,"time after time, and that I have seen four, five, and (once) six of"
"7692",36,"them sluggishly performing the most elaborately complicated operations"
"7693",36,"together without either sound or gesture. Their peculiar hooting"
"7694",36,"invariably preceded feeding; it had no modulation, and was, I believe,"
"7695",36,"in no sense a signal, but merely the expiration of air preparatory to"
"7696",36,"the suctional operation. I have a certain claim to at least an"
"7697",36,"elementary knowledge of psychology, and in this matter I am"
"7698",36,"convinced—as firmly as I am convinced of anything—that the Martians"
"7699",36,"interchanged thoughts without any physical intermediation. And I have"
"7700",36,"been convinced of this in spite of strong preconceptions. Before the"
"7701",36,"Martian invasion, as an occasional reader here or there may remember, I"
"7702",36,"had written with some little vehemence against the telepathic theory."
"7703",36,""
"7704",36,"The Martians wore no clothing. Their conceptions of ornament and"
"7705",36,"decorum were necessarily different from ours; and not only were they"
"7706",36,"evidently much less sensible of changes of temperature than we are, but"
"7707",36,"changes of pressure do not seem to have affected their health at all"
"7708",36,"seriously. Yet though they wore no clothing, it was in the other"
"7709",36,"artificial additions to their bodily resources that their great"
"7710",36,"superiority over man lay. We men, with our bicycles and road-skates,"
"7711",36,"our Lilienthal soaring-machines, our guns and sticks and so forth, are"
"7712",36,"just in the beginning of the evolution that the Martians have worked"
"7713",36,"out. They have become practically mere brains, wearing different bodies"
"7714",36,"according to their needs just as men wear suits of clothes and take a"
"7715",36,"bicycle in a hurry or an umbrella in the wet. And of their appliances,"
"7716",36,"perhaps nothing is more wonderful to a man than the curious fact that"
"7717",36,"what is the dominant feature of almost all human devices in mechanism"
"7718",36,"is absent—the _wheel_ is absent; among all the things they brought to"
"7719",36,"earth there is no trace or suggestion of their use of wheels. One would"
"7720",36,"have at least expected it in locomotion. And in this connection it is"
"7721",36,"curious to remark that even on this earth Nature has never hit upon the"
"7722",36,"wheel, or has preferred other expedients to its development. And not"
"7723",36,"only did the Martians either not know of (which is incredible), or"
"7724",36,"abstain from, the wheel, but in their apparatus singularly little use"
"7725",36,"is made of the fixed pivot or relatively fixed pivot, with circular"
"7726",36,"motions thereabout confined to one plane. Almost all the joints of the"
"7727",36,"machinery present a complicated system of sliding parts moving over"
"7728",36,"small but beautifully curved friction bearings. And while upon this"
"7729",36,"matter of detail, it is remarkable that the long leverages of their"
"7730",36,"machines are in most cases actuated by a sort of sham musculature of"
"7731",36,"the disks in an elastic sheath; these disks become polarised and drawn"
"7732",36,"closely and powerfully together when traversed by a current of"
"7733",36,"electricity. In this way the curious parallelism to animal motions,"
"7734",36,"which was so striking and disturbing to the human beholder, was"
"7735",36,"attained. Such quasi-muscles abounded in the crablike handling-machine"
"7736",36,"which, on my first peeping out of the slit, I watched unpacking the"
"7737",36,"cylinder. It seemed infinitely more alive than the actual Martians"
"7738",36,"lying beyond it in the sunset light, panting, stirring ineffectual"
"7739",36,"tentacles, and moving feebly after their vast journey across space."

"7744",36,"and silent, eloquent lips. He wanted the slit, which permitted only one"

"7752",36,"jets of green vapour and working its way round the pit, excavating and"

"7754",36,"had caused the regular beating noise, and the rhythmic shocks that had"

"7771",36,"first the slightest suggestion of approach drove us into the scullery"
"7772",36,"in heart-throbbing retreat. Yet terrible as was the danger we incurred,"
"7773",36,"the attraction of peeping was for both of us irresistible. And I recall"
"7774",36,"now with a sort of wonder that, in spite of the infinite danger in"
"7775",36,"which we were between starvation and a still more terrible death, we"
"7776",36,"could yet struggle bitterly for that horrible privilege of sight. We"
"7777",36,"would race across the kitchen in a grotesque way between eagerness and"
"7778",36,"the dread of making a noise, and strike each other, and thrust and"
"7779",36,"kick, within a few inches of exposure."

"7781",36,"The fact is that we had absolutely incompatible dispositions and habits"

"7785",36,"His endless muttering monologue vitiated every effort I made to think"
"7786",36,"out a line of action, and drove me at times, thus pent up and"
"7787",36,"intensified, almost to the verge of craziness. He was as lacking in"
"7788",36,"restraint as a silly woman. He would weep for hours together, and I"
"7789",36,"verily believe that to the very end this spoiled child of life thought"
"7790",36,"his weak tears in some way efficacious. And I would sit in the darkness"
"7791",36,"unable to keep my mind off him by reason of his importunities. He ate"
"7792",36,"more than I did, and it was in vain I pointed out that our only chance"
"7793",36,"of life was to stop in the house until the Martians had done with their"
"7794",36,"pit, that in that long patience a time might presently come when we"
"7795",36,"should need food. He ate and drank impulsively in heavy meals at long"

"7815",36,"pitiless sunlight of that terrible June, was the strange wonder, the"
"7816",36,"unfamiliar routine of the Martians in the pit. Let me return to those"
"7817",36,"first new experiences of mine. After a long time I ventured back to the"
"7818",36,"peephole, to find that the new-comers had been reinforced by the"
"7819",36,"occupants of no fewer than three of the fighting-machines. These last"
"7820",36,"had brought with them certain fresh appliances that stood in an orderly"
"7821",36,"manner about the cylinder. The second handling-machine was now"
"7822",36,"completed, and was busied in serving one of the novel contrivances the"
"7823",36,"big machine had brought. This was a body resembling a milk can in its"
"7824",36,"general form, above which oscillated a pear-shaped receptacle, and from"
"7825",36,"which a stream of white powder flowed into a circular basin below."
"7826",36,""
"7827",36,"The oscillatory motion was imparted to this by one tentacle of the"
"7828",36,"handling-machine. With two spatulate hands the handling-machine was"
"7829",36,"digging out and flinging masses of clay into the pear-shaped receptacle"
"7830",36,"above, while with another arm it periodically opened a door and removed"
"7831",36,"rusty and blackened clinkers from the middle part of the machine."
"7832",36,"Another steely tentacle directed the powder from the basin along a"
"7833",36,"ribbed channel towards some receiver that was hidden from me by the"
"7834",36,"mound of bluish dust. From this unseen receiver a little thread of"
"7835",36,"green smoke rose vertically into the quiet air. As I looked, the"
"7836",36,"handling-machine, with a faint and musical clinking, extended,"
"7837",36,"telescopic fashion, a tentacle that had been a moment before a mere"
"7838",36,"blunt projection, until its end was hidden behind the mound of clay. In"
"7839",36,"another second it had lifted a bar of white aluminium into sight,"
"7840",36,"untarnished as yet, and shining dazzlingly, and deposited it in a"
"7841",36,"growing stack of bars that stood at the side of the pit. Between sunset"
"7842",36,"and starlight this dexterous machine must have made more than a hundred"
"7843",36,"such bars out of the crude clay, and the mound of bluish dust rose"
"7844",36,"steadily until it topped the side of the pit."

"7846",36,"The contrast between the swift and complex movements of these"

"7849",36,"were indeed the living of the two things."
"7850",36,""
"7851",36,"The curate had possession of the slit when the first men were brought"
"7852",36,"to the pit. I was sitting below, huddled up, listening with all my"
"7853",36,"ears. He made a sudden movement backward, and I, fearful that we were"
"7854",36,"observed, crouched in a spasm of terror. He came sliding down the"
"7855",36,"rubbish and crept beside me in the darkness, inarticulate,"
"7856",36,"gesticulating, and for a moment I shared his panic. His gesture"
"7857",36,"suggested a resignation of the slit, and after a little while my"
"7858",36,"curiosity gave me courage, and I rose up, stepped across him, and"
"7859",36,"clambered up to it. At first I could see no reason for his frantic"
"7860",36,"behaviour. The twilight had now come, the stars were little and faint,"
"7861",36,"but the pit was illuminated by the flickering green fire that came from"
"7862",36,"the aluminium-making. The whole picture was a flickering scheme of"
"7863",36,"green gleams and shifting rusty black shadows, strangely trying to the"
"7864",36,"eyes. Over and through it all went the bats, heeding it not at all. The"
"7865",36,"sprawling Martians were no longer to be seen, the mound of blue-green"
"7866",36,"powder had risen to cover them from sight, and a fighting-machine, with"
"7867",36,"its legs contracted, crumpled, and abbreviated, stood across the corner"
"7868",36,"of the pit. And then, amid the clangour of the machinery, came a"
"7869",36,"drifting suspicion of human voices, that I entertained at first only to"
"7870",36,"dismiss."
"7871",36,""
"7872",36,"I crouched, watching this fighting-machine closely, satisfying myself"
"7873",36,"now for the first time that the hood did indeed contain a Martian. As"
"7874",36,"the green flames lifted I could see the oily gleam of his integument"
"7875",36,"and the brightness of his eyes. And suddenly I heard a yell, and saw a"
"7876",36,"long tentacle reaching over the shoulder of the machine to the little"
"7877",36,"cage that hunched upon its back. Then something—something struggling"
"7878",36,"violently—was lifted high against the sky, a black, vague enigma"
"7879",36,"against the starlight; and as this black object came down again, I saw"
"7880",36,"by the green brightness that it was a man. For an instant he was"
"7881",36,"clearly visible. He was a stout, ruddy, middle-aged man, well dressed;"
"7882",36,"three days before, he must have been walking the world, a man of"
"7883",36,"considerable consequence. I could see his staring eyes and gleams of"
"7884",36,"light on his studs and watch chain. He vanished behind the mound, and"
"7885",36,"for a moment there was silence. And then began a shrieking and a"
"7886",36,"sustained and cheerful hooting from the Martians."
"7887",36,""
"7888",36,"I slid down the rubbish, struggled to my feet, clapped my hands over my"
"7889",36,"ears, and bolted into the scullery. The curate, who had been crouching"
"7890",36,"silently with his arms over his head, looked up as I passed, cried out"
"7891",36,"quite loudly at my desertion of him, and came running after me."
"7892",36,""
"7893",36,"That night, as we lurked in the scullery, balanced between our horror"
"7894",36,"and the terrible fascination this peeping had, although I felt an"
"7895",36,"urgent need of action I tried in vain to conceive some plan of escape;"
"7896",36,"but afterwards, during the second day, I was able to consider our"
"7897",36,"position with great clearness. The curate, I found, was quite incapable"
"7898",36,"of discussion; this new and culminating atrocity had robbed him of all"
"7899",36,"vestiges of reason or forethought. Practically he had already sunk to"
"7900",36,"the level of an animal. But as the saying goes, I gripped myself with"
"7901",36,"both hands. It grew upon my mind, once I could face the facts, that"
"7902",36,"terrible as our position was, there was as yet no justification for"
"7903",36,"absolute despair. Our chief chance lay in the possibility of the"
"7904",36,"Martians making the pit nothing more than a temporary encampment. Or"
"7905",36,"even if they kept it permanently, they might not consider it necessary"
"7906",36,"to guard it, and a chance of escape might be afforded us. I also"
"7907",36,"weighed very carefully the possibility of our digging a way out in a"
"7908",36,"direction away from the pit, but the chances of our emerging within"
"7909",36,"sight of some sentinel fighting-machine seemed at first too great. And"
"7910",36,"I should have had to do all the digging myself. The curate would"
"7911",36,"certainly have failed me."

"7916",36,"the better part of a day. I went into the scullery, removed the door,"
"7917",36,"and spent some hours digging with my hatchet as silently as possible;"
"7918",36,"but when I had made a hole about a couple of feet deep the loose earth"

"7960",36,"him of my determination to begin a discipline. I divided the food in"
"7961",36,"the pantry, into rations to last us ten days. I would not let him eat"
"7962",36,"any more that day. In the afternoon he made a feeble effort to get at"
"7963",36,"the food. I had been dozing, but in an instant I was awake. All day and"
"7964",36,"all night we sat face to face, I weary but resolute, and he weeping and"
"7965",36,"complaining of his immediate hunger. It was, I know, a night and a day,"
"7966",36,"but to me it seemed—it seems now—an interminable length of time."
"7967",36,""
"7968",36,"And so our widened incompatibility ended at last in open conflict. For"
"7969",36,"two vast days we struggled in undertones and wrestling contests. There"
"7970",36,"were times when I beat and kicked him madly, times when I cajoled and"
"7971",36,"persuaded him, and once I tried to bribe him with the last bottle of"
"7972",36,"burgundy, for there was a rain-water pump from which I could get water."
"7973",36,"But neither force nor kindness availed; he was indeed beyond reason. He"
"7974",36,"would neither desist from his attacks on the food nor from his noisy"
"7975",36,"babbling to himself. The rudimentary precautions to keep our"
"7976",36,"imprisonment endurable he would not observe. Slowly I began to realise"
"7977",36,"the complete overthrow of his intelligence, to perceive that my sole"
"7978",36,"companion in this close and sickly darkness was a man insane."
"7979",36,""
"7980",36,"From certain vague memories I am inclined to think my own mind wandered"
"7981",36,"at times. I had strange and hideous dreams whenever I slept. It sounds"
"7982",36,"paradoxical, but I am inclined to think that the weakness and insanity"
"7983",36,"of the curate warned me, braced me, and kept me a sane man."
"7984",36,""
"7985",36,"On the eighth day he began to talk aloud instead of whispering, and"
"7986",36,"nothing I could do would moderate his speech."
"7987",36,""
"7988",36,"“It is just, O God!” he would say, over and over again. “It is just. On"
"7989",36,"me and mine be the punishment laid. We have sinned, we have fallen"
"7990",36,"short. There was poverty, sorrow; the poor were trodden in the dust,"
"7991",36,"and I held my peace. I preached acceptable folly—my God, what"
"7992",36,"folly!—when I should have stood up, though I died for it, and called"
"7993",36,"upon them to repent—repent! . . . Oppressors of the poor and needy . ."
"7994",36,". ! The wine press of God!”"
"7995",36,""
"7996",36,"Then he would suddenly revert to the matter of the food I withheld from"
"7997",36,"him, praying, begging, weeping, at last threatening. He began to raise"
"7998",36,"his voice—I prayed him not to. He perceived a hold on me—he threatened"
"7999",36,"he would shout and bring the Martians upon us. For a time that scared"
"8000",36,"me; but any concession would have shortened our chance of escape beyond"
"8001",36,"estimating. I defied him, although I felt no assurance that he might"
"8002",36,"not do this thing. But that day, at any rate, he did not. He talked"
"8003",36,"with his voice rising slowly, through the greater part of the eighth"
"8004",36,"and ninth days—threats, entreaties, mingled with a torrent of half-sane"
"8005",36,"and always frothy repentance for his vacant sham of God’s service, such"
"8006",36,"as made me pity him. Then he slept awhile, and began again with renewed"
"8007",36,"strength, so loudly that I must needs make him desist."
"8008",36,""
"8009",36,"“Be still!” I implored."
"8010",36,""
"8011",36,"He rose to his knees, for he had been sitting in the darkness near the"
"8012",36,"copper."
"8013",36,""
"8014",36,"“I have been still too long,” he said, in a tone that must have reached"
"8015",36,"the pit, “and now I must bear my witness. Woe unto this unfaithful"
"8016",36,"city! Woe! Woe! Woe! Woe! Woe! To the inhabitants of the earth by"
"8017",36,"reason of the other voices of the trumpet——”"
"8018",36,""
"8019",36,"“Shut up!” I said, rising to my feet, and in a terror lest the Martians"
"8020",36,"should hear us. “For God’s sake——”"
"8021",36,""
"8022",36,"“Nay,” shouted the curate, at the top of his voice, standing likewise"
"8023",36,"and extending his arms. “Speak! The word of the Lord is upon me!”"
"8024",36,""
"8025",36,"In three strides he was at the door leading into the kitchen."

"8027",36,"“I must bear my witness! I go! It has already been too long delayed.”"
"8028",36,""
"8029",36,"I put out my hand and felt the meat chopper hanging to the wall. In a"
"8030",36,"flash I was after him. I was fierce with fear. Before he was halfway"
"8031",36,"across the kitchen I had overtaken him. With one last touch of humanity"
"8032",36,"I turned the blade back and struck him with the butt. He went headlong"
"8033",36,"forward and lay stretched on the ground. I stumbled over him and stood"
"8034",36,"panting. He lay still."

"8036",36,"Suddenly I heard a noise without, the run and smash of slipping"

"8039",36,"the hole. One of its gripping limbs curled amid the debris; another"
"8040",36,"limb appeared, feeling its way over the fallen beams. I stood"
"8041",36,"petrified, staring. Then I saw through a sort of glass plate near the"
"8042",36,"edge of the body the face, as we may call it, and the large dark eyes"
"8043",36,"of a Martian, peering, and then a long metallic snake of tentacle came"
"8044",36,"feeling slowly through the hole."
"8045",36,""
"8046",36,"I turned by an effort, stumbled over the curate, and stopped at the"
"8047",36,"scullery door. The tentacle was now some way, two yards or more, in the"
"8048",36,"room, and twisting and turning, with queer sudden movements, this way"
"8049",36,"and that. For a while I stood fascinated by that slow, fitful advance."
"8050",36,"Then, with a faint, hoarse cry, I forced myself across the scullery. I"
"8051",36,"trembled violently; I could scarcely stand upright. I opened the door"
"8052",36,"of the coal cellar, and stood there in the darkness staring at the"
"8053",36,"faintly lit doorway into the kitchen, and listening. Had the Martian"
"8054",36,"seen me? What was it doing now?"
"8055",36,""
"8056",36,"Something was moving to and fro there, very quietly; every now and then"
"8057",36,"it tapped against the wall, or started on its movements with a faint"
"8058",36,"metallic ringing, like the movements of keys on a split-ring. Then a"
"8059",36,"heavy body—I knew too well what—was dragged across the floor of the"
"8060",36,"kitchen towards the opening. Irresistibly attracted, I crept to the"
"8061",36,"door and peeped into the kitchen. In the triangle of bright outer"
"8062",36,"sunlight I saw the Martian, in its Briareus of a handling-machine,"
"8063",36,"scrutinizing the curate’s head. I thought at once that it would infer"
"8064",36,"my presence from the mark of the blow I had given him."
"8065",36,""
"8066",36,"I crept back to the coal cellar, shut the door, and began to cover"
"8067",36,"myself up as much as I could, and as noiselessly as possible in the"
"8068",36,"darkness, among the firewood and coal therein. Every now and then I"
"8069",36,"paused, rigid, to hear if the Martian had thrust its tentacles through"
"8070",36,"the opening again."
"8071",36,""
"8072",36,"Then the faint metallic jingle returned. I traced it slowly feeling"
"8073",36,"over the kitchen. Presently I heard it nearer—in the scullery, as I"
"8074",36,"judged. I thought that its length might be insufficient to reach me. I"
"8075",36,"prayed copiously. It passed, scraping faintly across the cellar door."
"8076",36,"An age of almost intolerable suspense intervened; then I heard it"
"8077",36,"fumbling at the latch! It had found the door! The Martians understood"
"8078",36,"doors!"

"8080",36,"It worried at the catch for a minute, perhaps, and then the door"

"8086",36,"blind head to and fro."
"8087",36,""
"8088",36,"Once, even, it touched the heel of my boot. I was on the verge of"
"8089",36,"screaming; I bit my hand. For a time the tentacle was silent. I could"
"8090",36,"have fancied it had been withdrawn. Presently, with an abrupt click, it"
"8091",36,"gripped something—I thought it had me!—and seemed to go out of the"

"8140",36,"tainted rain water. I was greatly refreshed by this, and emboldened by"
"8141",36,"the fact that no enquiring tentacle followed the noise of my pumping."

"8256",36,"of garden ground unburied. This gave me a hint, and I went knee-deep,"
"8257",36,"and sometimes neck-deep, in the red weed. The density of the weed gave"
"8258",36,"me a reassuring sense of hiding. The wall was some six feet high, and"
"8259",36,"when I attempted to clamber it I found I could not lift my feet to the"
"8260",36,"crest. So I went along by the side of it, and came to a corner and a"

"8263",36,"and a quantity of immature carrots, all of which I secured, and,"
"8264",36,"scrambling over a ruined wall, went on my way through scarlet and"
"8265",36,"crimson trees towards Kew—it was like walking through an avenue of"
"8266",36,"gigantic blood drops—possessed with two ideas: to get more food, and to"
"8267",36,"limp, as soon and as far as my strength permitted, out of this accursed"

"8273",36,"only to whet my hunger. At first I was surprised at this flood in a"
"8274",36,"hot, dry summer, but afterwards I discovered that it was caused by the"
"8275",36,"tropical exuberance of the red weed. Directly this extraordinary growth"
"8276",36,"encountered water it straightway became gigantic and of unparalleled"
"8277",36,"fecundity. Its seeds were simply poured down into the water of the Wey"

"8279",36,"choked both those rivers."

"8281",36,"At Putney, as I afterwards saw, the bridge was almost lost in a tangle"

"8310",36,"Here the scenery changed from the strange and unfamiliar to the"
"8311",36,"wreckage of the familiar: patches of ground exhibited the devastation"
"8312",36,"of a cyclone, and in a few score yards I would come upon perfectly"
"8313",36,"undisturbed spaces, houses with their blinds trimly drawn and doors"
"8314",36,"closed, as if they had been left for a day by the owners, or as if"
"8315",36,"their inhabitants slept within. The red weed was less abundant; the"
"8316",36,"tall trees along the lane were free from the red creeper. I hunted for"
"8317",36,"food among the trees, finding nothing, and I also raided a couple of"
"8318",36,"silent houses, but they had already been broken into and ransacked. I"
"8319",36,"rested for the remainder of the daylight in a shrubbery, being, in my"
"8320",36,"enfeebled condition, too fatigued to push on."
"8321",36,""
"8322",36,"All this time I saw no human beings, and no signs of the Martians. I"
"8323",36,"encountered a couple of hungry-looking dogs, but both hurried"
"8324",36,"circuitously away from the advances I made them. Near Roehampton I had"
"8325",36,"seen two human skeletons—not bodies, but skeletons, picked clean—and in"
"8326",36,"the wood by me I found the crushed and scattered bones of several cats"
"8327",36,"and rabbits and the skull of a sheep. But though I gnawed parts of"
"8328",36,"these in my mouth, there was nothing to be got from them."
"8329",36,""
"8330",36,"After sunset I struggled on along the road towards Putney, where I"
"8331",36,"think the Heat-Ray must have been used for some reason. And in the"
"8332",36,"garden beyond Roehampton I got a quantity of immature potatoes,"
"8333",36,"sufficient to stay my hunger. From this garden one looked down upon"
"8334",36,"Putney and the river. The aspect of the place in the dusk was"
"8335",36,"singularly desolate: blackened trees, blackened, desolate ruins, and"
"8336",36,"down the hill the sheets of the flooded river, red-tinged with the"
"8337",36,"weed. And over all—silence. It filled me with indescribable terror to"
"8338",36,"think how swiftly that desolating change had come."
"8339",36,""
"8340",36,"For a time I believed that mankind had been swept out of existence, and"
"8341",36,"that I stood there alone, the last man left alive. Hard by the top of"
"8342",36,"Putney Hill I came upon another skeleton, with the arms dislocated and"
"8343",36,"removed several yards from the rest of the body. As I proceeded I"
"8344",36,"became more and more convinced that the extermination of mankind was,"
"8345",36,"save for such stragglers as myself, already accomplished in this part"
"8346",36,"of the world. The Martians, I thought, had gone on and left the country"
"8347",36,"desolated, seeking food elsewhere. Perhaps even now they were"
"8348",36,"destroying Berlin or Paris, or it might be they had gone northward."

"8354",36,"THE MAN ON PUTNEY HILL."
"8355",36,""
"8356",36,""
"8357",36,"I spent that night in the inn that stands at the top of Putney Hill,"
"8358",36,"sleeping in a made bed for the first time since my flight to"
"8359",36,"Leatherhead. I will not tell the needless trouble I had breaking into"
"8360",36,"that house—afterwards I found the front door was on the latch—nor how I"
"8361",36,"ransacked every room for food, until just on the verge of despair, in"
"8362",36,"what seemed to me to be a servant’s bedroom, I found a rat-gnawed crust"
"8363",36,"and two tins of pineapple. The place had been already searched and"
"8364",36,"emptied. In the bar I afterwards found some biscuits and sandwiches"
"8365",36,"that had been overlooked. The latter I could not eat, they were too"
"8366",36,"rotten, but the former not only stayed my hunger, but filled my"
"8367",36,"pockets. I lit no lamps, fearing some Martian might come beating that"
"8368",36,"part of London for food in the night. Before I went to bed I had an"
"8369",36,"interval of restlessness, and prowled from window to window, peering"
"8370",36,"out for some sign of these monsters. I slept little. As I lay in bed I"
"8371",36,"found myself thinking consecutively—a thing I do not remember to have"
"8372",36,"done since my last argument with the curate. During all the intervening"
"8373",36,"time my mental condition had been a hurrying succession of vague"
"8374",36,"emotional states or a sort of stupid receptivity. But in the night my"
"8375",36,"brain, reinforced, I suppose, by the food I had eaten, grew clear"
"8376",36,"again, and I thought."
"8377",36,""
"8378",36,"Three things struggled for possession of my mind: the killing of the"
"8379",36,"curate, the whereabouts of the Martians, and the possible fate of my"
"8380",36,"wife. The former gave me no sensation of horror or remorse to recall; I"
"8381",36,"saw it simply as a thing done, a memory infinitely disagreeable but"
"8382",36,"quite without the quality of remorse. I saw myself then as I see myself"
"8383",36,"now, driven step by step towards that hasty blow, the creature of a"
"8384",36,"sequence of accidents leading inevitably to that. I felt no"
"8385",36,"condemnation; yet the memory, static, unprogressive, haunted me. In the"
"8386",36,"silence of the night, with that sense of the nearness of God that"
"8387",36,"sometimes comes into the stillness and the darkness, I stood my trial,"
"8388",36,"my only trial, for that moment of wrath and fear. I retraced every step"
"8389",36,"of our conversation from the moment when I had found him crouching"
"8390",36,"beside me, heedless of my thirst, and pointing to the fire and smoke"
"8391",36,"that streamed up from the ruins of Weybridge. We had been incapable of"
"8392",36,"co-operation—grim chance had taken no heed of that. Had I foreseen, I"
"8393",36,"should have left him at Halliford. But I did not foresee; and crime is"
"8394",36,"to foresee and do. And I set this down as I have set all this story"
"8395",36,"down, as it was. There were no witnesses—all these things I might have"
"8396",36,"concealed. But I set it down, and the reader must form his judgment as"
"8397",36,"he will."
"8398",36,""
"8399",36,"And when, by an effort, I had set aside that picture of a prostrate"
"8400",36,"body, I faced the problem of the Martians and the fate of my wife. For"
"8401",36,"the former I had no data; I could imagine a hundred things, and so,"
"8402",36,"unhappily, I could for the latter. And suddenly that night became"
"8403",36,"terrible. I found myself sitting up in bed, staring at the dark. I"
"8404",36,"found myself praying that the Heat-Ray might have suddenly and"
"8405",36,"painlessly struck her out of being. Since the night of my return from"
"8406",36,"Leatherhead I had not prayed. I had uttered prayers, fetish prayers,"
"8407",36,"had prayed as heathens mutter charms when I was in extremity; but now I"
"8408",36,"prayed indeed, pleading steadfastly and sanely, face to face with the"
"8409",36,"darkness of God. Strange night! Strangest in this, that so soon as dawn"
"8410",36,"had come, I, who had talked with God, crept out of the house like a rat"
"8411",36,"leaving its hiding place—a creature scarcely larger, an inferior"
"8412",36,"animal, a thing that for any passing whim of our masters might be"
"8413",36,"hunted and killed. Perhaps they also prayed confidently to God. Surely,"
"8414",36,"if we have learned nothing else, this war has taught us pity—pity for"
"8415",36,"those witless souls that suffer our dominion."
"8416",36,""
"8417",36,"The morning was bright and fine, and the eastern sky glowed pink, and"
"8418",36,"was fretted with little golden clouds. In the road that runs from the"
"8419",36,"top of Putney Hill to Wimbledon was a number of poor vestiges of the"
"8420",36,"panic torrent that must have poured Londonward on the Sunday night"
"8421",36,"after the fighting began. There was a little two-wheeled cart inscribed"
"8422",36,"with the name of Thomas Lobb, Greengrocer, New Malden, with a smashed"
"8423",36,"wheel and an abandoned tin trunk; there was a straw hat trampled into"
"8424",36,"the now hardened mud, and at the top of West Hill a lot of"
"8425",36,"blood-stained glass about the overturned water trough. My movements"
"8426",36,"were languid, my plans of the vaguest. I had an idea of going to"
"8427",36,"Leatherhead, though I knew that there I had the poorest chance of"
"8428",36,"finding my wife. Certainly, unless death had overtaken them suddenly,"
"8429",36,"my cousins and she would have fled thence; but it seemed to me I might"
"8430",36,"find or learn there whither the Surrey people had fled. I knew I wanted"
"8431",36,"to find my wife, that my heart ached for her and the world of men, but"
"8432",36,"I had no clear idea how the finding might be done. I was also sharply"
"8433",36,"aware now of my intense loneliness. From the corner I went, under cover"
"8434",36,"of a thicket of trees and bushes, to the edge of Wimbledon Common,"
"8435",36,"stretching wide and far."
"8436",36,""
"8437",36,"That dark expanse was lit in patches by yellow gorse and broom; there"
"8438",36,"was no red weed to be seen, and as I prowled, hesitating, on the verge"
"8439",36,"of the open, the sun rose, flooding it all with light and vitality. I"
"8440",36,"came upon a busy swarm of little frogs in a swampy place among the"
"8441",36,"trees. I stopped to look at them, drawing a lesson from their stout"
"8442",36,"resolve to live. And presently, turning suddenly, with an odd feeling"
"8443",36,"of being watched, I beheld something crouching amid a clump of bushes."
"8444",36,"I stood regarding this. I made a step towards it, and it rose up and"
"8445",36,"became a man armed with a cutlass. I approached him slowly. He stood"
"8446",36,"silent and motionless, regarding me."
"8447",36,""
"8448",36,"As I drew nearer I perceived he was dressed in clothes as dusty and"
"8449",36,"filthy as my own; he looked, indeed, as though he had been dragged"
"8450",36,"through a culvert. Nearer, I distinguished the green slime of ditches"
"8451",36,"mixing with the pale drab of dried clay and shiny, coaly patches. His"
"8452",36,"black hair fell over his eyes, and his face was dark and dirty and"
"8453",36,"sunken, so that at first I did not recognise him. There was a red cut"
"8454",36,"across the lower part of his face."
"8455",36,""
"8456",36,"“Stop!” he cried, when I was within ten yards of him, and I stopped."

"8501",36,"you can just see them moving. By daylight you can’t. But nearer—I"
"8502",36,"haven’t seen them—” (he counted on his fingers) “five days. Then I saw"
"8503",36,"a couple across Hammersmith way carrying something big. And the night"
"8504",36,"before last”—he stopped and spoke impressively—“it was just a matter of"
"8505",36,"lights, but it was something up in the air. I believe they’ve built a"

"8668",36,"back streets, and sleeping with the wives they married, not because"
"8669",36,"they wanted them, but because they had a bit of money that would make"
"8670",36,"for safety in their one little miserable skedaddle through the world."

"8674",36,"fattening food, careful breeding, no worry. After a week or so chasing"
"8675",36,"about the fields and lands on empty stomachs, they’ll come and be"
"8676",36,"caught cheerful. They’ll be quite glad after a bit. They’ll wonder what"
"8677",36,"people did before there were Martians to take care of them. And the bar"
"8678",36,"loafers, and mashers, and singers—I can imagine them. I can imagine"
"8679",36,"them,” he said, with a sort of sombre gratification. “There’ll be any"
"8680",36,"amount of sentiment and religion loose among them. There’s hundreds of"
"8681",36,"things I saw with my eyes that I’ve only begun to see clearly these"

"8683",36,"stupid; and lots will be worried by a sort of feeling that it’s all"
"8684",36,"wrong, and that they ought to be doing something. Now whenever things"
"8685",36,"are so that a lot of people feel they ought to be doing something, the"
"8686",36,"weak, and those who go weak with a lot of complicated thinking, always"
"8687",36,"make for a sort of do-nothing religion, very pious and superior, and"
"8688",36,"submit to persecution and the will of the Lord. Very likely you’ve seen"
"8689",36,"the same thing. It’s energy in a gale of funk, and turned clean inside"
"8690",36,"out. These cages will be full of psalms and hymns and piety. And those"
"8691",36,"of a less simple sort will work in a bit of—what is it?—eroticism.”"

"8693",36,"He paused."

"8733",36,"stores, from which bolting passages may be made to the drains. And the"
"8734",36,"railway tunnels and subways. Eh? You begin to see? And we form a"
"8735",36,"band—able-bodied, clean-minded men. We’re not going to pick up any"

"8749",36,"to live and taint the race. And they can’t be happy. Moreover, dying’s"
"8750",36,"none so dreadful; it’s the funking makes it bad. And in all those"

"8783",36,""
"8784",36,"For a while the imaginative daring of the artilleryman, and the tone of"

"8786",36,"believed unhesitatingly both in his forecast of human destiny and in"
"8787",36,"the practicability of his astonishing scheme, and the reader who thinks"
"8788",36,"me susceptible and foolish must contrast his position, reading steadily"
"8789",36,"with all his thoughts about his subject, and mine, crouching fearfully"
"8790",36,"in the bushes and listening, distracted by apprehension. We talked in"
"8791",36,"this manner through the early morning time, and later crept out of the"
"8792",36,"bushes, and, after scanning the sky for Martians, hurried precipitately"
"8793",36,"to the house on Putney Hill where he had made his lair. It was the coal"
"8794",36,"cellar of the place, and when I saw the work he had spent a week"
"8795",36,"upon—it was a burrow scarcely ten yards long, which he designed to"
"8796",36,"reach to the main drain on Putney Hill—I had my first inkling of the"
"8797",36,"gulf between his dreams and his powers. Such a hole I could have dug in"
"8798",36,"a day. But I believed in him sufficiently to work with him all that"
"8799",36,"morning until past midday at his digging. We had a garden barrow and"
"8800",36,"shot the earth we removed against the kitchen range. We refreshed"
"8801",36,"ourselves with a tin of mock-turtle soup and wine from the neighbouring"
"8802",36,"pantry. I found a curious relief from the aching strangeness of the"
"8803",36,"world in this steady labour. As we worked, I turned his project over in"
"8804",36,"my mind, and presently objections and doubts began to arise; but I"
"8805",36,"worked there all the morning, so glad was I to find myself with a"
"8806",36,"purpose again. After working an hour I began to speculate on the"
"8807",36,"distance one had to go before the cloaca was reached, the chances we"
"8808",36,"had of missing it altogether. My immediate trouble was why we should"
"8809",36,"dig this long tunnel, when it was possible to get into the drain at"
"8810",36,"once down one of the manholes, and work back to the house. It seemed to"
"8811",36,"me, too, that the house was inconveniently chosen, and required a"
"8812",36,"needless length of tunnel. And just as I was beginning to face these"
"8813",36,"things, the artilleryman stopped digging, and looked at me."
"8814",36,""
"8815",36,"“We’re working well,” he said. He put down his spade. “Let us knock off"

"8817",36,"house.”"
"8818",36,""
"8819",36,"I was for going on, and after a little hesitation he resumed his spade;"

"8830",36,"“Oh, one can’t always work,” he said, and in a flash I saw the man"
"8831",36,"plain. He hesitated, holding his spade. “We ought to reconnoitre now,”"

"8833",36,"upon us unawares.”"
"8834",36,""
"8835",36,"I was no longer disposed to object. We went together to the roof and"

"8838",36,"of the parapet."

"8843",36,"about the old palace, and their branches stretched gaunt and dead, and"
"8844",36,"set with shrivelled leaves, from amid its clusters. It was strange how"
"8845",36,"entirely dependent both these things were upon flowing water for their"
"8846",36,"propagation. About us neither had gained a footing; laburnums, pink"
"8847",36,"mays, snowballs, and trees of arbor-vitae, rose out of laurels and"
"8848",36,"hydrangeas, green and brilliant into the sunlight. Beyond Kensington"

"8858",36,"till dawn. A man who was there told me. And as the day came they became"
"8859",36,"aware of a fighting-machine standing near by the Langham and looking"
"8860",36,"down at them. Heaven knows how long he had been there. It must have"
"8861",36,"given some of them a nasty turn. He came down the road towards them,"

"8868",36,"possibility of capturing a fighting-machine that I more than half"
"8869",36,"believed in him again. But now that I was beginning to understand"
"8870",36,"something of his quality, I could divine the stress he laid on doing"
"8871",36,"nothing precipitately. And I noted that now there was no question that"

"8890",36,"between us, I taking the northern side and he the southern, we played"
"8891",36,"for parish points. Grotesque and foolish as this will seem to the sober"

"8898",36,"chance of this painted pasteboard, and playing the “joker” with vivid"

"8906",36,"morning. He was still optimistic, but it was a less kinetic, a more"
"8907",36,"thoughtful optimism. I remember he wound up with my health, proposed in"
"8908",36,"a speech of small variety and considerable intermittence. I took a"

"8989",36,"In South Kensington the streets were clear of dead and of black powder."
"8990",36,"It was near South Kensington that I first heard the howling. It crept"
"8991",36,"almost imperceptibly upon my senses. It was a sobbing alternation of"
"8992",36,"two notes, “Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,” keeping on perpetually. When I"
"8993",36,"passed streets that ran northward it grew in volume, and houses and"
"8994",36,"buildings seemed to deaden and cut it off again. It came in a full tide"
"8995",36,"down Exhibition Road. I stopped, staring towards Kensington Gardens,"
"8996",36,"wondering at this strange, remote wailing. It was as if that mighty"
"8997",36,"desert of houses had found a voice for its fear and solitude."
"8998",36,""
"8999",36,"“Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,” wailed that superhuman note—great waves of"
"9000",36,"sound sweeping down the broad, sunlit roadway, between the tall"
"9001",36,"buildings on each side. I turned northwards, marvelling, towards the"
"9002",36,"iron gates of Hyde Park. I had half a mind to break into the Natural"
"9003",36,"History Museum and find my way up to the summits of the towers, in"
"9004",36,"order to see across the park. But I decided to keep to the ground,"
"9005",36,"where quick hiding was possible, and so went on up the Exhibition Road."
"9006",36,"All the large mansions on each side of the road were empty and still,"
"9007",36,"and my footsteps echoed against the sides of the houses. At the top,"
"9008",36,"near the park gate, I came upon a strange sight—a bus overturned, and"
"9009",36,"the skeleton of a horse picked clean. I puzzled over this for a time,"
"9010",36,"and then went on to the bridge over the Serpentine. The voice grew"
"9011",36,"stronger and stronger, though I could see nothing above the housetops"
"9012",36,"on the north side of the park, save a haze of smoke to the northwest."
"9013",36,""
"9014",36,"“Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,” cried the voice, coming, as it seemed to me,"
"9015",36,"from the district about Regent’s Park. The desolating cry worked upon"
"9016",36,"my mind. The mood that had sustained me passed. The wailing took"
"9017",36,"possession of me. I found I was intensely weary, footsore, and now"
"9018",36,"again hungry and thirsty."
"9019",36,""
"9020",36,"It was already past noon. Why was I wandering alone in this city of the"
"9021",36,"dead? Why was I alone when all London was lying in state, and in its"
"9022",36,"black shroud? I felt intolerably lonely. My mind ran on old friends"
"9023",36,"that I had forgotten for years. I thought of the poisons in the"
"9024",36,"chemists’ shops, of the liquors the wine merchants stored; I recalled"
"9025",36,"the two sodden creatures of despair, who so far as I knew, shared the"
"9026",36,"city with myself. . . ."

"9028",36,"I came into Oxford Street by the Marble Arch, and here again were black"
"9029",36,"powder and several bodies, and an evil, ominous smell from the gratings"
"9030",36,"of the cellars of some of the houses. I grew very thirsty after the"
"9031",36,"heat of my long walk. With infinite trouble I managed to break into a"
"9032",36,"public-house and get food and drink. I was weary after eating, and went"
"9033",36,"into the parlour behind the bar, and slept on a black horsehair sofa I"
"9034",36,"found there."
"9035",36,""
"9036",36,"I awoke to find that dismal howling still in my ears, “Ulla, ulla,"

"9038",36,"and a cheese in the bar—there was a meat safe, but it contained nothing"
"9039",36,"but maggots—I wandered on through the silent residential squares to"
"9040",36,"Baker Street—Portman Square is the only one I can name—and so came out"
"9041",36,"at last upon Regent’s Park. And as I emerged from the top of Baker"
"9042",36,"Street, I saw far away over the trees in the clearness of the sunset"
"9043",36,"the hood of the Martian giant from which this howling proceeded. I was"
"9044",36,"not terrified. I came upon him as if it were a matter of course. I"
"9045",36,"watched him for some time, but he did not move. He appeared to be"
"9046",36,"standing and yelling, for no reason that I could discover."

"9051",36,"monotonous crying than afraid. I turned back away from the park and"
"9052",36,"struck into Park Road, intending to skirt the park, went along under"
"9053",36,"the shelter of the terraces, and got a view of this stationary, howling"
"9054",36,"Martian from the direction of St. John’s Wood. A couple of hundred"
"9055",36,"yards out of Baker Street I heard a yelping chorus, and saw, first a"
"9056",36,"dog with a piece of putrescent red meat in his jaws coming headlong"
"9057",36,"towards me, and then a pack of starving mongrels in pursuit of him. He"
"9058",36,"made a wide curve to avoid me, as though he feared I might prove a"
"9059",36,"fresh competitor. As the yelping died away down the silent road, the"
"9060",36,"wailing sound of “Ulla, ulla, ulla, ulla,” reasserted itself."

"9062",36,"I came upon the wrecked handling-machine halfway to St. John’s Wood"

"9064",36,"only as I clambered among the ruins that I saw, with a start, this"
"9065",36,"mechanical Samson lying, with its tentacles bent and smashed and"
"9066",36,"twisted, among the ruins it had made. The forepart was shattered. It"
"9067",36,"seemed as if it had driven blindly straight at the house, and had been"
"9068",36,"overwhelmed in its overthrow. It seemed to me then that this might have"
"9069",36,"happened by a handling-machine escaping from the guidance of its"
"9070",36,"Martian. I could not clamber among the ruins to see it, and the"
"9071",36,"twilight was now so far advanced that the blood with which its seat was"
"9072",36,"smeared, and the gnawed gristle of the Martian that the dogs had left,"
"9073",36,"were invisible to me."

"9078",36,"Zoological Gardens, and silent. A little beyond the ruins about the"
"9079",36,"smashed handling-machine I came upon the red weed again, and found the"
"9080",36,"Regent’s Canal, a spongy mass of dark-red vegetation."

"9087",36,"clambered among the ruins, writhing to get above me in the dimness."
"9088",36,"Night, the mother of fear and mystery, was coming upon me. But while"
"9089",36,"that voice sounded the solitude, the desolation, had been endurable; by"
"9090",36,"virtue of it London had still seemed alive, and the sense of life about"
"9091",36,"me had upheld me. Then suddenly a change, the passing of something—I"
"9092",36,"knew not what—and then a stillness that could be felt. Nothing but this"
"9093",36,"gaunt quiet."
"9094",36,""
"9095",36,"London about me gazed at me spectrally. The windows in the white houses"

"9097",36,"thousand noiseless enemies moving. Terror seized me, a horror of my"
"9098",36,"temerity. In front of me the road became pitchy black as though it was"
"9099",36,"tarred, and I saw a contorted shape lying across the pathway. I could"
"9100",36,"not bring myself to go on. I turned down St. John’s Wood Road, and ran"
"9101",36,"headlong from this unendurable stillness towards Kilburn. I hid from"
"9102",36,"the night and the silence, until long after midnight, in a cabmen’s"
"9103",36,"shelter in Harrow Road. But before the dawn my courage returned, and"
"9104",36,"while the stars were still in the sky I turned once more towards"
"9105",36,"Regent’s Park. I missed my way among the streets, and presently saw"
"9106",36,"down a long avenue, in the half-light of the early dawn, the curve of"

"9113",36,"saw that a multitude of black birds was circling and clustering about"
"9114",36,"the hood. At that my heart gave a bound, and I began running along the"

"9121",36,"crest of the hill, making a huge redoubt of it—it was the final and"
"9122",36,"largest place the Martians had made—and from behind these heaps there"
"9123",36,"rose a thin smoke against the sky. Against the sky line an eager dog"
"9124",36,"ran and disappeared. The thought that had flashed into my mind grew"
"9125",36,"real, grew credible. I felt no fear, only a wild, trembling exultation,"
"9126",36,"as I ran up the hill towards the motionless monster. Out of the hood"
"9127",36,"hung lank shreds of brown, at which the hungry birds pecked and tore."

"9132",36,"material and strange shelter places. And scattered about it, some in"
"9133",36,"their overturned war-machines, some in the now rigid handling-machines,"

"9140",36,"For so it had come about, as indeed I and many men might have foreseen"

"9142",36,"have taken toll of humanity since the beginning of things—taken toll of"
"9143",36,"our prehuman ancestors since life began here. But by virtue of this"
"9144",36,"natural selection of our kind we have developed resisting power; to no"
"9145",36,"germs do we succumb without a struggle, and to many—those that cause"
"9146",36,"putrefaction in dead matter, for instance—our living frames are"
"9147",36,"altogether immune. But there are no bacteria in Mars, and directly"
"9148",36,"these invaders arrived, directly they drank and fed, our microscopic"
"9149",36,"allies began to work their overthrow. Already when I watched them they"
"9150",36,"were irrevocably doomed, dying and rotting even as they went to and"
"9151",36,"fro. It was inevitable. By the toll of a billion deaths man has bought"
"9152",36,"his birthright of the earth, and it is his against all comers; it would"

"9159",36,"this death was incomprehensible. All I knew was that these things that"
"9160",36,"had been alive and so terrible to men were dead. For a moment I"
"9161",36,"believed that the destruction of Sennacherib had been repeated, that"
"9162",36,"God had repented, that the Angel of Death had slain them in the night."

"9314",36,"red weed, transfixed by a stick that kept it in place. It was the"
"9315",36,"placard of the first newspaper to resume publication—the _Daily Mail_."
"9316",36,"I bought a copy for a blackened shilling I found in my pocket. Most of"
"9317",36,"it was in blank, but the solitary compositor who did the thing had"
"9318",36,"amused himself by making a grotesque scheme of advertisement stereo on"
"9319",36,"the back page. The matter he printed was emotional; the news"
"9320",36,"organisation had not as yet found its way back. I learned nothing fresh"
"9321",36,"except that already in one week the examination of the Martian"
"9322",36,"mechanisms had yielded astonishing results. Among other things, the"
"9323",36,"article assured me what I did not believe at the time, that the “Secret"
"9324",36,"of Flying,” was discovered. At Waterloo I found the free trains that"
"9325",36,"were taking people to their homes. The first rush was already over."
"9326",36,"There were few people in the train, and I was in no mood for casual"
"9327",36,"conversation. I got a compartment to myself, and sat with folded arms,"
"9328",36,"looking greyly at the sunlit devastation that flowed past the windows."
"9329",36,"And just outside the terminus the train jolted over temporary rails,"
"9330",36,"and on either side of the railway the houses were blackened ruins. To"
"9331",36,"Clapham Junction the face of London was grimy with powder of the Black"
"9332",36,"Smoke, in spite of two days of thunderstorms and rain, and at Clapham"
"9333",36,"Junction the line had been wrecked again; there were hundreds of"
"9334",36,"out-of-work clerks and shopmen working side by side with the customary"
"9335",36,"navvies, and we were jolted over a hasty relaying."
"9336",36,""
"9337",36,"All down the line from there the aspect of the country was gaunt and"
"9338",36,"unfamiliar; Wimbledon particularly had suffered. Walton, by virtue of"
"9339",36,"its unburned pine woods, seemed the least hurt of any place along the"
"9340",36,"line. The Wandle, the Mole, every little stream, was a heaped mass of"
"9341",36,"red weed, in appearance between butcher’s meat and pickled cabbage. The"
"9342",36,"Surrey pine woods were too dry, however, for the festoons of the red"
"9343",36,"climber. Beyond Wimbledon, within sight of the line, in certain nursery"
"9344",36,"grounds, were the heaped masses of earth about the sixth cylinder. A"
"9345",36,"number of people were standing about it, and some sappers were busy in"
"9346",36,"the midst of it. Over it flaunted a Union Jack, flapping cheerfully in"
"9347",36,"the morning breeze. The nursery grounds were everywhere crimson with"
"9348",36,"the weed, a wide expanse of livid colour cut with purple shadows, and"
"9349",36,"very painful to the eye. One’s gaze went with infinite relief from the"
"9350",36,"scorched greys and sullen reds of the foreground to the blue-green"
"9351",36,"softness of the eastward hills."
"9352",36,""
"9353",36,"The line on the London side of Woking station was still undergoing"
"9354",36,"repair, so I descended at Byfleet station and took the road to Maybury,"
"9355",36,"past the place where I and the artilleryman had talked to the hussars,"
"9356",36,"and on by the spot where the Martian had appeared to me in the"
"9357",36,"thunderstorm. Here, moved by curiosity, I turned aside to find, among a"
"9358",36,"tangle of red fronds, the warped and broken dog cart with the whitened"
"9359",36,"bones of the horse scattered and gnawed. For a time I stood regarding"
"9360",36,"these vestiges. . . ."
"9361",36,""
"9362",36,"Then I returned through the pine wood, neck-high with red weed here and"
"9363",36,"there, to find the landlord of the Spotted Dog had already found"
"9364",36,"burial, and so came home past the College Arms. A man standing at an"
"9365",36,"open cottage door greeted me by name as I passed."
"9366",36,""
"9367",36,"I looked at my house with a quick flash of hope that faded immediately."
"9368",36,"The door had been forced; it was unfast and was opening slowly as I"
"9369",36,"approached."
"9370",36,""
"9371",36,"It slammed again. The curtains of my study fluttered out of the open"
"9372",36,"window from which I and the artilleryman had watched the dawn. No one"
"9373",36,"had closed it since. The smashed bushes were just as I had left them"
"9374",36,"nearly four weeks ago. I stumbled into the hall, and the house felt"
"9375",36,"empty. The stair carpet was ruffled and discoloured where I had"
"9376",36,"crouched, soaked to the skin from the thunderstorm the night of the"
"9377",36,"catastrophe. Our muddy footsteps I saw still went up the stairs."
"9378",36,""
"9379",36,"I followed them to my study, and found lying on my writing-table still,"
"9380",36,"with the selenite paper weight upon it, the sheet of work I had left on"
"9381",36,"the afternoon of the opening of the cylinder. For a space I stood"
"9382",36,"reading over my abandoned arguments. It was a paper on the probable"
"9383",36,"development of Moral Ideas with the development of the civilising"
"9384",36,"process; and the last sentence was the opening of a prophecy: “In about"
"9385",36,"two hundred years,” I had written, “we may expect——” The sentence ended"
"9386",36,"abruptly. I remembered my inability to fix my mind that morning,"
"9387",36,"scarcely a month gone by, and how I had broken off to get my _Daily"
"9388",36,"Chronicle_ from the newsboy. I remembered how I went down to the garden"
"9389",36,"gate as he came along, and how I had listened to his odd story of “Men"
"9390",36,"from Mars.”"
"9391",36,""
"9392",36,"I came down and went into the dining room. There were the mutton and"
"9393",36,"the bread, both far gone now in decay, and a beer bottle overturned,"
"9394",36,"just as I and the artilleryman had left them. My home was desolate. I"
"9395",36,"perceived the folly of the faint hope I had cherished so long. And then"
"9396",36,"a strange thing occurred. “It is no use,” said a voice. “The house is"
"9397",36,"deserted. No one has been here these ten days. Do not stay here to"
"9398",36,"torment yourself. No one escaped but you.”"
"9399",36,""
"9400",36,"I was startled. Had I spoken my thought aloud? I turned, and the French"
"9401",36,"window was open behind me. I made a step to it, and stood looking out."
"9402",36,""
"9403",36,"And there, amazed and afraid, even as I stood amazed and afraid, were"
"9404",36,"my cousin and my wife—my wife white and tearless. She gave a faint cry."

"9406",36,"“I came,” she said. “I knew—knew——”"

"9421",36,"criticism. My particular province is speculative philosophy. My"

"9423",36,"it seems to me that Carver’s suggestions as to the reason of the rapid"

"9434",36,"Neither is the composition of the Black Smoke known, which the Martians"

"9437",36,"Kensington laboratories have disinclined analysts for further"
"9438",36,"investigations upon the latter. Spectrum analysis of the black powder"
"9439",36,"points unmistakably to the presence of an unknown element with a"
"9440",36,"brilliant group of three lines in the green, and it is possible that it"

"9448",36,"The results of an anatomical examination of the Martians, so far as the"

"9459",36,"for one, anticipate a renewal of their adventure. In any case, we"
"9460",36,"should be prepared. It seems to me that it should be possible to define"
"9461",36,"the position of the gun from which the shots are discharged, to keep a"

"9466",36,"before it was sufficiently cool for the Martians to emerge, or they"
"9467",36,"might be butchered by means of guns so soon as the screw opened. It"
"9468",36,"seems to me that they have lost a vast advantage in the failure of"
"9469",36,"their first surprise. Possibly they see it in the same light."

"9471",36,"Lessing has advanced excellent reasons for supposing that the Martians"
"9472",36,"have actually succeeded in effecting a landing on the planet Venus."

"9474",36,"that is to say, Mars was in opposition from the point of view of an"
"9475",36,"observer on Venus. Subsequently a peculiar luminous and sinuous marking"
"9476",36,"appeared on the unillumined half of the inner planet, and almost"
"9477",36,"simultaneously a faint dark mark of a similar sinuous character was"

"9482",36,"At any rate, whether we expect another invasion or not, our views of"
"9483",36,"the human future must be greatly modified by these events. We have"
"9484",36,"learned now that we cannot regard this planet as being fenced in and a"
"9485",36,"secure abiding place for Man; we can never anticipate the unseen good"
"9486",36,"or evil that may come upon us suddenly out of space. It may be that in"

"9488",36,"without its ultimate benefit for men; it has robbed us of that serene"
"9489",36,"confidence in the future which is the most fruitful source of"
"9490",36,"decadence, the gifts to human science it has brought are enormous, and"
"9491",36,"it has done much to promote the conception of the commonweal of"
"9492",36,"mankind. It may be that across the immensity of space the Martians have"
"9493",36,"watched the fate of these pioneers of theirs and learned their lesson,"
"9494",36,"and that on the planet Venus they have found a securer settlement. Be"
"9495",36,"that as it may, for many years yet there will certainly be no"
"9496",36,"relaxation of the eager scrutiny of the Martian disk, and those fiery"

"9500",36,"The broadening of men’s views that has resulted can scarcely be"

"9503",36,"surface of our minute sphere. Now we see further. If the Martians can"
"9504",36,"reach Venus, there is no reason to suppose that the thing is impossible"
"9505",36,"for men, and when the slow cooling of the sun makes this earth"
"9506",36,"uninhabitable, as at last it must do, it may be that the thread of life"

"9513",36,"remote dream. It may be, on the other hand, that the destruction of the"

"9588",159,""
"9589",159,"On February the First 1887, the _Lady Vain_ was lost by collision with"
"9590",159,"a derelict when about the latitude 1° S. and longitude 107° W."
"9591",159,""
"9592",159,"On January the Fifth, 1888—that is eleven months and four days after—my"
"9593",159,"uncle, Edward Prendick, a private gentleman, who certainly went aboard"
"9594",159,"the _Lady Vain_ at Callao, and who had been considered drowned, was"
"9595",159,"picked up in latitude 5° 3′ S. and longitude 101° W. in a small open"
"9596",159,"boat of which the name was illegible, but which is supposed to have"
"9597",159,"belonged to the missing schooner _Ipecacuanha_. He gave such a strange"
"9598",159,"account of himself that he was supposed demented. Subsequently he"
"9599",159,"alleged that his mind was a blank from the moment of his escape from"
"9600",159,"the _Lady Vain_. His case was discussed among psychologists at the time"
"9601",159,"as a curious instance of the lapse of memory consequent upon physical"
"9602",159,"and mental stress. The following narrative was found among his papers"
"9603",159,"by the undersigned, his nephew and heir, but unaccompanied by any"
"9604",159,"definite request for publication."
"9605",159,""
"9606",159,"The only island known to exist in the region in which my uncle was"
"9607",159,"picked up is Noble’s Isle, a small volcanic islet and uninhabited. It"
"9608",159,"was visited in 1891 by _H. M. S. Scorpion_. A party of sailors then"
"9609",159,"landed, but found nothing living thereon except certain curious white"
"9610",159,"moths, some hogs and rabbits, and some rather peculiar rats. So that"
"9611",159,"this narrative is without confirmation in its most essential"
"9612",159,"particular. With that understood, there seems no harm in putting this"
"9613",159,"strange story before the public in accordance, as I believe, with my"
"9614",159,"uncle’s intentions. There is at least this much in its behalf: my uncle"
"9615",159,"passed out of human knowledge about latitude 5° S. and longitude 105°"
"9616",159,"E., and reappeared in the same part of the ocean after a space of"
"9617",159,"eleven months. In some way he must have lived during the interval. And"
"9618",159,"it seems that a schooner called the _Ipecacuanha_ with a drunken"
"9619",159,"captain, John Davies, did start from Africa with a puma and certain"
"9620",159,"other animals aboard in January, 1887, that the vessel was well known"
"9621",159,"at several ports in the South Pacific, and that it finally disappeared"
"9622",159,"from those seas (with a considerable amount of copra aboard), sailing"
"9623",159,"to its unknown fate from Bayna in December, 1887, a date that tallies"
"9624",159,"entirely with my uncle’s story."

"9648",159,"to the published story of the _Lady Vain_ another, possibly as horrible"
"9649",159,"and far stranger. It has hitherto been supposed that the four men who"
"9650",159,"were in the dingey perished, but this is incorrect. I have the best of"
"9651",159,"evidence for this assertion: I was one of the four men."
"9652",159,""
"9653",159,"But in the first place I must state that there never were _four_ men in"

"9665",159,"I say luckily for us he did not reach us, and I might almost say"
"9666",159,"luckily for himself; for we had only a small beaker of water and some"
"9667",159,"soddened ship’s biscuits with us, so sudden had been the alarm, so"
"9668",159,"unprepared the ship for any disaster. We thought the people on the"
"9669",159,"launch would be better provisioned (though it seems they were not), and"
"9670",159,"we tried to hail them. They could not have heard us, and the next"
"9671",159,"morning when the drizzle cleared,—which was not until past midday,—we"
"9672",159,"could see nothing of them. We could not stand up to look about us,"
"9673",159,"because of the pitching of the boat. The two other men who had escaped"
"9674",159,"so far with me were a man named Helmar, a passenger like myself, and a"
"9675",159,"seaman whose name I don’t know,—a short sturdy man, with a stammer."
"9676",159,""
"9677",159,"We drifted famishing, and, after our water had come to an end,"
"9678",159,"tormented by an intolerable thirst, for eight days altogether. After"
"9679",159,"the second day the sea subsided slowly to a glassy calm. It is quite"
"9680",159,"impossible for the ordinary reader to imagine those eight days. He has"
"9681",159,"not, luckily for himself, anything in his memory to imagine with. After"
"9682",159,"the first day we said little to one another, and lay in our places in"
"9683",159,"the boat and stared at the horizon, or watched, with eyes that grew"
"9684",159,"larger and more haggard every day, the misery and weakness gaining upon"
"9685",159,"our companions. The sun became pitiless. The water ended on the fourth"
"9686",159,"day, and we were already thinking strange things and saying them with"
"9687",159,"our eyes; but it was, I think, the sixth before Helmar gave voice to"
"9688",159,"the thing we had all been thinking. I remember our voices were dry and"
"9689",159,"thin, so that we bent towards one another and spared our words. I stood"
"9690",159,"out against it with all my might, was rather for scuttling the boat and"
"9691",159,"perishing together among the sharks that followed us; but when Helmar"
"9692",159,"said that if his proposal was accepted we should have drink, the sailor"
"9693",159,"came round to him."
"9694",159,""
"9695",159,"I would not draw lots however, and in the night the sailor whispered to"
"9696",159,"Helmar again and again, and I sat in the bows with my clasp-knife in my"
"9697",159,"hand, though I doubt if I had the stuff in me to fight; and in the"
"9698",159,"morning I agreed to Helmar’s proposal, and we handed halfpence to find"
"9699",159,"the odd man. The lot fell upon the sailor; but he was the strongest of"
"9700",159,"us and would not abide by it, and attacked Helmar with his hands. They"
"9701",159,"grappled together and almost stood up. I crawled along the boat to"
"9702",159,"them, intending to help Helmar by grasping the sailor’s leg; but the"
"9703",159,"sailor stumbled with the swaying of the boat, and the two fell upon the"
"9704",159,"gunwale and rolled overboard together. They sank like stones. I"
"9705",159,"remember laughing at that, and wondering why I laughed. The laugh"
"9706",159,"caught me suddenly like a thing from without."
"9707",159,""
"9708",159,"I lay across one of the thwarts for I know not how long, thinking that"
"9709",159,"if I had the strength I would drink sea-water and madden myself to die"
"9710",159,"quickly. And even as I lay there I saw, with no more interest than if"
"9711",159,"it had been a picture, a sail come up towards me over the sky-line. My"
"9712",159,"mind must have been wandering, and yet I remember all that happened,"
"9713",159,"quite distinctly. I remember how my head swayed with the seas, and the"
"9714",159,"horizon with the sail above it danced up and down; but I also remember"
"9715",159,"as distinctly that I had a persuasion that I was dead, and that I"
"9716",159,"thought what a jest it was that they should come too late by such a"
"9717",159,"little to catch me in my body."
"9718",159,""
"9719",159,"For an endless period, as it seemed to me, I lay with my head on the"
"9720",159,"thwart watching the schooner (she was a little ship, schooner-rigged"
"9721",159,"fore and aft) come up out of the sea. She kept tacking to and fro in a"
"9722",159,"widening compass, for she was sailing dead into the wind. It never"
"9723",159,"entered my head to attempt to attract attention, and I do not remember"
"9724",159,"anything distinctly after the sight of her side until I found myself in"
"9725",159,"a little cabin aft. There’s a dim half-memory of being lifted up to the"
"9726",159,"gangway, and of a big round countenance covered with freckles and"
"9727",159,"surrounded with red hair staring at me over the bulwarks. I also had a"
"9728",159,"disconnected impression of a dark face, with extraordinary eyes, close"
"9729",159,"to mine; but that I thought was a nightmare, until I met it again. I"
"9730",159,"fancy I recollect some stuff being poured in between my teeth; and that"

"9739",159,""
"9740",159,"The cabin in which I found myself was small and rather untidy. A"
"9741",159,"youngish man with flaxen hair, a bristly straw-coloured moustache, and"
"9742",159,"a dropping nether lip, was sitting and holding my wrist. For a minute"
"9743",159,"we stared at each other without speaking. He had watery grey eyes,"
"9744",159,"oddly void of expression. Then just overhead came a sound like an iron"
"9745",159,"bedstead being knocked about, and the low angry growling of some large"
"9746",159,"animal. At the same time the man spoke. He repeated his question,—“How"
"9747",159,"do you feel now?”"
"9748",159,""
"9749",159,"I think I said I felt all right. I could not recollect how I had got"
"9750",159,"there. He must have seen the question in my face, for my voice was"
"9751",159,"inaccessible to me."
"9752",159,""
"9753",159,"“You were picked up in a boat, starving. The name on the boat was the"
"9754",159,"_Lady Vain_, and there were spots of blood on the gunwale.”"
"9755",159,""
"9756",159,"At the same time my eye caught my hand, so thin that it looked like a"
"9757",159,"dirty skin-purse full of loose bones, and all the business of the boat"
"9758",159,"came back to me."
"9759",159,""
"9760",159,"“Have some of this,” said he, and gave me a dose of some scarlet stuff,"
"9761",159,"iced."
"9762",159,""
"9763",159,"It tasted like blood, and made me feel stronger."
"9764",159,""
"9765",159,"“You were in luck,” said he, “to get picked up by a ship with a medical"
"9766",159,"man aboard.” He spoke with a slobbering articulation, with the ghost of"
"9767",159,"a lisp."
"9768",159,""
"9769",159,"“What ship is this?” I said slowly, hoarse from my long silence."
"9770",159,""
"9771",159,"“It’s a little trader from Arica and Callao. I never asked where she"
"9772",159,"came from in the beginning,—out of the land of born fools, I guess. I’m"
"9773",159,"a passenger myself, from Arica. The silly ass who owns her,—he’s"
"9774",159,"captain too, named Davies,—he’s lost his certificate, or something. You"
"9775",159,"know the kind of man,—calls the thing the _Ipecacuanha_, of all silly,"
"9776",159,"infernal names; though when there’s much of a sea without any wind, she"
"9777",159,"certainly acts according.”"
"9778",159,""
"9779",159,"(Then the noise overhead began again, a snarling growl and the voice of"
"9780",159,"a human being together. Then another voice, telling some"
"9781",159,"“Heaven-forsaken idiot” to desist.)"
"9782",159,""
"9783",159,"“You were nearly dead,” said my interlocutor. “It was a very near"
"9784",159,"thing, indeed. But I’ve put some stuff into you now. Notice your arm’s"
"9785",159,"sore? Injections. You’ve been insensible for nearly thirty hours.”"
"9786",159,""
"9787",159,"I thought slowly. (I was distracted now by the yelping of a number of"
"9788",159,"dogs.) “Am I eligible for solid food?” I asked."
"9789",159,""
"9790",159,"“Thanks to me,” he said. “Even now the mutton is boiling.”"
"9791",159,""
"9792",159,"“Yes,” I said with assurance; “I could eat some mutton.”"
"9793",159,""
"9794",159,"“But,” said he with a momentary hesitation, “you know I’m dying to hear"
"9795",159,"of how you came to be alone in that boat. _Damn that howling_!” I"
"9796",159,"thought I detected a certain suspicion in his eyes."
"9797",159,""
"9798",159,"He suddenly left the cabin, and I heard him in violent controversy with"
"9799",159,"some one, who seemed to me to talk gibberish in response to him. The"
"9800",159,"matter sounded as though it ended in blows, but in that I thought my"
"9801",159,"ears were mistaken. Then he shouted at the dogs, and returned to the"
"9802",159,"cabin."
"9803",159,""
"9804",159,"“Well?” said he in the doorway. “You were just beginning to tell me.”"
"9805",159,""
"9806",159,"I told him my name, Edward Prendick, and how I had taken to Natural"
"9807",159,"History as a relief from the dulness of my comfortable independence."
"9808",159,""
"9809",159,"He seemed interested in this. “I’ve done some science myself. I did my"
"9810",159,"Biology at University College,—getting out the ovary of the earthworm"
"9811",159,"and the radula of the snail, and all that. Lord! It’s ten years ago."
"9812",159,"But go on! go on! tell me about the boat.”"
"9813",159,""
"9814",159,"He was evidently satisfied with the frankness of my story, which I told"
"9815",159,"in concise sentences enough, for I felt horribly weak; and when it was"
"9816",159,"finished he reverted at once to the topic of Natural History and his"
"9817",159,"own biological studies. He began to question me closely about Tottenham"
"9818",159,"Court Road and Gower Street. “Is Caplatzi still flourishing? What a"
"9819",159,"shop that was!” He had evidently been a very ordinary medical student,"
"9820",159,"and drifted incontinently to the topic of the music halls. He told me"
"9821",159,"some anecdotes."
"9822",159,""
"9823",159,"“Left it all,” he said, “ten years ago. How jolly it all used to be!"
"9824",159,"But I made a young ass of myself,—played myself out before I was"
"9825",159,"twenty-one. I daresay it’s all different now. But I must look up that"
"9826",159,"ass of a cook, and see what he’s done to your mutton.”"
"9827",159,""
"9828",159,"The growling overhead was renewed, so suddenly and with so much savage"
"9829",159,"anger that it startled me. “What’s that?” I called after him, but the"
"9830",159,"door had closed. He came back again with the boiled mutton, and I was"
"9831",159,"so excited by the appetising smell of it that I forgot the noise of the"
"9832",159,"beast that had troubled me."
"9833",159,""
"9834",159,"After a day of alternate sleep and feeding I was so far recovered as to"
"9835",159,"be able to get from my bunk to the scuttle, and see the green seas"
"9836",159,"trying to keep pace with us. I judged the schooner was running before"
"9837",159,"the wind. Montgomery—that was the name of the flaxen-haired man—came in"
"9838",159,"again as I stood there, and I asked him for some clothes. He lent me"
"9839",159,"some duck things of his own, for those I had worn in the boat had been"
"9840",159,"thrown overboard. They were rather loose for me, for he was large and"
"9841",159,"long in his limbs. He told me casually that the captain was three-parts"
"9842",159,"drunk in his own cabin. As I assumed the clothes, I began asking him"
"9843",159,"some questions about the destination of the ship. He said the ship was"
"9844",159,"bound to Hawaii, but that it had to land him first."
"9845",159,""
"9846",159,"“Where?” said I."
"9847",159,""
"9848",159,"“It’s an island, where I live. So far as I know, it hasn’t got a name.”"
"9849",159,""
"9850",159,"He stared at me with his nether lip dropping, and looked so wilfully"
"9851",159,"stupid of a sudden that it came into my head that he desired to avoid"
"9852",159,"my questions. I had the discretion to ask no more."

"9860",159,""
"9861",159,"We left the cabin and found a man at the companion obstructing our way."
"9862",159,"He was standing on the ladder with his back to us, peering over the"
"9863",159,"combing of the hatchway. He was, I could see, a misshapen man, short,"
"9864",159,"broad, and clumsy, with a crooked back, a hairy neck, and a head sunk"
"9865",159,"between his shoulders. He was dressed in dark-blue serge, and had"
"9866",159,"peculiarly thick, coarse, black hair. I heard the unseen dogs growl"
"9867",159,"furiously, and forthwith he ducked back,—coming into contact with the"
"9868",159,"hand I put out to fend him off from myself. He turned with animal"
"9869",159,"swiftness."
"9870",159,""
"9871",159,"In some indefinable way the black face thus flashed upon me shocked me"
"9872",159,"profoundly. It was a singularly deformed one. The facial part"
"9873",159,"projected, forming something dimly suggestive of a muzzle, and the huge"
"9874",159,"half-open mouth showed as big white teeth as I had ever seen in a human"
"9875",159,"mouth. His eyes were blood-shot at the edges, with scarcely a rim of"
"9876",159,"white round the hazel pupils. There was a curious glow of excitement in"
"9877",159,"his face."
"9878",159,""
"9879",159,"“Confound you!” said Montgomery. “Why the devil don’t you get out of"
"9880",159,"the way?”"
"9881",159,""
"9882",159,"The black-faced man started aside without a word. I went on up the"
"9883",159,"companion, staring at him instinctively as I did so. Montgomery stayed"
"9884",159,"at the foot for a moment. “You have no business here, you know,” he"
"9885",159,"said in a deliberate tone. “Your place is forward.”"
"9886",159,""
"9887",159,"The black-faced man cowered. “They—won’t have me forward.” He spoke"
"9888",159,"slowly, with a queer, hoarse quality in his voice."
"9889",159,""
"9890",159,"“Won’t have you forward!” said Montgomery, in a menacing voice. “But I"
"9891",159,"tell you to go!” He was on the brink of saying something further, then"
"9892",159,"looked up at me suddenly and followed me up the ladder."
"9893",159,""
"9894",159,"I had paused half way through the hatchway, looking back, still"
"9895",159,"astonished beyond measure at the grotesque ugliness of this black-faced"
"9896",159,"creature. I had never beheld such a repulsive and extraordinary face"
"9897",159,"before, and yet—if the contradiction is credible—I experienced at the"
"9898",159,"same time an odd feeling that in some way I _had_ already encountered"
"9899",159,"exactly the features and gestures that now amazed me. Afterwards it"
"9900",159,"occurred to me that probably I had seen him as I was lifted aboard; and"
"9901",159,"yet that scarcely satisfied my suspicion of a previous acquaintance."
"9902",159,"Yet how one could have set eyes on so singular a face and yet have"
"9903",159,"forgotten the precise occasion, passed my imagination."
"9904",159,""
"9905",159,"Montgomery’s movement to follow me released my attention, and I turned"
"9906",159,"and looked about me at the flush deck of the little schooner. I was"
"9907",159,"already half prepared by the sounds I had heard for what I saw."
"9908",159,"Certainly I never beheld a deck so dirty. It was littered with scraps"
"9909",159,"of carrot, shreds of green stuff, and indescribable filth. Fastened by"
"9910",159,"chains to the mainmast were a number of grisly staghounds, who now"
"9911",159,"began leaping and barking at me, and by the mizzen a huge puma was"
"9912",159,"cramped in a little iron cage far too small even to give it turning"
"9913",159,"room. Farther under the starboard bulwark were some big hutches"
"9914",159,"containing a number of rabbits, and a solitary llama was squeezed in a"
"9915",159,"mere box of a cage forward. The dogs were muzzled by leather straps."
"9916",159,"The only human being on deck was a gaunt and silent sailor at the"
"9917",159,"wheel."
"9918",159,""
"9919",159,"The patched and dirty spankers were tense before the wind, and up aloft"
"9920",159,"the little ship seemed carrying every sail she had. The sky was clear,"
"9921",159,"the sun midway down the western sky; long waves, capped by the breeze"
"9922",159,"with froth, were running with us. We went past the steersman to the"
"9923",159,"taffrail, and saw the water come foaming under the stern and the"
"9924",159,"bubbles go dancing and vanishing in her wake. I turned and surveyed the"
"9925",159,"unsavoury length of the ship."
"9926",159,""
"9927",159,"“Is this an ocean menagerie?” said I."
"9928",159,""
"9929",159,"“Looks like it,” said Montgomery."
"9930",159,""
"9931",159,"“What are these beasts for? Merchandise, curios? Does the captain think"
"9932",159,"he is going to sell them somewhere in the South Seas?”"
"9933",159,""
"9934",159,"“It looks like it, doesn’t it?” said Montgomery, and turned towards the"
"9935",159,"wake again."
"9936",159,""
"9937",159,"Suddenly we heard a yelp and a volley of furious blasphemy from the"
"9938",159,"companion hatchway, and the deformed man with the black face came up"
"9939",159,"hurriedly. He was immediately followed by a heavy red-haired man in a"
"9940",159,"white cap. At the sight of the former the staghounds, who had all tired"
"9941",159,"of barking at me by this time, became furiously excited, howling and"
"9942",159,"leaping against their chains. The black hesitated before them, and this"
"9943",159,"gave the red-haired man time to come up with him and deliver a"
"9944",159,"tremendous blow between the shoulder-blades. The poor devil went down"
"9945",159,"like a felled ox, and rolled in the dirt among the furiously excited"
"9946",159,"dogs. It was lucky for him that they were muzzled. The red-haired man"
"9947",159,"gave a yawp of exultation and stood staggering, and as it seemed to me"
"9948",159,"in serious danger of either going backwards down the companion hatchway"
"9949",159,"or forwards upon his victim."
"9950",159,""
"9951",159,"So soon as the second man had appeared, Montgomery had started forward."
"9952",159,"“Steady on there!” he cried, in a tone of remonstrance. A couple of"
"9953",159,"sailors appeared on the forecastle. The black-faced man, howling in a"
"9954",159,"singular voice rolled about under the feet of the dogs. No one"
"9955",159,"attempted to help him. The brutes did their best to worry him, butting"
"9956",159,"their muzzles at him. There was a quick dance of their lithe"
"9957",159,"grey-figured bodies over the clumsy, prostrate figure. The sailors"
"9958",159,"forward shouted, as though it was admirable sport. Montgomery gave an"
"9959",159,"angry exclamation, and went striding down the deck, and I followed him."
"9960",159,"The black-faced man scrambled up and staggered forward, going and"
"9961",159,"leaning over the bulwark by the main shrouds, where he remained,"
"9962",159,"panting and glaring over his shoulder at the dogs. The red-haired man"
"9963",159,"laughed a satisfied laugh."
"9964",159,""
"9965",159,"“Look here, Captain,” said Montgomery, with his lisp a little"
"9966",159,"accentuated, gripping the elbows of the red-haired man, “this won’t"
"9967",159,"do!”"
"9968",159,""
"9969",159,"I stood behind Montgomery. The captain came half round, and regarded"
"9970",159,"him with the dull and solemn eyes of a drunken man. “Wha’ won’t do?” he"
"9971",159,"said, and added, after looking sleepily into Montgomery’s face for a"
"9972",159,"minute, “Blasted Sawbones!”"
"9973",159,""
"9974",159,"With a sudden movement he shook his arms free, and after two"
"9975",159,"ineffectual attempts stuck his freckled fists into his side pockets."
"9976",159,""
"9977",159,"“That man’s a passenger,” said Montgomery. “I’d advise you to keep your"
"9978",159,"hands off him.”"
"9979",159,""
"9980",159,"“Go to hell!” said the captain, loudly. He suddenly turned and"
"9981",159,"staggered towards the side. “Do what I like on my own ship,” he said."
"9982",159,""
"9983",159,"I think Montgomery might have left him then, seeing the brute was"
"9984",159,"drunk; but he only turned a shade paler, and followed the captain to"
"9985",159,"the bulwarks."
"9986",159,""
"9987",159,"“Look you here, Captain,” he said; “that man of mine is not to be"
"9988",159,"ill-treated. He has been hazed ever since he came aboard.”"
"9989",159,""
"9990",159,"For a minute, alcoholic fumes kept the captain speechless. “Blasted"
"9991",159,"Sawbones!” was all he considered necessary."
"9992",159,""
"9993",159,"I could see that Montgomery had one of those slow, pertinacious tempers"
"9994",159,"that will warm day after day to a white heat, and never again cool to"
"9995",159,"forgiveness; and I saw too that this quarrel had been some time"
"9996",159,"growing. “The man’s drunk,” said I, perhaps officiously; “you’ll do no"
"9997",159,"good.”"
"9998",159,""
"9999",159,"Montgomery gave an ugly twist to his dropping lip. “He’s always drunk."
"10000",159,"Do you think that excuses his assaulting his passengers?”"
"10001",159,""
"10002",159,"“My ship,” began the captain, waving his hand unsteadily towards the"
"10003",159,"cages, “was a clean ship. Look at it now!” It was certainly anything"
"10004",159,"but clean. “Crew,” continued the captain, “clean, respectable crew.”"
"10005",159,""
"10006",159,"“You agreed to take the beasts.”"
"10007",159,""
"10008",159,"“I wish I’d never set eyes on your infernal island. What the devil—want"
"10009",159,"beasts for on an island like that? Then, that man of yours—understood"
"10010",159,"he was a man. He’s a lunatic; and he hadn’t no business aft. Do you"
"10011",159,"think the whole damned ship belongs to you?”"
"10012",159,""
"10013",159,"“Your sailors began to haze the poor devil as soon as he came aboard.”"
"10014",159,""
"10015",159,"“That’s just what he is—he’s a devil! an ugly devil! My men can’t stand"
"10016",159,"him. _I_ can’t stand him. None of us can’t stand him. Nor _you_"
"10017",159,"either!”"
"10018",159,""
"10019",159,"Montgomery turned away. “_You_ leave that man alone, anyhow,” he said,"
"10020",159,"nodding his head as he spoke."
"10021",159,""
"10022",159,"But the captain meant to quarrel now. He raised his voice. “If he comes"
"10023",159,"this end of the ship again I’ll cut his insides out, I tell you. Cut"
"10024",159,"out his blasted insides! Who are _you_, to tell _me_ what _I’m_ to do?"
"10025",159,"I tell you I’m captain of this ship,—captain and owner. I’m the law"
"10026",159,"here, I tell you,—the law and the prophets. I bargained to take a man"
"10027",159,"and his attendant to and from Arica, and bring back some animals. I"
"10028",159,"never bargained to carry a mad devil and a silly Sawbones, a—”"
"10029",159,""
"10030",159,"Well, never mind what he called Montgomery. I saw the latter take a"
"10031",159,"step forward, and interposed. “He’s drunk,” said I. The captain began"
"10032",159,"some abuse even fouler than the last. “Shut up!” I said, turning on him"
"10033",159,"sharply, for I had seen danger in Montgomery’s white face. With that I"
"10034",159,"brought the downpour on myself."
"10035",159,""
"10036",159,"However, I was glad to avert what was uncommonly near a scuffle, even"
"10037",159,"at the price of the captain’s drunken ill-will. I do not think I have"
"10038",159,"ever heard quite so much vile language come in a continuous stream from"
"10039",159,"any man’s lips before, though I have frequented eccentric company"
"10040",159,"enough. I found some of it hard to endure, though I am a mild-tempered"
"10041",159,"man; but, certainly, when I told the captain to “shut up” I had"
"10042",159,"forgotten that I was merely a bit of human flotsam, cut off from my"
"10043",159,"resources and with my fare unpaid; a mere casual dependant on the"
"10044",159,"bounty, or speculative enterprise, of the ship. He reminded me of it"
"10045",159,"with considerable vigour; but at any rate I prevented a fight."

"10053",159,""
"10054",159,"That night land was sighted after sundown, and the schooner hove to."
"10055",159,"Montgomery intimated that was his destination. It was too far to see"
"10056",159,"any details; it seemed to me then simply a low-lying patch of dim blue"
"10057",159,"in the uncertain blue-grey sea. An almost vertical streak of smoke went"
"10058",159,"up from it into the sky. The captain was not on deck when it was"
"10059",159,"sighted. After he had vented his wrath on me he had staggered below,"
"10060",159,"and I understand he went to sleep on the floor of his own cabin. The"
"10061",159,"mate practically assumed the command. He was the gaunt, taciturn"
"10062",159,"individual we had seen at the wheel. Apparently he was in an evil"
"10063",159,"temper with Montgomery. He took not the slightest notice of either of"
"10064",159,"us. We dined with him in a sulky silence, after a few ineffectual"
"10065",159,"efforts on my part to talk. It struck me too that the men regarded my"
"10066",159,"companion and his animals in a singularly unfriendly manner. I found"
"10067",159,"Montgomery very reticent about his purpose with these creatures, and"
"10068",159,"about his destination; and though I was sensible of a growing curiosity"
"10069",159,"as to both, I did not press him."
"10070",159,""
"10071",159,"We remained talking on the quarter deck until the sky was thick with"
"10072",159,"stars. Except for an occasional sound in the yellow-lit forecastle and"
"10073",159,"a movement of the animals now and then, the night was very still. The"
"10074",159,"puma lay crouched together, watching us with shining eyes, a black heap"
"10075",159,"in the corner of its cage. Montgomery produced some cigars. He talked"
"10076",159,"to me of London in a tone of half-painful reminiscence, asking all"
"10077",159,"kinds of questions about changes that had taken place. He spoke like a"
"10078",159,"man who had loved his life there, and had been suddenly and irrevocably"
"10079",159,"cut off from it. I gossiped as well as I could of this and that. All"
"10080",159,"the time the strangeness of him was shaping itself in my mind; and as I"
"10081",159,"talked I peered at his odd, pallid face in the dim light of the"
"10082",159,"binnacle lantern behind me. Then I looked out at the darkling sea,"
"10083",159,"where in the dimness his little island was hidden."
"10084",159,""
"10085",159,"This man, it seemed to me, had come out of Immensity merely to save my"
"10086",159,"life. To-morrow he would drop over the side, and vanish again out of my"
"10087",159,"existence. Even had it been under commonplace circumstances, it would"
"10088",159,"have made me a trifle thoughtful; but in the first place was the"
"10089",159,"singularity of an educated man living on this unknown little island,"
"10090",159,"and coupled with that the extraordinary nature of his luggage. I found"
"10091",159,"myself repeating the captain’s question. What did he want with the"
"10092",159,"beasts? Why, too, had he pretended they were not his when I had"
"10093",159,"remarked about them at first? Then, again, in his personal attendant"
"10094",159,"there was a bizarre quality which had impressed me profoundly. These"
"10095",159,"circumstances threw a haze of mystery round the man. They laid hold of"
"10096",159,"my imagination, and hampered my tongue."
"10097",159,""
"10098",159,"Towards midnight our talk of London died away, and we stood side by"
"10099",159,"side leaning over the bulwarks and staring dreamily over the silent,"
"10100",159,"starlit sea, each pursuing his own thoughts. It was the atmosphere for"
"10101",159,"sentiment, and I began upon my gratitude."
"10102",159,""
"10103",159,"“If I may say it,” said I, after a time, “you have saved my life.”"

"10109",159,"“Thank no one. You had the need, and I had the knowledge; and I"
"10110",159,"injected and fed you much as I might have collected a specimen. I was"
"10111",159,"bored and wanted something to do. If I’d been jaded that day, or hadn’t"
"10112",159,"liked your face, well—it’s a curious question where you would have been"
"10113",159,"now!”"
"10114",159,""
"10115",159,"This damped my mood a little. “At any rate,” I began."
"10116",159,""
"10117",159,"“It’s a chance, I tell you,” he interrupted, “as everything is in a"
"10118",159,"man’s life. Only the asses won’t see it! Why am I here now, an outcast"
"10119",159,"from civilisation, instead of being a happy man enjoying all the"
"10120",159,"pleasures of London? Simply because eleven years ago—I lost my head for"
"10121",159,"ten minutes on a foggy night.”"

"10125",159,"“That’s all.”"

"10127",159,"We relapsed into silence. Presently he laughed. “There’s something in"
"10128",159,"this starlight that loosens one’s tongue. I’m an ass, and yet somehow I"
"10129",159,"would like to tell you.”"
"10130",159,""
"10131",159,"“Whatever you tell me, you may rely upon my keeping to myself—if that’s"

"10134",159,"He was on the point of beginning, and then shook his head, doubtfully."

"10136",159,"“Don’t,” said I. “It is all the same to me. After all, it is better to"
"10137",159,"keep your secret. There’s nothing gained but a little relief if I"
"10138",159,"respect your confidence. If I don’t—well?”"
"10139",159,""
"10140",159,"He grunted undecidedly. I felt I had him at a disadvantage, had caught"
"10141",159,"him in the mood of indiscretion; and to tell the truth I was not"
"10142",159,"curious to learn what might have driven a young medical student out of"
"10143",159,"London. I have an imagination. I shrugged my shoulders and turned away."
"10144",159,"Over the taffrail leant a silent black figure, watching the stars. It"
"10145",159,"was Montgomery’s strange attendant. It looked over its shoulder quickly"
"10146",159,"with my movement, then looked away again."
"10147",159,""
"10148",159,"It may seem a little thing to you, perhaps, but it came like a sudden"
"10149",159,"blow to me. The only light near us was a lantern at the wheel. The"
"10150",159,"creature’s face was turned for one brief instant out of the dimness of"
"10151",159,"the stern towards this illumination, and I saw that the eyes that"
"10152",159,"glanced at me shone with a pale-green light. I did not know then that a"
"10153",159,"reddish luminosity, at least, is not uncommon in human eyes. The thing"
"10154",159,"came to me as stark inhumanity. That black figure with its eyes of fire"
"10155",159,"struck down through all my adult thoughts and feelings, and for a"
"10156",159,"moment the forgotten horrors of childhood came back to my mind. Then"
"10157",159,"the effect passed as it had come. An uncouth black figure of a man, a"
"10158",159,"figure of no particular import, hung over the taffrail against the"
"10159",159,"starlight, and I found Montgomery was speaking to me."
"10160",159,""
"10161",159,"“I’m thinking of turning in, then,” said he, “if you’ve had enough of"
"10162",159,"this.”"
"10163",159,""
"10164",159,"I answered him incongruously. We went below, and he wished me"
"10165",159,"good-night at the door of my cabin."
"10166",159,""
"10167",159,"That night I had some very unpleasant dreams. The waning moon rose"
"10168",159,"late. Its light struck a ghostly white beam across my cabin, and made"
"10169",159,"an ominous shape on the planking by my bunk. Then the staghounds woke,"
"10170",159,"and began howling and baying; so that I dreamt fitfully, and scarcely"
"10171",159,"slept until the approach of dawn."

"10179",159,""
"10180",159,"In the early morning (it was the second morning after my recovery, and"
"10181",159,"I believe the fourth after I was picked up), I awoke through an avenue"
"10182",159,"of tumultuous dreams,—dreams of guns and howling mobs,—and became"
"10183",159,"sensible of a hoarse shouting above me. I rubbed my eyes and lay"
"10184",159,"listening to the noise, doubtful for a little while of my whereabouts."
"10185",159,"Then came a sudden pattering of bare feet, the sound of heavy objects"
"10186",159,"being thrown about, a violent creaking and the rattling of chains. I"
"10187",159,"heard the swish of the water as the ship was suddenly brought round,"
"10188",159,"and a foamy yellow-green wave flew across the little round window and"

"10191",159,"As I came up the ladder I saw against the flushed sky—for the sun was"

"10210",159,"“Prendick,” said I."

"10214",159,""
"10215",159,"It was no good answering the brute; but I certainly did not expect his"

"10230",159,"I stared at him dumfounded. Then it occurred to me that it was exactly"
"10231",159,"the thing I wanted. The lost prospect of a journey as sole passenger"
"10232",159,"with this quarrelsome sot was not one to mourn over. I turned towards"
"10233",159,"Montgomery."
"10234",159,""
"10235",159,"“Can’t have you,” said Montgomery’s companion, concisely."

"10240",159,"“Look here,” I began, turning to the captain."

"10244",159,"they can’t have you, you goes overboard. But, anyhow, you go—with your"
"10245",159,"friends. I’ve done with this blessed island for evermore, amen! I’ve"

"10248",159,"“But, Montgomery,” I appealed."
"10249",159,""
"10250",159,"He distorted his lower lip, and nodded his head hopelessly at the"
"10251",159,"grey-haired man beside him, to indicate his powerlessness to help me."

"10253",159,"“I’ll see to _you_, presently,” said the captain."

"10255",159,"Then began a curious three-cornered altercation. Alternately I appealed"
"10256",159,"to one and another of the three men,—first to the grey-haired man to"
"10257",159,"let me land, and then to the drunken captain to keep me aboard. I even"
"10258",159,"bawled entreaties to the sailors. Montgomery said never a word, only"
"10259",159,"shook his head. “You’re going overboard, I tell you,” was the captain’s"
"10260",159,"refrain. “Law be damned! I’m king here.” At last I must confess my"
"10261",159,"voice suddenly broke in the middle of a vigorous threat. I felt a gust"
"10262",159,"of hysterical petulance, and went aft and stared dismally at nothing."
"10263",159,""
"10264",159,"Meanwhile the sailors progressed rapidly with the task of unshipping"
"10265",159,"the packages and caged animals. A large launch, with two standing lugs,"
"10266",159,"lay under the lee of the schooner; and into this the strange assortment"
"10267",159,"of goods were swung. I did not then see the hands from the island that"
"10268",159,"were receiving the packages, for the hull of the launch was hidden from"
"10269",159,"me by the side of the schooner. Neither Montgomery nor his companion"
"10270",159,"took the slightest notice of me, but busied themselves in assisting and"
"10271",159,"directing the four or five sailors who were unloading the goods. The"
"10272",159,"captain went forward interfering rather than assisting. I was"
"10273",159,"alternately despairful and desperate. Once or twice as I stood waiting"
"10274",159,"there for things to accomplish themselves, I could not resist an"
"10275",159,"impulse to laugh at my miserable quandary. I felt all the wretcheder"
"10276",159,"for the lack of a breakfast. Hunger and a lack of blood-corpuscles take"
"10277",159,"all the manhood from a man. I perceived pretty clearly that I had not"
"10278",159,"the stamina either to resist what the captain chose to do to expel me,"
"10279",159,"or to force myself upon Montgomery and his companion. So I waited"
"10280",159,"passively upon fate; and the work of transferring Montgomery’s"
"10281",159,"possessions to the launch went on as if I did not exist."
"10282",159,""
"10283",159,"Presently that work was finished, and then came a struggle. I was"
"10284",159,"hauled, resisting weakly enough, to the gangway. Even then I noticed"
"10285",159,"the oddness of the brown faces of the men who were with Montgomery in"
"10286",159,"the launch; but the launch was now fully laden, and was shoved off"
"10287",159,"hastily. A broadening gap of green water appeared under me, and I"
"10288",159,"pushed back with all my strength to avoid falling headlong. The hands"
"10289",159,"in the launch shouted derisively, and I heard Montgomery curse at them;"
"10290",159,"and then the captain, the mate, and one of the seamen helping him, ran"
"10291",159,"me aft towards the stern."
"10292",159,""
"10293",159,"The dingey of the _Lady Vain_ had been towing behind; it was half full"
"10294",159,"of water, had no oars, and was quite unvictualled. I refused to go"
"10295",159,"aboard her, and flung myself full length on the deck. In the end, they"
"10296",159,"swung me into her by a rope (for they had no stern ladder), and then"
"10297",159,"they cut me adrift. I drifted slowly from the schooner. In a kind of"
"10298",159,"stupor I watched all hands take to the rigging, and slowly but surely"
"10299",159,"she came round to the wind; the sails fluttered, and then bellied out"
"10300",159,"as the wind came into them. I stared at her weather-beaten side heeling"
"10301",159,"steeply towards me; and then she passed out of my range of view."
"10302",159,""
"10303",159,"I did not turn my head to follow her. At first I could scarcely believe"
"10304",159,"what had happened. I crouched in the bottom of the dingey, stunned, and"
"10305",159,"staring blankly at the vacant, oily sea. Then I realised that I was in"
"10306",159,"that little hell of mine again, now half swamped; and looking back over"
"10307",159,"the gunwale, I saw the schooner standing away from me, with the"
"10308",159,"red-haired captain mocking at me over the taffrail, and turning towards"
"10309",159,"the island saw the launch growing smaller as she approached the beach."
"10310",159,""
"10311",159,"Abruptly the cruelty of this desertion became clear to me. I had no"
"10312",159,"means of reaching the land unless I should chance to drift there. I was"
"10313",159,"still weak, you must remember, from my exposure in the boat; I was"
"10314",159,"empty and very faint, or I should have had more heart. But as it was I"
"10315",159,"suddenly began to sob and weep, as I had never done since I was a"
"10316",159,"little child. The tears ran down my face. In a passion of despair I"
"10317",159,"struck with my fists at the water in the bottom of the boat, and kicked"
"10318",159,"savagely at the gunwale. I prayed aloud for God to let me die."

"10324",159,"THE EVIL-LOOKING BOATMEN."
"10325",159,""
"10326",159,""
"10327",159,"But the islanders, seeing that I was really adrift, took pity on me. I"
"10328",159,"drifted very slowly to the eastward, approaching the island slantingly;"
"10329",159,"and presently I saw, with hysterical relief, the launch come round and"
"10330",159,"return towards me. She was heavily laden, and I could make out as she"
"10331",159,"drew nearer Montgomery’s white-haired, broad-shouldered companion"
"10332",159,"sitting cramped up with the dogs and several packing-cases in the stern"
"10333",159,"sheets. This individual stared fixedly at me without moving or"
"10334",159,"speaking. The black-faced cripple was glaring at me as fixedly in the"
"10335",159,"bows near the puma. There were three other men besides,—three strange"
"10336",159,"brutish-looking fellows, at whom the staghounds were snarling savagely."
"10337",159,"Montgomery, who was steering, brought the boat by me, and rising,"
"10338",159,"caught and fastened my painter to the tiller to tow me, for there was"
"10339",159,"no room aboard."
"10340",159,""
"10341",159,"I had recovered from my hysterical phase by this time and answered his"
"10342",159,"hail, as he approached, bravely enough. I told him the dingey was"
"10343",159,"nearly swamped, and he reached me a piggin. I was jerked back as the"
"10344",159,"rope tightened between the boats. For some time I was busy baling."
"10345",159,""
"10346",159,"It was not until I had got the water under (for the water in the dingey"
"10347",159,"had been shipped; the boat was perfectly sound) that I had leisure to"
"10348",159,"look at the people in the launch again."
"10349",159,""
"10350",159,"The white-haired man I found was still regarding me steadfastly, but"
"10351",159,"with an expression, as I now fancied, of some perplexity. When my eyes"
"10352",159,"met his, he looked down at the staghound that sat between his knees. He"
"10353",159,"was a powerfully-built man, as I have said, with a fine forehead and"
"10354",159,"rather heavy features; but his eyes had that odd drooping of the skin"
"10355",159,"above the lids which often comes with advancing years, and the fall of"
"10356",159,"his heavy mouth at the corners gave him an expression of pugnacious"
"10357",159,"resolution. He talked to Montgomery in a tone too low for me to hear."
"10358",159,""
"10359",159,"From him my eyes travelled to his three men; and a strange crew they"
"10360",159,"were. I saw only their faces, yet there was something in their faces—I"
"10361",159,"knew not what—that gave me a queer spasm of disgust. I looked steadily"
"10362",159,"at them, and the impression did not pass, though I failed to see what"
"10363",159,"had occasioned it. They seemed to me then to be brown men; but their"
"10364",159,"limbs were oddly swathed in some thin, dirty, white stuff down even to"
"10365",159,"the fingers and feet: I have never seen men so wrapped up before, and"
"10366",159,"women so only in the East. They wore turbans too, and thereunder peered"
"10367",159,"out their elfin faces at me,—faces with protruding lower-jaws and"
"10368",159,"bright eyes. They had lank black hair, almost like horsehair, and"
"10369",159,"seemed as they sat to exceed in stature any race of men I have seen."
"10370",159,"The white-haired man, who I knew was a good six feet in height, sat a"
"10371",159,"head below any one of the three. I found afterwards that really none"
"10372",159,"were taller than myself; but their bodies were abnormally long, and the"
"10373",159,"thigh-part of the leg short and curiously twisted. At any rate, they"
"10374",159,"were an amazingly ugly gang, and over the heads of them under the"
"10375",159,"forward lug peered the black face of the man whose eyes were luminous"
"10376",159,"in the dark. As I stared at them, they met my gaze; and then first one"
"10377",159,"and then another turned away from my direct stare, and looked at me in"
"10378",159,"an odd, furtive manner. It occurred to me that I was perhaps annoying"
"10379",159,"them, and I turned my attention to the island we were approaching."
"10380",159,""
"10381",159,"It was low, and covered with thick vegetation,—chiefly a kind of palm,"
"10382",159,"that was new to me. From one point a thin white thread of vapour rose"
"10383",159,"slantingly to an immense height, and then frayed out like a down"
"10384",159,"feather. We were now within the embrace of a broad bay flanked on"
"10385",159,"either hand by a low promontory. The beach was of dull-grey sand, and"
"10386",159,"sloped steeply up to a ridge, perhaps sixty or seventy feet above the"
"10387",159,"sea-level, and irregularly set with trees and undergrowth. Half way up"
"10388",159,"was a square enclosure of some greyish stone, which I found"
"10389",159,"subsequently was built partly of coral and partly of pumiceous lava."
"10390",159,"Two thatched roofs peeped from within this enclosure. A man stood"
"10391",159,"awaiting us at the water’s edge. I fancied while we were still far off"
"10392",159,"that I saw some other and very grotesque-looking creatures scuttle into"
"10393",159,"the bushes upon the slope; but I saw nothing of these as we drew"
"10394",159,"nearer. This man was of a moderate size, and with a black negroid face."
"10395",159,"He had a large, almost lipless, mouth, extraordinary lank arms, long"
"10396",159,"thin feet, and bow-legs, and stood with his heavy face thrust forward"
"10397",159,"staring at us. He was dressed like Montgomery and his white-haired"
"10398",159,"companion, in jacket and trousers of blue serge. As we came still"
"10399",159,"nearer, this individual began to run to and fro on the beach, making"
"10400",159,"the most grotesque movements."
"10401",159,""
"10402",159,"At a word of command from Montgomery, the four men in the launch sprang"
"10403",159,"up, and with singularly awkward gestures struck the lugs. Montgomery"
"10404",159,"steered us round and into a narrow little dock excavated in the beach."
"10405",159,"Then the man on the beach hastened towards us. This dock, as I call it,"
"10406",159,"was really a mere ditch just long enough at this phase of the tide to"
"10407",159,"take the longboat. I heard the bows ground in the sand, staved the"
"10408",159,"dingey off the rudder of the big boat with my piggin, and freeing the"
"10409",159,"painter, landed. The three muffled men, with the clumsiest movements,"
"10410",159,"scrambled out upon the sand, and forthwith set to landing the cargo,"
"10411",159,"assisted by the man on the beach. I was struck especially by the"
"10412",159,"curious movements of the legs of the three swathed and bandaged"
"10413",159,"boatmen,—not stiff they were, but distorted in some odd way, almost as"
"10414",159,"if they were jointed in the wrong place. The dogs were still snarling,"
"10415",159,"and strained at their chains after these men, as the white-haired man"
"10416",159,"landed with them. The three big fellows spoke to one another in odd"
"10417",159,"guttural tones, and the man who had waited for us on the beach began"
"10418",159,"chattering to them excitedly—a foreign language, as I fancied—as they"
"10419",159,"laid hands on some bales piled near the stern. Somewhere I had heard"
"10420",159,"such a voice before, and I could not think where. The white-haired man"
"10421",159,"stood, holding in a tumult of six dogs, and bawling orders over their"
"10422",159,"din. Montgomery, having unshipped the rudder, landed likewise, and all"
"10423",159,"set to work at unloading. I was too faint, what with my long fast and"
"10424",159,"the sun beating down on my bare head, to offer any assistance."
"10425",159,""
"10426",159,"Presently the white-haired man seemed to recollect my presence, and"
"10427",159,"came up to me."
"10428",159,""
"10429",159,"“You look,” said he, “as though you had scarcely breakfasted.” His"
"10430",159,"little eyes were a brilliant black under his heavy brows. “I must"
"10431",159,"apologise for that. Now you are our guest, we must make you"
"10432",159,"comfortable,—though you are uninvited, you know.” He looked keenly into"
"10433",159,"my face. “Montgomery says you are an educated man, Mr. Prendick; says"
"10434",159,"you know something of science. May I ask what that signifies?”"
"10435",159,""
"10436",159,"I told him I had spent some years at the Royal College of Science, and"
"10437",159,"had done some researches in biology under Huxley. He raised his"
"10438",159,"eyebrows slightly at that."
"10439",159,""
"10440",159,"“That alters the case a little, Mr. Prendick,” he said, with a trifle"
"10441",159,"more respect in his manner. “As it happens, we are biologists here."
"10442",159,"This is a biological station—of a sort.” His eye rested on the men in"
"10443",159,"white who were busily hauling the puma, on rollers, towards the walled"
"10444",159,"yard. “I and Montgomery, at least,” he added. Then, “When you will be"
"10445",159,"able to get away, I can’t say. We’re off the track to anywhere. We see"
"10446",159,"a ship once in a twelve-month or so.”"
"10447",159,""
"10448",159,"He left me abruptly, and went up the beach past this group, and I think"
"10449",159,"entered the enclosure. The other two men were with Montgomery, erecting"
"10450",159,"a pile of smaller packages on a low-wheeled truck. The llama was still"
"10451",159,"on the launch with the rabbit hutches; the staghounds were still lashed"
"10452",159,"to the thwarts. The pile of things completed, all three men laid hold"
"10453",159,"of the truck and began shoving the ton-weight or so upon it after the"
"10454",159,"puma. Presently Montgomery left them, and coming back to me held out"
"10455",159,"his hand."
"10456",159,""
"10457",159,"“I’m glad,” said he, “for my own part. That captain was a silly ass."
"10458",159,"He’d have made things lively for you.”"
"10459",159,""
"10460",159,"“It was you,” said I, “that saved me again.”"
"10461",159,""
"10462",159,"“That depends. You’ll find this island an infernally rum place, I"
"10463",159,"promise you. I’d watch my goings carefully, if I were you. _He_—” He"
"10464",159,"hesitated, and seemed to alter his mind about what was on his lips. “I"
"10465",159,"wish you’d help me with these rabbits,” he said."
"10466",159,""
"10467",159,"His procedure with the rabbits was singular. I waded in with him, and"
"10468",159,"helped him lug one of the hutches ashore. No sooner was that done than"
"10469",159,"he opened the door of it, and tilting the thing on one end turned its"
"10470",159,"living contents out on the ground. They fell in a struggling heap one"
"10471",159,"on the top of the other. He clapped his hands, and forthwith they went"
"10472",159,"off with that hopping run of theirs, fifteen or twenty of them I should"
"10473",159,"think, up the beach."
"10474",159,""
"10475",159,"“Increase and multiply, my friends,” said Montgomery. “Replenish the"
"10476",159,"island. Hitherto we’ve had a certain lack of meat here.”"
"10477",159,""
"10478",159,"As I watched them disappearing, the white-haired man returned with a"
"10479",159,"brandy-flask and some biscuits. “Something to go on with, Prendick,”"
"10480",159,"said he, in a far more familiar tone than before. I made no ado, but"
"10481",159,"set to work on the biscuits at once, while the white-haired man helped"
"10482",159,"Montgomery to release about a score more of the rabbits. Three big"
"10483",159,"hutches, however, went up to the house with the puma. The brandy I did"
"10484",159,"not touch, for I have been an abstainer from my birth."

"10493",159,"The reader will perhaps understand that at first everything was so"
"10494",159,"strange about me, and my position was the outcome of such unexpected"
"10495",159,"adventures, that I had no discernment of the relative strangeness of"
"10496",159,"this or that thing. I followed the llama up the beach, and was"
"10497",159,"overtaken by Montgomery, who asked me not to enter the stone enclosure."
"10498",159,"I noticed then that the puma in its cage and the pile of packages had"
"10499",159,"been placed outside the entrance to this quadrangle."
"10500",159,""
"10501",159,"I turned and saw that the launch had now been unloaded, run out again,"
"10502",159,"and was being beached, and the white-haired man was walking towards us."
"10503",159,"He addressed Montgomery."
"10504",159,""
"10505",159,"“And now comes the problem of this uninvited guest. What are we to do"

"10508",159,"“He knows something of science,” said Montgomery."
"10509",159,""
"10510",159,"“I’m itching to get to work again—with this new stuff,” said the"
"10511",159,"white-haired man, nodding towards the enclosure. His eyes grew"
"10512",159,"brighter."
"10513",159,""
"10514",159,"“I daresay you are,” said Montgomery, in anything but a cordial tone."

"10516",159,"“We can’t send him over there, and we can’t spare the time to build him"
"10517",159,"a new shanty; and we certainly can’t take him into our confidence just"
"10518",159,"yet.”"
"10519",159,""
"10520",159,"“I’m in your hands,” said I. I had no idea of what he meant by “over"
"10521",159,"there.”"
"10522",159,""
"10523",159,"“I’ve been thinking of the same things,” Montgomery answered. “There’s"
"10524",159,"my room with the outer door—”"
"10525",159,""
"10526",159,"“That’s it,” said the elder man, promptly, looking at Montgomery; and"
"10527",159,"all three of us went towards the enclosure. “I’m sorry to make a"
"10528",159,"mystery, Mr. Prendick; but you’ll remember you’re uninvited. Our little"
"10529",159,"establishment here contains a secret or so, is a kind of Blue-Beard’s"
"10530",159,"chamber, in fact. Nothing very dreadful, really, to a sane man; but"
"10531",159,"just now, as we don’t know you—”"
"10532",159,""
"10533",159,"“Decidedly,” said I, “I should be a fool to take offence at any want of"
"10534",159,"confidence.”"
"10535",159,""
"10536",159,"He twisted his heavy mouth into a faint smile—he was one of those"
"10537",159,"saturnine people who smile with the corners of the mouth down,—and"
"10538",159,"bowed his acknowledgment of my complaisance. The main entrance to the"
"10539",159,"enclosure was passed; it was a heavy wooden gate, framed in iron and"
"10540",159,"locked, with the cargo of the launch piled outside it, and at the"
"10541",159,"corner we came to a small doorway I had not previously observed. The"
"10542",159,"white-haired man produced a bundle of keys from the pocket of his"
"10543",159,"greasy blue jacket, opened this door, and entered. His keys, and the"
"10544",159,"elaborate locking-up of the place even while it was still under his"
"10545",159,"eye, struck me as peculiar. I followed him, and found myself in a small"
"10546",159,"apartment, plainly but not uncomfortably furnished and with its inner"
"10547",159,"door, which was slightly ajar, opening into a paved courtyard. This"
"10548",159,"inner door Montgomery at once closed. A hammock was slung across the"
"10549",159,"darker corner of the room, and a small unglazed window defended by an"
"10550",159,"iron bar looked out towards the sea."
"10551",159,""
"10552",159,"This the white-haired man told me was to be my apartment; and the inner"
"10553",159,"door, which “for fear of accidents,” he said, he would lock on the"
"10554",159,"other side, was my limit inward. He called my attention to a convenient"
"10555",159,"deck-chair before the window, and to an array of old books, chiefly, I"
"10556",159,"found, surgical works and editions of the Latin and Greek classics"
"10557",159,"(languages I cannot read with any comfort), on a shelf near the"
"10558",159,"hammock. He left the room by the outer door, as if to avoid opening the"
"10559",159,"inner one again."

"10561",159,"“We usually have our meals in here,” said Montgomery, and then, as if"
"10562",159,"in doubt, went out after the other. “Moreau!” I heard him call, and for"
"10563",159,"the moment I do not think I noticed. Then as I handled the books on the"
"10564",159,"shelf it came up in consciousness: Where had I heard the name of Moreau"
"10565",159,"before? I sat down before the window, took out the biscuits that still"
"10566",159,"remained to me, and ate them with an excellent appetite. Moreau!"
"10567",159,""
"10568",159,"Through the window I saw one of those unaccountable men in white,"
"10569",159,"lugging a packing-case along the beach. Presently the window-frame hid"
"10570",159,"him. Then I heard a key inserted and turned in the lock behind me."
"10571",159,"After a little while I heard through the locked door the noise of the"
"10572",159,"staghounds, that had now been brought up from the beach. They were not"
"10573",159,"barking, but sniffing and growling in a curious fashion. I could hear"
"10574",159,"the rapid patter of their feet, and Montgomery’s voice soothing them."
"10575",159,""
"10576",159,"I was very much impressed by the elaborate secrecy of these two men"
"10577",159,"regarding the contents of the place, and for some time I was thinking"
"10578",159,"of that and of the unaccountable familiarity of the name of Moreau; but"
"10579",159,"so odd is the human memory that I could not then recall that well-known"
"10580",159,"name in its proper connection. From that my thoughts went to the"
"10581",159,"indefinable queerness of the deformed man on the beach. I never saw"
"10582",159,"such a gait, such odd motions as he pulled at the box. I recalled that"
"10583",159,"none of these men had spoken to me, though most of them I had found"
"10584",159,"looking at me at one time or another in a peculiarly furtive manner,"
"10585",159,"quite unlike the frank stare of your unsophisticated savage. Indeed,"
"10586",159,"they had all seemed remarkably taciturn, and when they did speak,"
"10587",159,"endowed with very uncanny voices. What was wrong with them? Then I"
"10588",159,"recalled the eyes of Montgomery’s ungainly attendant."
"10589",159,""
"10590",159,"Just as I was thinking of him he came in. He was now dressed in white,"
"10591",159,"and carried a little tray with some coffee and boiled vegetables"
"10592",159,"thereon. I could hardly repress a shuddering recoil as he came, bending"
"10593",159,"amiably, and placed the tray before me on the table. Then astonishment"
"10594",159,"paralysed me. Under his stringy black locks I saw his ear; it jumped"
"10595",159,"upon me suddenly close to my face. The man had pointed ears, covered"
"10596",159,"with a fine brown fur!"
"10597",159,""
"10598",159,"“Your breakfast, sair,” he said."
"10599",159,""
"10600",159,"I stared at his face without attempting to answer him. He turned and"
"10601",159,"went towards the door, regarding me oddly over his shoulder. I followed"
"10602",159,"him out with my eyes; and as I did so, by some odd trick of unconscious"
"10603",159,"cerebration, there came surging into my head the phrase, “The Moreau"
"10604",159,"Hollows”—was it? “The Moreau—” Ah! It sent my memory back ten years."
"10605",159,"“The Moreau Horrors!” The phrase drifted loose in my mind for a moment,"
"10606",159,"and then I saw it in red lettering on a little buff-coloured pamphlet,"
"10607",159,"to read which made one shiver and creep. Then I remembered distinctly"
"10608",159,"all about it. That long-forgotten pamphlet came back with startling"
"10609",159,"vividness to my mind. I had been a mere lad then, and Moreau was, I"
"10610",159,"suppose, about fifty,—a prominent and masterful physiologist,"
"10611",159,"well-known in scientific circles for his extraordinary imagination and"
"10612",159,"his brutal directness in discussion."
"10613",159,""
"10614",159,"Was this the same Moreau? He had published some very astonishing facts"
"10615",159,"in connection with the transfusion of blood, and in addition was known"
"10616",159,"to be doing valuable work on morbid growths. Then suddenly his career"
"10617",159,"was closed. He had to leave England. A journalist obtained access to"
"10618",159,"his laboratory in the capacity of laboratory-assistant, with the"
"10619",159,"deliberate intention of making sensational exposures; and by the help"
"10620",159,"of a shocking accident (if it was an accident), his gruesome pamphlet"
"10621",159,"became notorious. On the day of its publication a wretched dog, flayed"
"10622",159,"and otherwise mutilated, escaped from Moreau’s house. It was in the"
"10623",159,"silly season, and a prominent editor, a cousin of the temporary"
"10624",159,"laboratory-assistant, appealed to the conscience of the nation. It was"
"10625",159,"not the first time that conscience has turned against the methods of"
"10626",159,"research. The doctor was simply howled out of the country. It may be"
"10627",159,"that he deserved to be; but I still think that the tepid support of his"
"10628",159,"fellow-investigators and his desertion by the great body of scientific"
"10629",159,"workers was a shameful thing. Yet some of his experiments, by the"
"10630",159,"journalist’s account, were wantonly cruel. He might perhaps have"
"10631",159,"purchased his social peace by abandoning his investigations; but he"
"10632",159,"apparently preferred the latter, as most men would who have once fallen"
"10633",159,"under the overmastering spell of research. He was unmarried, and had"
"10634",159,"indeed nothing but his own interest to consider."
"10635",159,""
"10636",159,"I felt convinced that this must be the same man. Everything pointed to"
"10637",159,"it. It dawned upon me to what end the puma and the other animals—which"
"10638",159,"had now been brought with other luggage into the enclosure behind the"
"10639",159,"house—were destined; and a curious faint odour, the halitus of"
"10640",159,"something familiar, an odour that had been in the background of my"
"10641",159,"consciousness hitherto, suddenly came forward into the forefront of my"
"10642",159,"thoughts. It was the antiseptic odour of the dissecting-room. I heard"
"10643",159,"the puma growling through the wall, and one of the dogs yelped as"
"10644",159,"though it had been struck."
"10645",159,""
"10646",159,"Yet surely, and especially to another scientific man, there was nothing"
"10647",159,"so horrible in vivisection as to account for this secrecy; and by some"
"10648",159,"odd leap in my thoughts the pointed ears and luminous eyes of"
"10649",159,"Montgomery’s attendant came back again before me with the sharpest"
"10650",159,"definition. I stared before me out at the green sea, frothing under a"
"10651",159,"freshening breeze, and let these and other strange memories of the last"
"10652",159,"few days chase one another through my mind."

"10664",159,"Montgomery interrupted my tangle of mystification and suspicion about"
"10665",159,"one o’clock, and his grotesque attendant followed him with a tray"
"10666",159,"bearing bread, some herbs and other eatables, a flask of whiskey, a jug"
"10667",159,"of water, and three glasses and knives. I glanced askance at this"
"10668",159,"strange creature, and found him watching me with his queer, restless"
"10669",159,"eyes. Montgomery said he would lunch with me, but that Moreau was too"

"10681",159,"stolen. It was that infernal stuff which led to my coming here,—that,"
"10682",159,"and a foggy night. I thought myself in luck at the time, when Moreau"
"10683",159,"offered to get me off. It’s queer—”"

"10691",159,"“Little points to them,” said I, as calmly as possible, with a catch in"
"10692",159,"my breath; “and a fine black fur at the edges?”"

"10694",159,"He helped himself to whiskey and water with great deliberation. “I was"

"10702",159,"of his flavouring of lisp, “that there _was_ something the matter with"
"10703",159,"his ears, from the way he covered them. What were they like?”"
"10704",159,""
"10705",159,"I was persuaded from his manner that this ignorance was a pretence."
"10706",159,"Still, I could hardly tell the man that I thought him a liar."
"10707",159,"“Pointed,” I said; “rather small and furry,—distinctly furry. But the"
"10708",159,"whole man is one of the strangest beings I ever set eyes on.”"
"10709",159,""
"10710",159,"A sharp, hoarse cry of animal pain came from the enclosure behind us."
"10711",159,"Its depth and volume testified to the puma. I saw Montgomery wince."
"10712",159,""
"10713",159,"“Yes?” he said."

"10715",159,"“Where did you pick up the creature?”"

"10717",159,"“San Francisco. He’s an ugly brute, I admit. Half-witted, you know."
"10718",159,"Can’t remember where he came from. But I’m used to him, you know. We"
"10719",159,"both are. How does he strike you?”"
"10720",159,""
"10721",159,"“He’s unnatural,” I said. “There’s something about him—don’t think me"
"10722",159,"fanciful, but it gives me a nasty little sensation, a tightening of my"
"10723",159,"muscles, when he comes near me. It’s a touch—of the diabolical, in"
"10724",159,"fact.”"
"10725",159,""
"10726",159,"Montgomery had stopped eating while I told him this. “Rum!” he said."
"10727",159,"“_I_ can’t see it.” He resumed his meal. “I had no idea of it,” he"
"10728",159,"said, and masticated. “The crew of the schooner must have felt it the"
"10729",159,"same. Made a dead set at the poor devil. You saw the captain?”"

"10731",159,"Suddenly the puma howled again, this time more painfully. Montgomery"
"10732",159,"swore under his breath. I had half a mind to attack him about the men"
"10733",159,"on the beach. Then the poor brute within gave vent to a series of"
"10734",159,"short, sharp cries."

"10736",159,"“Your men on the beach,” said I; “what race are they?”"

"10738",159,"“Excellent fellows, aren’t they?” said he, absentmindedly, knitting his"
"10739",159,"brows as the animal yelled out sharply."

"10741",159,"I said no more. There was another outcry worse than the former. He"
"10742",159,"looked at me with his dull grey eyes, and then took some more whiskey."
"10743",159,"He tried to draw me into a discussion about alcohol, professing to have"
"10744",159,"saved my life with it. He seemed anxious to lay stress on the fact that"
"10745",159,"I owed my life to him. I answered him distractedly."
"10746",159,""
"10747",159,"Presently our meal came to an end; the misshapen monster with the"
"10748",159,"pointed ears cleared the remains away, and Montgomery left me alone in"
"10749",159,"the room again. All the time he had been in a state of ill-concealed"
"10750",159,"irritation at the noise of the vivisected puma. He had spoken of his"
"10751",159,"odd want of nerve, and left me to the obvious application."
"10752",159,""
"10753",159,"I found myself that the cries were singularly irritating, and they grew"
"10754",159,"in depth and intensity as the afternoon wore on. They were painful at"
"10755",159,"first, but their constant resurgence at last altogether upset my"
"10756",159,"balance. I flung aside a crib of Horace I had been reading, and began"
"10757",159,"to clench my fists, to bite my lips, and to pace the room. Presently I"
"10758",159,"got to stopping my ears with my fingers."
"10759",159,""
"10760",159,"The emotional appeal of those yells grew upon me steadily, grew at last"
"10761",159,"to such an exquisite expression of suffering that I could stand it in"
"10762",159,"that confined room no longer. I stepped out of the door into the"
"10763",159,"slumberous heat of the late afternoon, and walking past the main"
"10764",159,"entrance—locked again, I noticed—turned the corner of the wall."
"10765",159,""
"10766",159,"The crying sounded even louder out of doors. It was as if all the pain"
"10767",159,"in the world had found a voice. Yet had I known such pain was in the"
"10768",159,"next room, and had it been dumb, I believe—I have thought since—I could"
"10769",159,"have stood it well enough. It is when suffering finds a voice and sets"
"10770",159,"our nerves quivering that this pity comes troubling us. But in spite of"
"10771",159,"the brilliant sunlight and the green fans of the trees waving in the"
"10772",159,"soothing sea-breeze, the world was a confusion, blurred with drifting"

"10782",159,""
"10783",159,"I strode through the undergrowth that clothed the ridge behind the"
"10784",159,"house, scarcely heeding whither I went; passed on through the shadow of"
"10785",159,"a thick cluster of straight-stemmed trees beyond it, and so presently"
"10786",159,"found myself some way on the other side of the ridge, and descending"
"10787",159,"towards a streamlet that ran through a narrow valley. I paused and"
"10788",159,"listened. The distance I had come, or the intervening masses of"
"10789",159,"thicket, deadened any sound that might be coming from the enclosure."
"10790",159,"The air was still. Then with a rustle a rabbit emerged, and went"
"10791",159,"scampering up the slope before me. I hesitated, and sat down in the"
"10792",159,"edge of the shade."
"10793",159,""
"10794",159,"The place was a pleasant one. The rivulet was hidden by the luxuriant"
"10795",159,"vegetation of the banks save at one point, where I caught a triangular"
"10796",159,"patch of its glittering water. On the farther side I saw through a"
"10797",159,"bluish haze a tangle of trees and creepers, and above these again the"
"10798",159,"luminous blue of the sky. Here and there a splash of white or crimson"
"10799",159,"marked the blooming of some trailing epiphyte. I let my eyes wander"
"10800",159,"over this scene for a while, and then began to turn over in my mind"
"10801",159,"again the strange peculiarities of Montgomery’s man. But it was too hot"
"10802",159,"to think elaborately, and presently I fell into a tranquil state midway"
"10803",159,"between dozing and waking."
"10804",159,""
"10805",159,"From this I was aroused, after I know not how long, by a rustling"
"10806",159,"amidst the greenery on the other side of the stream. For a moment I"
"10807",159,"could see nothing but the waving summits of the ferns and reeds. Then"
"10808",159,"suddenly upon the bank of the stream appeared something—at first I"
"10809",159,"could not distinguish what it was. It bowed its round head to the"
"10810",159,"water, and began to drink. Then I saw it was a man, going on all-fours"
"10811",159,"like a beast. He was clothed in bluish cloth, and was of a"
"10812",159,"copper-coloured hue, with black hair. It seemed that grotesque ugliness"
"10813",159,"was an invariable character of these islanders. I could hear the suck"
"10814",159,"of the water at his lips as he drank."
"10815",159,""
"10816",159,"I leant forward to see him better, and a piece of lava, detached by my"
"10817",159,"hand, went pattering down the slope. He looked up guiltily, and his"
"10818",159,"eyes met mine. Forthwith he scrambled to his feet, and stood wiping his"
"10819",159,"clumsy hand across his mouth and regarding me. His legs were scarcely"
"10820",159,"half the length of his body. So, staring one another out of"
"10821",159,"countenance, we remained for perhaps the space of a minute. Then,"
"10822",159,"stopping to look back once or twice, he slunk off among the bushes to"
"10823",159,"the right of me, and I heard the swish of the fronds grow faint in the"
"10824",159,"distance and die away. Long after he had disappeared, I remained"
"10825",159,"sitting up staring in the direction of his retreat. My drowsy"
"10826",159,"tranquillity had gone."
"10827",159,""
"10828",159,"I was startled by a noise behind me, and turning suddenly saw the"
"10829",159,"flapping white tail of a rabbit vanishing up the slope. I jumped to my"
"10830",159,"feet. The apparition of this grotesque, half-bestial creature had"
"10831",159,"suddenly populated the stillness of the afternoon for me. I looked"
"10832",159,"around me rather nervously, and regretted that I was unarmed. Then I"
"10833",159,"thought that the man I had just seen had been clothed in bluish cloth,"
"10834",159,"had not been naked as a savage would have been; and I tried to persuade"
"10835",159,"myself from that fact that he was after all probably a peaceful"
"10836",159,"character, that the dull ferocity of his countenance belied him."
"10837",159,""
"10838",159,"Yet I was greatly disturbed at the apparition. I walked to the left"
"10839",159,"along the slope, turning my head about and peering this way and that"
"10840",159,"among the straight stems of the trees. Why should a man go on all-fours"
"10841",159,"and drink with his lips? Presently I heard an animal wailing again, and"
"10842",159,"taking it to be the puma, I turned about and walked in a direction"
"10843",159,"diametrically opposite to the sound. This led me down to the stream,"
"10844",159,"across which I stepped and pushed my way up through the undergrowth"
"10845",159,"beyond."
"10846",159,""
"10847",159,"I was startled by a great patch of vivid scarlet on the ground, and"
"10848",159,"going up to it found it to be a peculiar fungus, branched and"
"10849",159,"corrugated like a foliaceous lichen, but deliquescing into slime at the"
"10850",159,"touch; and then in the shadow of some luxuriant ferns I came upon an"
"10851",159,"unpleasant thing,—the dead body of a rabbit covered with shining flies,"
"10852",159,"but still warm and with the head torn off. I stopped aghast at the"
"10853",159,"sight of the scattered blood. Here at least was one visitor to the"
"10854",159,"island disposed of! There were no traces of other violence about it. It"
"10855",159,"looked as though it had been suddenly snatched up and killed; and as I"
"10856",159,"stared at the little furry body came the difficulty of how the thing"
"10857",159,"had been done. The vague dread that had been in my mind since I had"
"10858",159,"seen the inhuman face of the man at the stream grew distincter as I"
"10859",159,"stood there. I began to realise the hardihood of my expedition among"
"10860",159,"these unknown people. The thicket about me became altered to my"
"10861",159,"imagination. Every shadow became something more than a shadow,—became"
"10862",159,"an ambush; every rustle became a threat. Invisible things seemed"
"10863",159,"watching me. I resolved to go back to the enclosure on the beach. I"
"10864",159,"suddenly turned away and thrust myself violently, possibly even"
"10865",159,"frantically, through the bushes, anxious to get a clear space about me"
"10866",159,"again."
"10867",159,""
"10868",159,"I stopped just in time to prevent myself emerging upon an open space."
"10869",159,"It was a kind of glade in the forest, made by a fall; seedlings were"
"10870",159,"already starting up to struggle for the vacant space; and beyond, the"
"10871",159,"dense growth of stems and twining vines and splashes of fungus and"
"10872",159,"flowers closed in again. Before me, squatting together upon the fungoid"
"10873",159,"ruins of a huge fallen tree and still unaware of my approach, were"
"10874",159,"three grotesque human figures. One was evidently a female; the other"
"10875",159,"two were men. They were naked, save for swathings of scarlet cloth"
"10876",159,"about the middle; and their skins were of a dull pinkish-drab colour,"
"10877",159,"such as I had seen in no savages before. They had fat, heavy, chinless"
"10878",159,"faces, retreating foreheads, and a scant bristly hair upon their heads."
"10879",159,"I never saw such bestial-looking creatures."
"10880",159,""
"10881",159,"They were talking, or at least one of the men was talking to the other"
"10882",159,"two, and all three had been too closely interested to heed the rustling"
"10883",159,"of my approach. They swayed their heads and shoulders from side to"
"10884",159,"side. The speaker’s words came thick and sloppy, and though I could"
"10885",159,"hear them distinctly I could not distinguish what he said. He seemed to"
"10886",159,"me to be reciting some complicated gibberish. Presently his"
"10887",159,"articulation became shriller, and spreading his hands he rose to his"
"10888",159,"feet. At that the others began to gibber in unison, also rising to"
"10889",159,"their feet, spreading their hands and swaying their bodies in rhythm"
"10890",159,"with their chant. I noticed then the abnormal shortness of their legs,"
"10891",159,"and their lank, clumsy feet. All three began slowly to circle round,"
"10892",159,"raising and stamping their feet and waving their arms; a kind of tune"
"10893",159,"crept into their rhythmic recitation, and a refrain,—“Aloola,” or"
"10894",159,"“Balloola,” it sounded like. Their eyes began to sparkle, and their"
"10895",159,"ugly faces to brighten, with an expression of strange pleasure. Saliva"
"10896",159,"dripped from their lipless mouths."
"10897",159,""
"10898",159,"Suddenly, as I watched their grotesque and unaccountable gestures, I"
"10899",159,"perceived clearly for the first time what it was that had offended me,"
"10900",159,"what had given me the two inconsistent and conflicting impressions of"
"10901",159,"utter strangeness and yet of the strangest familiarity. The three"
"10902",159,"creatures engaged in this mysterious rite were human in shape, and yet"
"10903",159,"human beings with the strangest air about them of some familiar animal."
"10904",159,"Each of these creatures, despite its human form, its rag of clothing,"
"10905",159,"and the rough humanity of its bodily form, had woven into it—into its"
"10906",159,"movements, into the expression of its countenance, into its whole"
"10907",159,"presence—some now irresistible suggestion of a hog, a swinish taint,"
"10908",159,"the unmistakable mark of the beast."
"10909",159,""
"10910",159,"I stood overcome by this amazing realisation and then the most horrible"
"10911",159,"questionings came rushing into my mind. They began leaping in the air,"
"10912",159,"first one and then the other, whooping and grunting. Then one slipped,"
"10913",159,"and for a moment was on all-fours,—to recover, indeed, forthwith. But"
"10914",159,"that transitory gleam of the true animalism of these monsters was"
"10915",159,"enough."
"10916",159,""
"10917",159,"I turned as noiselessly as possible, and becoming every now and then"
"10918",159,"rigid with the fear of being discovered, as a branch cracked or a leaf"
"10919",159,"rustled, I pushed back into the bushes. It was long before I grew"
"10920",159,"bolder, and dared to move freely. My only idea for the moment was to"
"10921",159,"get away from these foul beings, and I scarcely noticed that I had"
"10922",159,"emerged upon a faint pathway amidst the trees. Then suddenly traversing"
"10923",159,"a little glade, I saw with an unpleasant start two clumsy legs among"
"10924",159,"the trees, walking with noiseless footsteps parallel with my course,"
"10925",159,"and perhaps thirty yards away from me. The head and upper part of the"
"10926",159,"body were hidden by a tangle of creeper. I stopped abruptly, hoping the"
"10927",159,"creature did not see me. The feet stopped as I did. So nervous was I"
"10928",159,"that I controlled an impulse to headlong flight with the utmost"
"10929",159,"difficulty. Then looking hard, I distinguished through the interlacing"
"10930",159,"network the head and body of the brute I had seen drinking. He moved"
"10931",159,"his head. There was an emerald flash in his eyes as he glanced at me"
"10932",159,"from the shadow of the trees, a half-luminous colour that vanished as"
"10933",159,"he turned his head again. He was motionless for a moment, and then with"
"10934",159,"a noiseless tread began running through the green confusion. In another"
"10935",159,"moment he had vanished behind some bushes. I could not see him, but I"
"10936",159,"felt that he had stopped and was watching me again."
"10937",159,""
"10938",159,"What on earth was he,—man or beast? What did he want with me? I had no"
"10939",159,"weapon, not even a stick. Flight would be madness. At any rate the"
"10940",159,"Thing, whatever it was, lacked the courage to attack me. Setting my"
"10941",159,"teeth hard, I walked straight towards him. I was anxious not to show"
"10942",159,"the fear that seemed chilling my backbone. I pushed through a tangle of"
"10943",159,"tall white-flowered bushes, and saw him twenty paces beyond, looking"
"10944",159,"over his shoulder at me and hesitating. I advanced a step or two,"
"10945",159,"looking steadfastly into his eyes."
"10946",159,""
"10947",159,"“Who are you?” said I."
"10948",159,""
"10949",159,"He tried to meet my gaze. “No!” he said suddenly, and turning went"
"10950",159,"bounding away from me through the undergrowth. Then he turned and"
"10951",159,"stared at me again. His eyes shone brightly out of the dusk under the"
"10952",159,"trees."
"10953",159,""
"10954",159,"My heart was in my mouth; but I felt my only chance was bluff, and"
"10955",159,"walked steadily towards him. He turned again, and vanished into the"
"10956",159,"dusk. Once more I thought I caught the glint of his eyes, and that was"
"10957",159,"all."
"10958",159,""
"10959",159,"For the first time I realised how the lateness of the hour might affect"
"10960",159,"me. The sun had set some minutes since, the swift dusk of the tropics"
"10961",159,"was already fading out of the eastern sky, and a pioneer moth fluttered"
"10962",159,"silently by my head. Unless I would spend the night among the unknown"
"10963",159,"dangers of the mysterious forest, I must hasten back to the enclosure."
"10964",159,"The thought of a return to that pain-haunted refuge was extremely"
"10965",159,"disagreeable, but still more so was the idea of being overtaken in the"
"10966",159,"open by darkness and all that darkness might conceal. I gave one more"
"10967",159,"look into the blue shadows that had swallowed up this odd creature, and"
"10968",159,"then retraced my way down the slope towards the stream, going as I"
"10969",159,"judged in the direction from which I had come."
"10970",159,""
"10971",159,"I walked eagerly, my mind confused with many things, and presently"
"10972",159,"found myself in a level place among scattered trees. The colourless"
"10973",159,"clearness that comes after the sunset flush was darkling; the blue sky"
"10974",159,"above grew momentarily deeper, and the little stars one by one pierced"
"10975",159,"the attenuated light; the interspaces of the trees, the gaps in the"
"10976",159,"further vegetation, that had been hazy blue in the daylight, grew black"
"10977",159,"and mysterious. I pushed on. The colour vanished from the world. The"
"10978",159,"tree-tops rose against the luminous blue sky in inky silhouette, and"
"10979",159,"all below that outline melted into one formless blackness. Presently"
"10980",159,"the trees grew thinner, and the shrubby undergrowth more abundant. Then"
"10981",159,"there was a desolate space covered with a white sand, and then another"
"10982",159,"expanse of tangled bushes. I did not remember crossing the sand-opening"
"10983",159,"before. I began to be tormented by a faint rustling upon my right hand."
"10984",159,"I thought at first it was fancy, for whenever I stopped there was"
"10985",159,"silence, save for the evening breeze in the tree-tops. Then when I"
"10986",159,"turned to hurry on again there was an echo to my footsteps."
"10987",159,""
"10988",159,"I turned away from the thickets, keeping to the more open ground, and"
"10989",159,"endeavouring by sudden turns now and then to surprise something in the"
"10990",159,"act of creeping upon me. I saw nothing, and nevertheless my sense of"
"10991",159,"another presence grew steadily. I increased my pace, and after some"
"10992",159,"time came to a slight ridge, crossed it, and turned sharply, regarding"
"10993",159,"it steadfastly from the further side. It came out black and clear-cut"
"10994",159,"against the darkling sky; and presently a shapeless lump heaved up"
"10995",159,"momentarily against the sky-line and vanished again. I felt assured now"
"10996",159,"that my tawny-faced antagonist was stalking me once more; and coupled"
"10997",159,"with that was another unpleasant realisation, that I had lost my way."
"10998",159,""
"10999",159,"For a time I hurried on hopelessly perplexed, and pursued by that"
"11000",159,"stealthy approach. Whatever it was, the Thing either lacked the courage"
"11001",159,"to attack me, or it was waiting to take me at some disadvantage. I kept"
"11002",159,"studiously to the open. At times I would turn and listen; and presently"
"11003",159,"I had half persuaded myself that my pursuer had abandoned the chase, or"
"11004",159,"was a mere creation of my disordered imagination. Then I heard the"
"11005",159,"sound of the sea. I quickened my footsteps almost into a run, and"
"11006",159,"immediately there was a stumble in my rear."
"11007",159,""
"11008",159,"I turned suddenly, and stared at the uncertain trees behind me. One"
"11009",159,"black shadow seemed to leap into another. I listened, rigid, and heard"
"11010",159,"nothing but the creep of the blood in my ears. I thought that my nerves"
"11011",159,"were unstrung, and that my imagination was tricking me, and turned"
"11012",159,"resolutely towards the sound of the sea again."
"11013",159,""
"11014",159,"In a minute or so the trees grew thinner, and I emerged upon a bare,"
"11015",159,"low headland running out into the sombre water. The night was calm and"
"11016",159,"clear, and the reflection of the growing multitude of the stars"
"11017",159,"shivered in the tranquil heaving of the sea. Some way out, the wash"
"11018",159,"upon an irregular band of reef shone with a pallid light of its own."
"11019",159,"Westward I saw the zodiacal light mingling with the yellow brilliance"
"11020",159,"of the evening star. The coast fell away from me to the east, and"
"11021",159,"westward it was hidden by the shoulder of the cape. Then I recalled the"
"11022",159,"fact that Moreau’s beach lay to the west."
"11023",159,""
"11024",159,"A twig snapped behind me, and there was a rustle. I turned, and stood"
"11025",159,"facing the dark trees. I could see nothing—or else I could see too"
"11026",159,"much. Every dark form in the dimness had its ominous quality, its"
"11027",159,"peculiar suggestion of alert watchfulness. So I stood for perhaps a"
"11028",159,"minute, and then, with an eye to the trees still, turned westward to"
"11029",159,"cross the headland; and as I moved, one among the lurking shadows moved"
"11030",159,"to follow me."
"11031",159,""
"11032",159,"My heart beat quickly. Presently the broad sweep of a bay to the"
"11033",159,"westward became visible, and I halted again. The noiseless shadow"
"11034",159,"halted a dozen yards from me. A little point of light shone on the"
"11035",159,"further bend of the curve, and the grey sweep of the sandy beach lay"
"11036",159,"faint under the starlight. Perhaps two miles away was that little point"
"11037",159,"of light. To get to the beach I should have to go through the trees"
"11038",159,"where the shadows lurked, and down a bushy slope."
"11039",159,""
"11040",159,"I could see the Thing rather more distinctly now. It was no animal, for"
"11041",159,"it stood erect. At that I opened my mouth to speak, and found a hoarse"
"11042",159,"phlegm choked my voice. I tried again, and shouted, “Who is there?”"
"11043",159,"There was no answer. I advanced a step. The Thing did not move, only"
"11044",159,"gathered itself together. My foot struck a stone. That gave me an idea."
"11045",159,"Without taking my eyes off the black form before me, I stooped and"
"11046",159,"picked up this lump of rock; but at my motion the Thing turned abruptly"
"11047",159,"as a dog might have done, and slunk obliquely into the further"
"11048",159,"darkness. Then I recalled a schoolboy expedient against big dogs, and"
"11049",159,"twisted the rock into my handkerchief, and gave this a turn round my"
"11050",159,"wrist. I heard a movement further off among the shadows, as if the"
"11051",159,"Thing was in retreat. Then suddenly my tense excitement gave way; I"
"11052",159,"broke into a profuse perspiration and fell a-trembling, with my"
"11053",159,"adversary routed and this weapon in my hand."
"11054",159,""
"11055",159,"It was some time before I could summon resolution to go down through"
"11056",159,"the trees and bushes upon the flank of the headland to the beach. At"
"11057",159,"last I did it at a run; and as I emerged from the thicket upon the"
"11058",159,"sand, I heard some other body come crashing after me. At that I"
"11059",159,"completely lost my head with fear, and began running along the sand."
"11060",159,"Forthwith there came the swift patter of soft feet in pursuit. I gave a"
"11061",159,"wild cry, and redoubled my pace. Some dim, black things about three or"
"11062",159,"four times the size of rabbits went running or hopping up from the"
"11063",159,"beach towards the bushes as I passed."
"11064",159,""
"11065",159,"So long as I live, I shall remember the terror of that chase. I ran"
"11066",159,"near the water’s edge, and heard every now and then the splash of the"
"11067",159,"feet that gained upon me. Far away, hopelessly far, was the yellow"
"11068",159,"light. All the night about us was black and still. Splash, splash, came"
"11069",159,"the pursuing feet, nearer and nearer. I felt my breath going, for I was"
"11070",159,"quite out of training; it whooped as I drew it, and I felt a pain like"
"11071",159,"a knife at my side. I perceived the Thing would come up with me long"
"11072",159,"before I reached the enclosure, and, desperate and sobbing for my"
"11073",159,"breath, I wheeled round upon it and struck at it as it came up to"
"11074",159,"me,—struck with all my strength. The stone came out of the sling of the"
"11075",159,"handkerchief as I did so. As I turned, the Thing, which had been"
"11076",159,"running on all-fours, rose to its feet, and the missile fell fair on"
"11077",159,"its left temple. The skull rang loud, and the animal-man blundered into"
"11078",159,"me, thrust me back with its hands, and went staggering past me to fall"
"11079",159,"headlong upon the sand with its face in the water; and there it lay"
"11080",159,"still."
"11081",159,""
"11082",159,"I could not bring myself to approach that black heap. I left it there,"
"11083",159,"with the water rippling round it, under the still stars, and giving it"
"11084",159,"a wide berth pursued my way towards the yellow glow of the house; and"
"11085",159,"presently, with a positive effect of relief, came the pitiful moaning"
"11086",159,"of the puma, the sound that had originally driven me out to explore"
"11087",159,"this mysterious island. At that, though I was faint and horribly"
"11088",159,"fatigued, I gathered together all my strength, and began running again"
"11089",159,"towards the light. I thought I heard a voice calling me."

"11100",159,"side of that orange oblong of light, the voice of Montgomery shouting,"
"11101",159,"“Prendick!” I continued running. Presently I heard him again. I replied"
"11102",159,"by a feeble “Hullo!” and in another moment had staggered up to him."
"11103",159,""
"11104",159,"“Where have you been?” said he, holding me at arm’s length, so that the"
"11105",159,"light from the door fell on my face. “We have both been so busy that we"
"11106",159,"forgot you until about half an hour ago.” He led me into the room and"
"11107",159,"sat me down in the deck chair. For awhile I was blinded by the light."
"11108",159,"“We did not think you would start to explore this island of ours"
"11109",159,"without telling us,” he said; and then, “I was afraid—But—what—Hullo!”"
"11110",159,""
"11111",159,"My last remaining strength slipped from me, and my head fell forward on"
"11112",159,"my chest. I think he found a certain satisfaction in giving me brandy."

"11114",159,"“For God’s sake,” said I, “fasten that door.”"

"11118",159,"He locked the door and turned to me again. He asked me no questions,"
"11119",159,"but gave me some more brandy and water and pressed me to eat. I was in"
"11120",159,"a state of collapse. He said something vague about his forgetting to"
"11121",159,"warn me, and asked me briefly when I left the house and what I had"
"11122",159,"seen."
"11123",159,""
"11124",159,"I answered him as briefly, in fragmentary sentences. “Tell me what it"

"11126",159,""
"11127",159,"“It’s nothing so very dreadful,” said he. “But I think you have had"
"11128",159,"about enough for one day.” The puma suddenly gave a sharp yell of pain."
"11129",159,"At that he swore under his breath. “I’m damned,” said he, “if this"

"11141",159,"He looked me squarely in the eyes, and twisted his mouth askew. His"

"11144",159,""
"11145",159,"I felt a gust of intense irritation, which passed as quickly as it"
"11146",159,"came. I flung myself into the chair again, and pressed my hands on my"
"11147",159,"forehead. The puma began once more."
"11148",159,""
"11149",159,"Montgomery came round behind me and put his hand on my shoulder. “Look"
"11150",159,"here, Prendick,” he said, “I had no business to let you drift out into"

"11158",159,"This he gave me. I took it unresistingly, and he helped me into the"
"11159",159,"hammock."
"11160",159,""
"11161",159,"When I awoke, it was broad day. For a little while I lay flat, staring"
"11162",159,"at the roof above me. The rafters, I observed, were made out of the"
"11163",159,"timbers of a ship. Then I turned my head, and saw a meal prepared for"
"11164",159,"me on the table. I perceived that I was hungry, and prepared to clamber"
"11165",159,"out of the hammock, which, very politely anticipating my intention,"
"11166",159,"twisted round and deposited me upon all-fours on the floor."

"11171",159,"the unglazed window, and that and the food contributed to the sense of"
"11172",159,"animal comfort which I experienced. Presently the door behind me—the"

"11179",159,"the expression of his face the previous night, and with that the memory"
"11180",159,"of all I had experienced reconstructed itself before me. Even as that"
"11181",159,"fear came back to me came a cry from within; but this time it was not"
"11182",159,"the cry of a puma. I put down the mouthful that hesitated upon my lips,"
"11183",159,"and listened. Silence, save for the whisper of the morning breeze. I"
"11184",159,"began to think my ears had deceived me."
"11185",159,""
"11186",159,"After a long pause I resumed my meal, but with my ears still vigilant."
"11187",159,"Presently I heard something else, very faint and low. I sat as if"
"11188",159,"frozen in my attitude. Though it was faint and low, it moved me more"
"11189",159,"profoundly than all that I had hitherto heard of the abominations"
"11190",159,"behind the wall. There was no mistake this time in the quality of the"
"11191",159,"dim, broken sounds; no doubt at all of their source. For it was"
"11192",159,"groaning, broken by sobs and gasps of anguish. It was no brute this"

"11204",159,"the shadow, I saw something bound painfully upon a framework, scarred,"
"11205",159,"red, and bandaged; and then blotting this out appeared the face of old"

"11263",159,"northeastward in a direction at right angles to my previous expedition."
"11264",159,"Once, as I went running headlong up the beach, I glanced over my"
"11265",159,"shoulder and saw his attendant with him. I ran furiously up the slope,"
"11266",159,"over it, then turning eastward along a rocky valley fringed on either"
"11267",159,"side with jungle I ran for perhaps a mile altogether, my chest"
"11268",159,"straining, my heart beating in my ears; and then hearing nothing of"
"11269",159,"Montgomery or his man, and feeling upon the verge of exhaustion, I"
"11270",159,"doubled sharply back towards the beach as I judged, and lay down in the"
"11271",159,"shelter of a canebrake. There I remained for a long time, too fearful"
"11272",159,"to move, and indeed too fearful even to plan a course of action. The"
"11273",159,"wild scene about me lay sleeping silently under the sun, and the only"
"11274",159,"sound near me was the thin hum of some small gnats that had discovered"
"11275",159,"me. Presently I became aware of a drowsy breathing sound, the soughing"
"11276",159,"of the sea upon the beach."
"11277",159,""
"11278",159,"After about an hour I heard Montgomery shouting my name, far away to"
"11279",159,"the north. That set me thinking of my plan of action. As I interpreted"
"11280",159,"it then, this island was inhabited only by these two vivisectors and"
"11281",159,"their animalised victims. Some of these no doubt they could press into"
"11282",159,"their service against me if need arose. I knew both Moreau and"
"11283",159,"Montgomery carried revolvers; and, save for a feeble bar of deal spiked"
"11284",159,"with a small nail, the merest mockery of a mace, I was unarmed."
"11285",159,""
"11286",159,"So I lay still there, until I began to think of food and drink; and at"
"11287",159,"that thought the real hopelessness of my position came home to me. I"
"11288",159,"knew no way of getting anything to eat. I was too ignorant of botany to"
"11289",159,"discover any resort of root or fruit that might lie about me; I had no"
"11290",159,"means of trapping the few rabbits upon the island. It grew blanker the"
"11291",159,"more I turned the prospect over. At last in the desperation of my"
"11292",159,"position, my mind turned to the animal men I had encountered. I tried"
"11293",159,"to find some hope in what I remembered of them. In turn I recalled each"
"11294",159,"one I had seen, and tried to draw some augury of assistance from my"
"11295",159,"memory."
"11296",159,""
"11297",159,"Then suddenly I heard a staghound bay, and at that realised a new"
"11298",159,"danger. I took little time to think, or they would have caught me then,"
"11299",159,"but snatching up my nailed stick, rushed headlong from my hiding-place"
"11300",159,"towards the sound of the sea. I remember a growth of thorny plants,"
"11301",159,"with spines that stabbed like pen-knives. I emerged bleeding and with"
"11302",159,"torn clothes upon the lip of a long creek opening northward. I went"
"11303",159,"straight into the water without a minute’s hesitation, wading up the"
"11304",159,"creek, and presently finding myself kneedeep in a little stream. I"
"11305",159,"scrambled out at last on the westward bank, and with my heart beating"
"11306",159,"loudly in my ears, crept into a tangle of ferns to await the issue. I"
"11307",159,"heard the dog (there was only one) draw nearer, and yelp when it came"
"11308",159,"to the thorns. Then I heard no more, and presently began to think I had"
"11309",159,"escaped."
"11310",159,""
"11311",159,"The minutes passed; the silence lengthened out, and at last after an"
"11312",159,"hour of security my courage began to return to me. By this time I was"
"11313",159,"no longer very much terrified or very miserable. I had, as it were,"
"11314",159,"passed the limit of terror and despair. I felt now that my life was"
"11315",159,"practically lost, and that persuasion made me capable of daring"
"11316",159,"anything. I had even a certain wish to encounter Moreau face to face;"
"11317",159,"and as I had waded into the water, I remembered that if I were too hard"
"11318",159,"pressed at least one path of escape from torment still lay open to"
"11319",159,"me,—they could not very well prevent my drowning myself. I had half a"
"11320",159,"mind to drown myself then; but an odd wish to see the whole adventure"
"11321",159,"out, a queer, impersonal, spectacular interest in myself, restrained"
"11322",159,"me. I stretched my limbs, sore and painful from the pricks of the spiny"
"11323",159,"plants, and stared around me at the trees; and, so suddenly that it"
"11324",159,"seemed to jump out of the green tracery about it, my eyes lit upon a"
"11325",159,"black face watching me. I saw that it was the simian creature who had"
"11326",159,"met the launch upon the beach. He was clinging to the oblique stem of a"
"11327",159,"palm-tree. I gripped my stick, and stood up facing him. He began"
"11328",159,"chattering. “You, you, you,” was all I could distinguish at first."
"11329",159,"Suddenly he dropped from the tree, and in another moment was holding"
"11330",159,"the fronds apart and staring curiously at me."
"11331",159,""
"11332",159,"I did not feel the same repugnance towards this creature which I had"
"11333",159,"experienced in my encounters with the other Beast Men. “You,” he said,"
"11334",159,"“in the boat.” He was a man, then,—at least as much of a man as"
"11335",159,"Montgomery’s attendant,—for he could talk."
"11336",159,""
"11337",159,"“Yes,” I said, “I came in the boat. From the ship.”"
"11338",159,""
"11339",159,"“Oh!” he said, and his bright, restless eyes travelled over me, to my"
"11340",159,"hands, to the stick I carried, to my feet, to the tattered places in my"
"11341",159,"coat, and the cuts and scratches I had received from the thorns. He"
"11342",159,"seemed puzzled at something. His eyes came back to my hands. He held"
"11343",159,"his own hand out and counted his digits slowly, “One, two, three, four,"
"11344",159,"five—eigh?”"
"11345",159,""
"11346",159,"I did not grasp his meaning then; afterwards I was to find that a great"
"11347",159,"proportion of these Beast People had malformed hands, lacking sometimes"
"11348",159,"even three digits. But guessing this was in some way a greeting, I did"
"11349",159,"the same thing by way of reply. He grinned with immense satisfaction."
"11350",159,"Then his swift roving glance went round again; he made a swift"
"11351",159,"movement—and vanished. The fern fronds he had stood between came"
"11352",159,"swishing together."
"11353",159,""
"11354",159,"I pushed out of the brake after him, and was astonished to find him"
"11355",159,"swinging cheerfully by one lank arm from a rope of creepers that looped"
"11356",159,"down from the foliage overhead. His back was to me."
"11357",159,""
"11358",159,"“Hullo!” said I."
"11359",159,""
"11360",159,"He came down with a twisting jump, and stood facing me."
"11361",159,""
"11362",159,"“I say,” said I, “where can I get something to eat?”"
"11363",159,""
"11364",159,"“Eat!” he said. “Eat Man’s food, now.” And his eye went back to the"
"11365",159,"swing of ropes. “At the huts.”"
"11366",159,""
"11367",159,"“But where are the huts?”"
"11368",159,""
"11369",159,"“Oh!”"
"11370",159,""
"11371",159,"“I’m new, you know.”"
"11372",159,""
"11373",159,"At that he swung round, and set off at a quick walk. All his motions"
"11374",159,"were curiously rapid. “Come along,” said he."
"11375",159,""
"11376",159,"I went with him to see the adventure out. I guessed the huts were some"
"11377",159,"rough shelter where he and some more of these Beast People lived. I"
"11378",159,"might perhaps find them friendly, find some handle in their minds to"
"11379",159,"take hold of. I did not know how far they had forgotten their human"
"11380",159,"heritage."
"11381",159,""
"11382",159,"My ape-like companion trotted along by my side, with his hands hanging"
"11383",159,"down and his jaw thrust forward. I wondered what memory he might have"
"11384",159,"in him. “How long have you been on this island?” said I."
"11385",159,""
"11386",159,"“How long?” he asked; and after having the question repeated, he held"
"11387",159,"up three fingers."
"11388",159,""
"11389",159,"The creature was little better than an idiot. I tried to make out what"
"11390",159,"he meant by that, and it seems I bored him. After another question or"
"11391",159,"two he suddenly left my side and went leaping at some fruit that hung"
"11392",159,"from a tree. He pulled down a handful of prickly husks and went on"
"11393",159,"eating the contents. I noted this with satisfaction, for here at least"
"11394",159,"was a hint for feeding. I tried him with some other questions, but his"
"11395",159,"chattering, prompt responses were as often as not quite at cross"
"11396",159,"purposes with my question. Some few were appropriate, others quite"
"11397",159,"parrot-like."
"11398",159,""
"11399",159,"I was so intent upon these peculiarities that I scarcely noticed the"
"11400",159,"path we followed. Presently we came to trees, all charred and brown,"
"11401",159,"and so to a bare place covered with a yellow-white incrustation, across"
"11402",159,"which a drifting smoke, pungent in whiffs to nose and eyes, went"
"11403",159,"drifting. On our right, over a shoulder of bare rock, I saw the level"
"11404",159,"blue of the sea. The path coiled down abruptly into a narrow ravine"
"11405",159,"between two tumbled and knotty masses of blackish scoriae. Into this we"
"11406",159,"plunged."
"11407",159,""
"11408",159,"It was extremely dark, this passage, after the blinding sunlight"
"11409",159,"reflected from the sulphurous ground. Its walls grew steep, and"
"11410",159,"approached each other. Blotches of green and crimson drifted across my"
"11411",159,"eyes. My conductor stopped suddenly. “Home!” said he, and I stood in a"
"11412",159,"floor of a chasm that was at first absolutely dark to me. I heard some"
"11413",159,"strange noises, and thrust the knuckles of my left hand into my eyes. I"
"11414",159,"became aware of a disagreeable odor, like that of a monkey’s cage"
"11415",159,"ill-cleaned. Beyond, the rock opened again upon a gradual slope of"
"11416",159,"sunlit greenery, and on either hand the light smote down through narrow"
"11417",159,"ways into the central gloom."

"11425",159,""
"11426",159,"Then something cold touched my hand. I started violently, and saw close"
"11427",159,"to me a dim pinkish thing, looking more like a flayed child than"
"11428",159,"anything else in the world. The creature had exactly the mild but"
"11429",159,"repulsive features of a sloth, the same low forehead and slow gestures."
"11430",159,""
"11431",159,"As the first shock of the change of light passed, I saw about me more"
"11432",159,"distinctly. The little sloth-like creature was standing and staring at"
"11433",159,"me. My conductor had vanished. The place was a narrow passage between"
"11434",159,"high walls of lava, a crack in the knotted rock, and on either side"
"11435",159,"interwoven heaps of sea-mat, palm-fans, and reeds leaning against the"
"11436",159,"rock formed rough and impenetrably dark dens. The winding way up the"
"11437",159,"ravine between these was scarcely three yards wide, and was disfigured"
"11438",159,"by lumps of decaying fruit-pulp and other refuse, which accounted for"
"11439",159,"the disagreeable stench of the place."
"11440",159,""
"11441",159,"The little pink sloth-creature was still blinking at me when my Ape-man"
"11442",159,"reappeared at the aperture of the nearest of these dens, and beckoned"
"11443",159,"me in. As he did so a slouching monster wriggled out of one of the"
"11444",159,"places, further up this strange street, and stood up in featureless"
"11445",159,"silhouette against the bright green beyond, staring at me. I hesitated,"
"11446",159,"having half a mind to bolt the way I had come; and then, determined to"
"11447",159,"go through with the adventure, I gripped my nailed stick about the"
"11448",159,"middle and crawled into the little evil-smelling lean-to after my"
"11449",159,"conductor."
"11450",159,""
"11451",159,"It was a semi-circular space, shaped like the half of a bee-hive; and"
"11452",159,"against the rocky wall that formed the inner side of it was a pile of"
"11453",159,"variegated fruits, cocoa-nuts among others. Some rough vessels of lava"
"11454",159,"and wood stood about the floor, and one on a rough stool. There was no"
"11455",159,"fire. In the darkest corner of the hut sat a shapeless mass of darkness"
"11456",159,"that grunted “Hey!” as I came in, and my Ape-man stood in the dim light"
"11457",159,"of the doorway and held out a split cocoa-nut to me as I crawled into"
"11458",159,"the other corner and squatted down. I took it, and began gnawing it, as"
"11459",159,"serenely as possible, in spite of a certain trepidation and the nearly"
"11460",159,"intolerable closeness of the den. The little pink sloth-creature stood"
"11461",159,"in the aperture of the hut, and something else with a drab face and"
"11462",159,"bright eyes came staring over its shoulder."

"11467",159,"me.”"

"11469",159,"“Shut up!” said the voice from the dark, and grunted. I gnawed my"
"11470",159,"cocoa-nut amid an impressive stillness."
"11471",159,""
"11472",159,"I peered hard into the blackness, but could distinguish nothing."

"11474",159,"“It is a man,” the voice repeated. “He comes to live with us?”"
"11475",159,""

"11485",159,"I began to distinguish now a deeper blackness in the black, a vague"
"11486",159,"outline of a hunched-up figure. Then I noticed the opening of the place"

"11501",159,"they swayed from side to side in the oddest way, and beat their hands"

"11639",159,"under the trees beyond the end of the passage of dens the dark figure"
"11640",159,"and awful white face of Moreau. He was holding the leaping staghound"

"11654",159,"into another. I felt his hands fly round, clutching at me and missing"
"11655",159,"me. The little pink sloth-creature dashed at me, and I gashed down its"
"11656",159,"ugly face with the nail in my stick and in another minute was"
"11657",159,"scrambling up a steep side pathway, a kind of sloping chimney, out of"
"11658",159,"the ravine. I heard a howl behind me, and cries of “Catch him!” “Hold"
"11659",159,"him!” and the grey-faced creature appeared behind me and jammed his"
"11660",159,"huge bulk into the cleft. “Go on! go on!” they howled. I clambered up"

"11664",159,"That gap was altogether fortunate for me, for the narrow chimney,"

"11666",159,"over the white space and down a steep slope, through a scattered growth"
"11667",159,"of trees, and came to a low-lying stretch of tall reeds, through which"
"11668",159,"I pushed into a dark, thick undergrowth that was black and succulent"
"11669",159,"under foot. As I plunged into the reeds, my foremost pursuers emerged"
"11670",159,"from the gap. I broke my way through this undergrowth for some minutes."

"11673",159,"crashing of the reeds, and every now and then the crackling crash of a"
"11674",159,"branch. Some of the creatures roared like excited beasts of prey. The"
"11675",159,"staghound yelped to the left. I heard Moreau and Montgomery shouting in"
"11676",159,"the same direction. I turned sharply to the right. It seemed to me even"
"11677",159,"then that I heard Montgomery shouting for me to run for my life."
"11678",159,""
"11679",159,"Presently the ground gave rich and oozy under my feet; but I was"
"11680",159,"desperate and went headlong into it, struggled through kneedeep, and so"
"11681",159,"came to a winding path among tall canes. The noise of my pursuers"
"11682",159,"passed away to my left. In one place three strange, pink, hopping"
"11683",159,"animals, about the size of cats, bolted before my footsteps. This"
"11684",159,"pathway ran up hill, across another open space covered with white"
"11685",159,"incrustation, and plunged into a canebrake again. Then suddenly it"
"11686",159,"turned parallel with the edge of a steep-walled gap, which came without"
"11687",159,"warning, like the ha-ha of an English park,—turned with an unexpected"
"11688",159,"abruptness. I was still running with all my might, and I never saw this"
"11689",159,"drop until I was flying headlong through the air."
"11690",159,""
"11691",159,"I fell on my forearms and head, among thorns, and rose with a torn ear"
"11692",159,"and bleeding face. I had fallen into a precipitous ravine, rocky and"
"11693",159,"thorny, full of a hazy mist which drifted about me in wisps, and with a"
"11694",159,"narrow streamlet from which this mist came meandering down the centre."
"11695",159,"I was astonished at this thin fog in the full blaze of daylight; but I"
"11696",159,"had no time to stand wondering then. I turned to my right, down-stream,"
"11697",159,"hoping to come to the sea in that direction, and so have my way open to"
"11698",159,"drown myself. It was only later I found that I had dropped my nailed"
"11699",159,"stick in my fall."
"11700",159,""
"11701",159,"Presently the ravine grew narrower for a space, and carelessly I"
"11702",159,"stepped into the stream. I jumped out again pretty quickly, for the"
"11703",159,"water was almost boiling. I noticed too there was a thin sulphurous"
"11704",159,"scum drifting upon its coiling water. Almost immediately came a turn in"
"11705",159,"the ravine, and the indistinct blue horizon. The nearer sea was"
"11706",159,"flashing the sun from a myriad facets. I saw my death before me; but I"
"11707",159,"was hot and panting, with the warm blood oozing out on my face and"
"11708",159,"running pleasantly through my veins. I felt more than a touch of"
"11709",159,"exultation too, at having distanced my pursuers. It was not in me then"
"11710",159,"to go out and drown myself yet. I stared back the way I had come."
"11711",159,""
"11712",159,"I listened. Save for the hum of the gnats and the chirp of some small"
"11713",159,"insects that hopped among the thorns, the air was absolutely still."
"11714",159,"Then came the yelp of a dog, very faint, and a chattering and"
"11715",159,"gibbering, the snap of a whip, and voices. They grew louder, then"
"11716",159,"fainter again. The noise receded up the stream and faded away. For a"
"11717",159,"while the chase was over; but I knew now how much hope of help for me"
"11718",159,"lay in the Beast People."

"11728",159,"broadened out to a shallow, weedy sand, in which an abundance of crabs"
"11729",159,"and long-bodied, many-legged creatures started from my footfall. I"
"11730",159,"walked to the very edge of the salt water, and then I felt I was safe."
"11731",159,"I turned and stared, arms akimbo, at the thick green behind me, into"
"11732",159,"which the steamy ravine cut like a smoking gash. But, as I say, I was"
"11733",159,"too full of excitement and (a true saying, though those who have never"
"11734",159,"known danger may doubt it) too desperate to die."
"11735",159,""
"11736",159,"Then it came into my head that there was one chance before me yet."

"11739",159,"enclosure,—make a flank march upon them, in fact, and then with a rock"
"11740",159,"lugged out of their loosely-built wall, perhaps, smash in the lock of"
"11741",159,"the smaller door and see what I could find (knife, pistol, or what not)"
"11742",159,"to fight them with when they returned? It was at any rate something to"
"11743",159,"try."
"11744",159,""
"11745",159,"So I turned to the westward and walked along by the water’s edge. The"
"11746",159,"setting sun flashed his blinding heat into my eyes. The slight Pacific"
"11747",159,"tide was running in with a gentle ripple. Presently the shore fell away"
"11748",159,"southward, and the sun came round upon my right hand. Then suddenly,"
"11749",159,"far in front of me, I saw first one and then several figures emerging"
"11750",159,"from the bushes,—Moreau, with his grey staghound, then Montgomery, and"
"11751",159,"two others. At that I stopped."
"11752",159,""
"11753",159,"They saw me, and began gesticulating and advancing. I stood watching"
"11754",159,"them approach. The two Beast Men came running forward to cut me off"
"11755",159,"from the undergrowth, inland. Montgomery came, running also, but"
"11756",159,"straight towards me. Moreau followed slower with the dog."
"11757",159,""
"11758",159,"At last I roused myself from my inaction, and turning seaward walked"
"11759",159,"straight into the water. The water was very shallow at first. I was"
"11760",159,"thirty yards out before the waves reached to my waist. Dimly I could"
"11761",159,"see the intertidal creatures darting away from my feet."

"11763",159,"“What are you doing, man?” cried Montgomery."
"11764",159,""
"11765",159,"I turned, standing waist deep, and stared at them. Montgomery stood"
"11766",159,"panting at the margin of the water. His face was bright-red with"
"11767",159,"exertion, his long flaxen hair blown about his head, and his dropping"
"11768",159,"nether lip showed his irregular teeth. Moreau was just coming up, his"
"11769",159,"face pale and firm, and the dog at his hand barked at me. Both men had"
"11770",159,"heavy whips. Farther up the beach stared the Beast Men."
"11771",159,""
"11772",159,"“What am I doing? I am going to drown myself,” said I."

"11774",159,"Montgomery and Moreau looked at each other. “Why?” asked Moreau."

"11776",159,"“Because that is better than being tortured by you.”"
"11777",159,""
"11778",159,"“I told you so,” said Montgomery, and Moreau said something in a low"

"11790",159,"I looked past my interlocutors. Up the beach were M’ling, Montgomery’s"

"11794",159,""
"11795",159,"“Who are these creatures?” said I, pointing to them and raising my"

"11818",159,"arrival, come out from among the trees, and others followed him, to"

"11959",159,"things than that. There is building up as well as breaking down and"
"11960",159,"changing. You have heard, perhaps, of a common surgical operation"
"11961",159,"resorted to in cases where the nose has been destroyed: a flap of skin"
"11962",159,"is cut from the forehead, turned down on the nose, and heals in the new"
"11963",159,"position. This is a kind of grafting in a new position of part of an"
"11964",159,"animal upon itself. Grafting of freshly obtained material from another"
"11965",159,"animal is also possible,—the case of teeth, for example. The grafting"
"11966",159,"of skin and bone is done to facilitate healing: the surgeon places in"
"11967",159,"the middle of the wound pieces of skin snipped from another animal, or"
"11968",159,"fragments of bone from a victim freshly killed. Hunter’s"
"11969",159,"cock-spur—possibly you have heard of that—flourished on the bull’s"
"11970",159,"neck; and the rhinoceros rats of the Algerian zouaves are also to be"
"11971",159,"thought of,—monsters manufactured by transferring a slip from the tail"
"11972",159,"of an ordinary rat to its snout, and allowing it to heal in that"

"11977",159,"“Yes. These creatures you have seen are animals carven and wrought into"
"11978",159,"new shapes. To that, to the study of the plasticity of living forms, my"

"11980",159,"as I go. I see you look horrified, and yet I am telling you nothing"

"11982",159,"one had the temerity to touch it. It is not simply the outward form of"
"11983",159,"an animal which I can change. The physiology, the chemical rhythm of"
"11984",159,"the creature, may also be made to undergo an enduring modification,—of"
"11985",159,"which vaccination and other methods of inoculation with living or dead"
"11986",159,"matter are examples that will, no doubt, be familiar to you. A similar"
"11987",159,"operation is the transfusion of blood,—with which subject, indeed, I"

"11992",159,"mountebank or contortionist. Victor Hugo gives an account of them in"
"11993",159,"‘L’Homme qui Rit.’—But perhaps my meaning grows plain now. You begin to"

"12224",159,"the subtle grafting and reshaping one must needs do to the brain that"
"12225",159,"my trouble lies. The intelligence is often oddly low, with"
"12226",159,"unaccountable blank ends, unexpected gaps. And least satisfactory of"

"12229",159,"harm humanity, a strange hidden reservoir to burst forth suddenly and"
"12230",159,"inundate the whole being of the creature with anger, hate, or fear."
"12231",159,"These creatures of mine seemed strange and uncanny to you so soon as"
"12232",159,"you began to observe them; but to me, just after I make them, they seem"
"12233",159,"to be indisputably human beings. It’s afterwards, as I observe them,"
"12234",159,"that the persuasion fades. First one animal trait, then another, creeps"
"12235",159,"to the surface and stares out at me. But I will conquer yet! Each time"

"12249",159,"for he interferes in their affairs. He has trained one or two of them"
"12250",159,"to our service. He’s ashamed of it, but I believe he half likes some of"

"12310",159,"The puma was resting to heal that day; but Moreau, who was singularly"
"12311",159,"solitary in his habits, did not join us. I talked with Montgomery to"

"12313",159,"I was urgent to know how these inhuman monsters were kept from falling"

"12315",159,"to me that the comparative safety of Moreau and himself was due to the"

"12317",159,"intelligence and the tendency of their animal instincts to reawaken,"
"12318",159,"they had certain fixed ideas implanted by Moreau in their minds, which"
"12319",159,"absolutely bounded their imaginations. They were really hypnotised; had"
"12320",159,"been told that certain things were impossible, and that certain things"
"12321",159,"were not to be done, and these prohibitions were woven into the texture"
"12322",159,"of their minds beyond any possibility of disobedience or dispute."

"12324",159,"Certain matters, however, in which old instinct was at war with"

"12327",159,"in their minds with the deep-seated, ever-rebellious cravings of their"
"12328",159,"animal natures. This Law they were ever repeating, I found, and ever"
"12329",159,"breaking. Both Montgomery and Moreau displayed particular solicitude to"
"12330",159,"keep them ignorant of the taste of blood; they feared the inevitable"
"12331",159,"suggestions of that flavour. Montgomery told me that the Law,"
"12332",159,"especially among the feline Beast People, became oddly weakened about"
"12333",159,"nightfall; that then the animal was at its strongest; that a spirit of"
"12334",159,"adventure sprang up in them at the dusk, when they would dare things"
"12335",159,"they never seemed to dream about by day. To that I owed my stalking by"
"12336",159,"the Leopard-man, on the night of my arrival. But during these earlier"
"12337",159,"days of my stay they broke the Law only furtively and after dark; in"

"12340",159,""
"12341",159,"And here perhaps I may give a few general facts about the island and"
"12342",159,"the Beast People. The island, which was of irregular outline and lay"
"12343",159,"low upon the wide sea, had a total area, I suppose, of seven or eight"
"12344",159,"square miles.[2] It was volcanic in origin, and was now fringed on"
"12345",159,"three sides by coral reefs; some fumaroles to the northward, and a hot"
"12346",159,"spring, were the only vestiges of the forces that had long since"
"12347",159,"originated it. Now and then a faint quiver of earthquake would be"
"12348",159,"sensible, and sometimes the ascent of the spire of smoke would be"
"12349",159,"rendered tumultuous by gusts of steam; but that was all. The population"
"12350",159,"of the island, Montgomery informed me, now numbered rather more than"
"12351",159,"sixty of these strange creations of Moreau’s art, not counting the"
"12352",159,"smaller monstrosities which lived in the undergrowth and were without"
"12353",159,"human form. Altogether he had made nearly a hundred and twenty; but"
"12354",159,"many had died, and others—like the writhing Footless Thing of which he"
"12355",159,"had told me—had come by violent ends. In answer to my question,"
"12356",159,"Montgomery said that they actually bore offspring, but that these"
"12357",159,"generally died. When they lived, Moreau took them and stamped the human"
"12358",159,"form upon them. There was no evidence of the inheritance of their"
"12359",159,"acquired human characteristics. The females were less numerous than the"
"12360",159,"males, and liable to much furtive persecution in spite of the monogamy"

"12374",159,"forward carriage of the head and the clumsy and inhuman curvature of"
"12375",159,"the spine. Even the Ape-man lacked that inward sinuous curve of the"
"12376",159,"back which makes the human figure so graceful. Most had their shoulders"

"12384",159,"strangely-placed eyes. None could laugh, though the Ape-man had a"

"12531",159,"“Come along, Prendick,” said Montgomery, taking my arm; and I went on"
"12532",159,"with him."
"12533",159,""
"12534",159,"The Satyr and the Ape-man stood watching us and making other remarks to"
"12535",159,"each other."
"12536",159,""
"12537",159,"“He says nothing,” said the Satyr. “Men have voices.”"
"12538",159,""
"12539",159,"“Yesterday he asked me of things to eat,” said the Ape-man. “He did not"
"12540",159,"know.”"
"12541",159,""
"12542",159,"Then they spoke inaudible things, and I heard the Satyr laughing."
"12543",159,""
"12544",159,"It was on our way back that we came upon the dead rabbit. The red body"
"12545",159,"of the wretched little beast was rent to pieces, many of the ribs"
"12546",159,"stripped white, and the backbone indisputably gnawed."
"12547",159,""
"12548",159,"At that Montgomery stopped. “Good God!” said he, stooping down, and"
"12549",159,"picking up some of the crushed vertebrae to examine them more closely."
"12550",159,"“Good God!” he repeated, “what can this mean?”"
"12551",159,""
"12552",159,"“Some carnivore of yours has remembered its old habits,” I said after a"
"12553",159,"pause. “This backbone has been bitten through.”"
"12554",159,""
"12555",159,"He stood staring, with his face white and his lip pulled askew. “I"
"12556",159,"don’t like this,” he said slowly."
"12557",159,""
"12558",159,"“I saw something of the same kind,” said I, “the first day I came"
"12559",159,"here.”"
"12560",159,""
"12561",159,"“The devil you did! What was it?”"
"12562",159,""
"12563",159,"“A rabbit with its head twisted off.”"
"12564",159,""
"12565",159,"“The day you came here?”"
"12566",159,""
"12567",159,"“The day I came here. In the undergrowth at the back of the enclosure,"
"12568",159,"when I went out in the evening. The head was completely wrung off.”"
"12569",159,""
"12570",159,"He gave a long, low whistle."
"12571",159,""
"12572",159,"“And what is more, I have an idea which of your brutes did the thing."
"12573",159,"It’s only a suspicion, you know. Before I came on the rabbit I saw one"
"12574",159,"of your monsters drinking in the stream.”"
"12575",159,""
"12576",159,"“Sucking his drink?”"
"12577",159,""
"12578",159,"“Yes.”"
"12579",159,""
"12580",159,"“‘Not to suck your drink; that is the Law.’ Much the brutes care for"
"12581",159,"the Law, eh? when Moreau’s not about!”"
"12582",159,""
"12583",159,"“It was the brute who chased me.”"
"12584",159,""
"12585",159,"“Of course,” said Montgomery; “it’s just the way with carnivores. After"
"12586",159,"a kill, they drink. It’s the taste of blood, you know.—What was the"
"12587",159,"brute like?” he continued. “Would you know him again?” He glanced about"
"12588",159,"us, standing astride over the mess of dead rabbit, his eyes roving"
"12589",159,"among the shadows and screens of greenery, the lurking-places and"
"12590",159,"ambuscades of the forest that bounded us in. “The taste of blood,” he"
"12591",159,"said again."
"12592",159,""
"12593",159,"He took out his revolver, examined the cartridges in it and replaced"
"12594",159,"it. Then he began to pull at his dropping lip."
"12595",159,""
"12596",159,"“I think I should know the brute again,” I said. “I stunned him. He"
"12597",159,"ought to have a handsome bruise on the forehead of him.”"
"12598",159,""
"12599",159,"“But then we have to _prove_ that he killed the rabbit,” said"
"12600",159,"Montgomery. “I wish I’d never brought the things here.”"
"12601",159,""
"12602",159,"I should have gone on, but he stayed there thinking over the mangled"
"12603",159,"rabbit in a puzzle-headed way. As it was, I went to such a distance"
"12604",159,"that the rabbit’s remains were hidden."
"12605",159,""
"12606",159,"“Come on!” I said."
"12607",159,""
"12608",159,"Presently he woke up and came towards me. “You see,” he said, almost in"
"12609",159,"a whisper, “they are all supposed to have a fixed idea against eating"
"12610",159,"anything that runs on land. If some brute has by any accident tasted"
"12611",159,"blood—”"
"12612",159,""
"12613",159,"We went on some way in silence. “I wonder what can have happened,” he"
"12614",159,"said to himself. Then, after a pause again: “I did a foolish thing the"
"12615",159,"other day. That servant of mine—I showed him how to skin and cook a"
"12616",159,"rabbit. It’s odd—I saw him licking his hands—It never occurred to me.”"
"12617",159,""
"12618",159,"Then: “We must put a stop to this. I must tell Moreau.”"
"12619",159,""
"12620",159,"He could think of nothing else on our homeward journey."
"12621",159,""
"12622",159,"Moreau took the matter even more seriously than Montgomery, and I need"
"12623",159,"scarcely say that I was affected by their evident consternation."
"12624",159,""
"12625",159,"“We must make an example,” said Moreau. “I’ve no doubt in my own mind"
"12626",159,"that the Leopard-man was the sinner. But how can we prove it? I wish,"
"12627",159,"Montgomery, you had kept your taste for meat in hand, and gone without"
"12628",159,"these exciting novelties. We may find ourselves in a mess yet, through"
"12629",159,"it.”"
"12630",159,""
"12631",159,"“I was a silly ass,” said Montgomery. “But the thing’s done now; and"
"12632",159,"you said I might have them, you know.”"
"12633",159,""
"12634",159,"“We must see to the thing at once,” said Moreau. “I suppose if anything"
"12635",159,"should turn up, M’ling can take care of himself?”"
"12636",159,""
"12637",159,"“I’m not so sure of M’ling,” said Montgomery. “I think I ought to know"
"12638",159,"him.”"
"12639",159,""
"12640",159,"In the afternoon, Moreau, Montgomery, myself, and M’ling went across"
"12641",159,"the island to the huts in the ravine. We three were armed; M’ling"
"12642",159,"carried the little hatchet he used in chopping firewood, and some coils"
"12643",159,"of wire. Moreau had a huge cowherd’s horn slung over his shoulder."
"12644",159,""
"12645",159,"“You will see a gathering of the Beast People,” said Montgomery. “It is"
"12646",159,"a pretty sight!”"
"12647",159,""
"12648",159,"Moreau said not a word on the way, but the expression of his heavy,"
"12649",159,"white-fringed face was grimly set."
"12650",159,""
"12651",159,"We crossed the ravine down which smoked the stream of hot water, and"
"12652",159,"followed the winding pathway through the canebrakes until we reached a"
"12653",159,"wide area covered over with a thick, powdery yellow substance which I"
"12654",159,"believe was sulphur. Above the shoulder of a weedy bank the sea"
"12655",159,"glittered. We came to a kind of shallow natural amphitheatre, and here"
"12656",159,"the four of us halted. Then Moreau sounded the horn, and broke the"
"12657",159,"sleeping stillness of the tropical afternoon. He must have had strong"
"12658",159,"lungs. The hooting note rose and rose amidst its echoes, to at last an"
"12659",159,"ear-penetrating intensity."
"12660",159,""
"12661",159,"“Ah!” said Moreau, letting the curved instrument fall to his side"
"12662",159,"again."
"12663",159,""
"12664",159,"Immediately there was a crashing through the yellow canes, and a sound"
"12665",159,"of voices from the dense green jungle that marked the morass through"
"12666",159,"which I had run on the previous day. Then at three or four points on"
"12667",159,"the edge of the sulphurous area appeared the grotesque forms of the"
"12668",159,"Beast People hurrying towards us. I could not help a creeping horror,"
"12669",159,"as I perceived first one and then another trot out from the trees or"
"12670",159,"reeds and come shambling along over the hot dust. But Moreau and"
"12671",159,"Montgomery stood calmly enough; and, perforce, I stuck beside them."
"12672",159,""
"12673",159,"First to arrive was the Satyr, strangely unreal for all that he cast a"
"12674",159,"shadow and tossed the dust with his hoofs. After him from the brake"
"12675",159,"came a monstrous lout, a thing of horse and rhinoceros, chewing a straw"
"12676",159,"as it came; then appeared the Swine-woman and two Wolf-women; then the"
"12677",159,"Fox-bear witch, with her red eyes in her peaked red face, and then"
"12678",159,"others,—all hurrying eagerly. As they came forward they began to cringe"
"12679",159,"towards Moreau and chant, quite regardless of one another, fragments of"
"12680",159,"the latter half of the litany of the Law,—“His is the Hand that wounds;"
"12681",159,"His is the Hand that heals,” and so forth. As soon as they had"
"12682",159,"approached within a distance of perhaps thirty yards they halted, and"
"12683",159,"bowing on knees and elbows began flinging the white dust upon their"
"12684",159,"heads."
"12685",159,""
"12686",159,"Imagine the scene if you can! We three blue-clad men, with our"
"12687",159,"misshapen black-faced attendant, standing in a wide expanse of sunlit"
"12688",159,"yellow dust under the blazing blue sky, and surrounded by this circle"
"12689",159,"of crouching and gesticulating monstrosities,—some almost human save in"
"12690",159,"their subtle expression and gestures, some like cripples, some so"
"12691",159,"strangely distorted as to resemble nothing but the denizens of our"
"12692",159,"wildest dreams; and, beyond, the reedy lines of a canebrake in one"
"12693",159,"direction, a dense tangle of palm-trees on the other, separating us"
"12694",159,"from the ravine with the huts, and to the north the hazy horizon of the"
"12695",159,"Pacific Ocean."
"12696",159,""
"12697",159,"“Sixty-two, sixty-three,” counted Moreau. “There are four more.”"
"12698",159,""
"12699",159,"“I do not see the Leopard-man,” said I."
"12700",159,""
"12701",159,"Presently Moreau sounded the great horn again, and at the sound of it"
"12702",159,"all the Beast People writhed and grovelled in the dust. Then, slinking"
"12703",159,"out of the canebrake, stooping near the ground and trying to join the"
"12704",159,"dust-throwing circle behind Moreau’s back, came the Leopard-man. The"
"12705",159,"last of the Beast People to arrive was the little Ape-man. The earlier"
"12706",159,"animals, hot and weary with their grovelling, shot vicious glances at"
"12707",159,"him."
"12708",159,""
"12709",159,"“Cease!” said Moreau, in his firm, loud voice; and the Beast People sat"
"12710",159,"back upon their hams and rested from their worshipping."
"12711",159,""
"12712",159,"“Where is the Sayer of the Law?” said Moreau, and the hairy-grey"
"12713",159,"monster bowed his face in the dust."
"12714",159,""
"12715",159,"“Say the words!” said Moreau."
"12716",159,""
"12717",159,"Forthwith all in the kneeling assembly, swaying from side to side and"
"12718",159,"dashing up the sulphur with their hands,—first the right hand and a"
"12719",159,"puff of dust, and then the left,—began once more to chant their strange"
"12720",159,"litany. When they reached, “Not to eat Flesh or Fish, that is the Law,”"
"12721",159,"Moreau held up his lank white hand."
"12722",159,""
"12723",159,"“Stop!” he cried, and there fell absolute silence upon them all."
"12724",159,""
"12725",159,"I think they all knew and dreaded what was coming. I looked round at"
"12726",159,"their strange faces. When I saw their wincing attitudes and the furtive"
"12727",159,"dread in their bright eyes, I wondered that I had ever believed them to"
"12728",159,"be men."
"12729",159,""
"12730",159,"“That Law has been broken!” said Moreau."
"12731",159,""
"12732",159,"“None escape,” from the faceless creature with the silvery hair. “None"
"12733",159,"escape,” repeated the kneeling circle of Beast People."
"12734",159,""
"12735",159,"“Who is he?” cried Moreau, and looked round at their faces, cracking"
"12736",159,"his whip. I fancied the Hyena-swine looked dejected, so too did the"
"12737",159,"Leopard-man. Moreau stopped, facing this creature, who cringed towards"
"12738",159,"him with the memory and dread of infinite torment."
"12739",159,""
"12740",159,"“Who is he?” repeated Moreau, in a voice of thunder."
"12741",159,""
"12742",159,"“Evil is he who breaks the Law,” chanted the Sayer of the Law."
"12743",159,""
"12744",159,"Moreau looked into the eyes of the Leopard-man, and seemed to be"
"12745",159,"dragging the very soul out of the creature."
"12746",159,""
"12747",159,"“Who breaks the Law—” said Moreau, taking his eyes off his victim, and"
"12748",159,"turning towards us (it seemed to me there was a touch of exultation in"
"12749",159,"his voice)."
"12750",159,""
"12751",159,"“Goes back to the House of Pain,” they all clamoured,—“goes back to the"
"12752",159,"House of Pain, O Master!”"
"12753",159,""
"12754",159,"“Back to the House of Pain,—back to the House of Pain,” gabbled the"
"12755",159,"Ape-man, as though the idea was sweet to him."
"12756",159,""
"12757",159,"“Do you hear?” said Moreau, turning back to the criminal, “my"
"12758",159,"friend—Hullo!”"
"12759",159,""
"12760",159,"For the Leopard-man, released from Moreau’s eye, had risen straight"
"12761",159,"from his knees, and now, with eyes aflame and his huge feline tusks"
"12762",159,"flashing out from under his curling lips, leapt towards his tormentor."
"12763",159,"I am convinced that only the madness of unendurable fear could have"
"12764",159,"prompted this attack. The whole circle of threescore monsters seemed to"
"12765",159,"rise about us. I drew my revolver. The two figures collided. I saw"
"12766",159,"Moreau reeling back from the Leopard-man’s blow. There was a furious"
"12767",159,"yelling and howling all about us. Every one was moving rapidly. For a"
"12768",159,"moment I thought it was a general revolt. The furious face of the"
"12769",159,"Leopard-man flashed by mine, with M’ling close in pursuit. I saw the"
"12770",159,"yellow eyes of the Hyena-swine blazing with excitement, his attitude as"
"12771",159,"if he were half resolved to attack me. The Satyr, too, glared at me"
"12772",159,"over the Hyena-swine’s hunched shoulders. I heard the crack of Moreau’s"
"12773",159,"pistol, and saw the pink flash dart across the tumult. The whole crowd"
"12774",159,"seemed to swing round in the direction of the glint of fire, and I too"
"12775",159,"was swung round by the magnetism of the movement. In another second I"
"12776",159,"was running, one of a tumultuous shouting crowd, in pursuit of the"
"12777",159,"escaping Leopard-man."
"12778",159,""
"12779",159,"That is all I can tell definitely. I saw the Leopard-man strike Moreau,"
"12780",159,"and then everything spun about me until I was running headlong. M’ling"
"12781",159,"was ahead, close in pursuit of the fugitive. Behind, their tongues"
"12782",159,"already lolling out, ran the Wolf-women in great leaping strides. The"
"12783",159,"Swine folk followed, squealing with excitement, and the two Bull-men in"
"12784",159,"their swathings of white. Then came Moreau in a cluster of the Beast"
"12785",159,"People, his wide-brimmed straw hat blown off, his revolver in hand, and"
"12786",159,"his lank white hair streaming out. The Hyena-swine ran beside me,"
"12787",159,"keeping pace with me and glancing furtively at me out of his feline"
"12788",159,"eyes, and the others came pattering and shouting behind us."
"12789",159,""
"12790",159,"The Leopard-man went bursting his way through the long canes, which"
"12791",159,"sprang back as he passed, and rattled in M’ling’s face. We others in"
"12792",159,"the rear found a trampled path for us when we reached the brake. The"
"12793",159,"chase lay through the brake for perhaps a quarter of a mile, and then"
"12794",159,"plunged into a dense thicket, which retarded our movements exceedingly,"
"12795",159,"though we went through it in a crowd together,—fronds flicking into our"
"12796",159,"faces, ropy creepers catching us under the chin or gripping our ankles,"
"12797",159,"thorny plants hooking into and tearing cloth and flesh together."
"12798",159,""
"12799",159,"“He has gone on all-fours through this,” panted Moreau, now just ahead"
"12800",159,"of me."
"12801",159,""
"12802",159,"“None escape,” said the Wolf-bear, laughing into my face with the"
"12803",159,"exultation of hunting. We burst out again among rocks, and saw the"
"12804",159,"quarry ahead running lightly on all-fours and snarling at us over his"
"12805",159,"shoulder. At that the Wolf Folk howled with delight. The Thing was"
"12806",159,"still clothed, and at a distance its face still seemed human; but the"
"12807",159,"carriage of its four limbs was feline, and the furtive droop of its"
"12808",159,"shoulder was distinctly that of a hunted animal. It leapt over some"
"12809",159,"thorny yellow-flowering bushes, and was hidden. M’ling was halfway"
"12810",159,"across the space."
"12811",159,""
"12812",159,"Most of us now had lost the first speed of the chase, and had fallen"
"12813",159,"into a longer and steadier stride. I saw as we traversed the open that"
"12814",159,"the pursuit was now spreading from a column into a line. The"
"12815",159,"Hyena-swine still ran close to me, watching me as it ran, every now and"
"12816",159,"then puckering its muzzle with a snarling laugh. At the edge of the"
"12817",159,"rocks the Leopard-man, realising that he was making for the projecting"
"12818",159,"cape upon which he had stalked me on the night of my arrival, had"
"12819",159,"doubled in the undergrowth; but Montgomery had seen the manoeuvre, and"
"12820",159,"turned him again. So, panting, tumbling against rocks, torn by"
"12821",159,"brambles, impeded by ferns and reeds, I helped to pursue the"
"12822",159,"Leopard-man who had broken the Law, and the Hyena-swine ran, laughing"
"12823",159,"savagely, by my side. I staggered on, my head reeling and my heart"
"12824",159,"beating against my ribs, tired almost to death, and yet not daring to"
"12825",159,"lose sight of the chase lest I should be left alone with this horrible"
"12826",159,"companion. I staggered on in spite of infinite fatigue and the dense"
"12827",159,"heat of the tropical afternoon."
"12828",159,""
"12829",159,"At last the fury of the hunt slackened. We had pinned the wretched"
"12830",159,"brute into a corner of the island. Moreau, whip in hand, marshalled us"
"12831",159,"all into an irregular line, and we advanced now slowly, shouting to one"
"12832",159,"another as we advanced and tightening the cordon about our victim. He"
"12833",159,"lurked noiseless and invisible in the bushes through which I had run"
"12834",159,"from him during that midnight pursuit."
"12835",159,""
"12836",159,"“Steady!” cried Moreau, “steady!” as the ends of the line crept round"
"12837",159,"the tangle of undergrowth and hemmed the brute in."
"12838",159,""
"12839",159,"“Ware a rush!” came the voice of Montgomery from beyond the thicket."
"12840",159,""
"12841",159,"I was on the slope above the bushes; Montgomery and Moreau beat along"
"12842",159,"the beach beneath. Slowly we pushed in among the fretted network of"
"12843",159,"branches and leaves. The quarry was silent."
"12844",159,""
"12845",159,"“Back to the House of Pain, the House of Pain, the House of Pain!”"

"12847",159,""
"12848",159,"When I heard that, I forgave the poor wretch all the fear he had"
"12849",159,"inspired in me. I heard the twigs snap and the boughs swish aside"
"12850",159,"before the heavy tread of the Horse-rhinoceros upon my right. Then"
"12851",159,"suddenly through a polygon of green, in the half darkness under the"
"12852",159,"luxuriant growth, I saw the creature we were hunting. I halted. He was"
"12853",159,"crouched together into the smallest possible compass, his luminous"
"12854",159,"green eyes turned over his shoulder regarding me."
"12855",159,""
"12856",159,"It may seem a strange contradiction in me,—I cannot explain the"
"12857",159,"fact,—but now, seeing the creature there in a perfectly animal"
"12858",159,"attitude, with the light gleaming in its eyes and its imperfectly human"

"12862",159,"of the enclosure. Abruptly I slipped out my revolver, aimed between its"
"12863",159,"terror-struck eyes, and fired. As I did so, the Hyena-swine saw the"
"12864",159,"Thing, and flung itself upon it with an eager cry, thrusting thirsty"
"12865",159,"teeth into its neck. All about me the green masses of the thicket were"
"12866",159,"swaying and cracking as the Beast People came rushing together. One"
"12867",159,"face and then another appeared."

"12869",159,"“Don’t kill it, Prendick!” cried Moreau. “Don’t kill it!” and I saw him"

"12875",159,"quivering body. The hairy-grey Thing came sniffing at the corpse under"

"12881",159,"“I’m sorry,” said I, though I was not. “It was the impulse of the"
"12882",159,"moment.” I felt sick with exertion and excitement. Turning, I pushed my"
"12883",159,"way out of the crowding Beast People and went on alone up the slope"
"12884",159,"towards the higher part of the headland. Under the shouted directions"
"12885",159,"of Moreau I heard the three white-swathed Bull-men begin dragging the"
"12886",159,"victim down towards the water."
"12887",159,""
"12888",159,"It was easy now for me to be alone. The Beast People manifested a quite"
"12889",159,"human curiosity about the dead body, and followed it in a thick knot,"
"12890",159,"sniffing and growling at it as the Bull-men dragged it down the beach."
"12891",159,"I went to the headland and watched the bull-men, black against the"
"12892",159,"evening sky as they carried the weighted dead body out to sea; and like"
"12893",159,"a wave across my mind came the realisation of the unspeakable"
"12894",159,"aimlessness of things upon the island. Upon the beach among the rocks"
"12895",159,"beneath me were the Ape-man, the Hyena-swine, and several other of the"
"12896",159,"Beast People, standing about Montgomery and Moreau. They were all still"
"12897",159,"intensely excited, and all overflowing with noisy expressions of their"
"12898",159,"loyalty to the Law; yet I felt an absolute assurance in my own mind"
"12899",159,"that the Hyena-swine was implicated in the rabbit-killing. A strange"
"12900",159,"persuasion came upon me, that, save for the grossness of the line, the"
"12901",159,"grotesqueness of the forms, I had here before me the whole balance of"
"12902",159,"human life in miniature, the whole interplay of instinct, reason, and"
"12903",159,"fate in its simplest form. The Leopard-man had happened to go under:"
"12904",159,"that was all the difference. Poor brute!"

"12909",159,"at the days of actual torment in the enclosure. But now that seemed to"
"12910",159,"me the lesser part. Before, they had been beasts, their instincts fitly"
"12911",159,"adapted to their surroundings, and happy as living things may be. Now"
"12912",159,"they stumbled in the shackles of humanity, lived in a fear that never"
"12913",159,"died, fretted by a law they could not understand; their mock-human"
"12914",159,"existence, begun in an agony, was one long internal struggle, one long"

"12920",159,"could have forgiven him a little even, had his motive been only hate."
"12921",159,"But he was so irresponsible, so utterly careless! His curiosity, his"
"12922",159,"mad, aimless investigations, drove him on; and the Things were thrown"
"12923",159,"out to live a year or so, to struggle and blunder and suffer, and at"
"12924",159,"last to die painfully. They were wretched in themselves; the old animal"

"12987",159,"massive white face all the more terrible for the blood that trickled"
"12988",159,"from his forehead. He carried a revolver in one hand. He scarcely"
"12989",159,"glanced at me, but rushed off at once in pursuit of the puma."

"12991",159,"I tried the other arm and sat up. The muffled figure in front ran in"

"12993",159,"turned her head and saw him, then doubling abruptly made for the"
"12994",159,"bushes. She gained upon him at every stride. I saw her plunge into"
"12995",159,"them, and Moreau, running slantingly to intercept her, fired and missed"
"12996",159,"as she disappeared. Then he too vanished in the green confusion. I"
"12997",159,"stared after them, and then the pain in my arm flamed up, and with a"

"13010",159,"“Tell me exactly how it happened—what happened?”"

"13012",159,"I told him what I had seen; told him in broken sentences, with gasps of"

"13024",159,"my arm had already given way to a burning pain when Montgomery"
"13025",159,"reappeared. His face was rather pale, and he showed more of his lower"

"13028",159,"“I can neither see nor hear anything of him,” he said. “I’ve been"

"13030",159,"eyes. “That was a strong brute,” he said. “It simply wrenched its"
"13031",159,"fetter out of the wall.” He went to the window, then to the door, and"
"13032",159,"there turned to me. “I shall go after him,” he said. “There’s another"
"13033",159,"revolver I can leave with you. To tell you the truth, I feel anxious"
"13034",159,"somehow.”"
"13035",159,""
"13036",159,"He obtained the weapon, and put it ready to my hand on the table; then"
"13037",159,"went out, leaving a restless contagion in the air. I did not sit long"

"13040",159,"The morning was as still as death. Not a whisper of wind was stirring;"

"13046",159,"Moreau and Montgomery. When would they return, and how? Then far away"
"13047",159,"up the beach a little grey Beast Man appeared, ran down to the water’s"
"13048",159,"edge and began splashing about. I strolled back to the doorway, then to"
"13049",159,"the corner again, and so began pacing to and fro like a sentinel upon"
"13050",159,"duty. Once I was arrested by the distant voice of Montgomery bawling,"
"13051",159,"“Coo-ee—Moreau!” My arm became less painful, but very hot. I got"
"13052",159,"feverish and thirsty. My shadow grew shorter. I watched the distant"
"13053",159,"figure until it went away again. Would Moreau and Montgomery never"
"13054",159,"return? Three sea-birds began fighting for some stranded treasure."

"13062",159,"consternation. Behind him slouched the Beast Man, M’ling, and round"

"13076",159,"panting like a dog. I got Montgomery some brandy-and-water. He sat"
"13077",159,"staring in front of him at nothing, recovering his breath. After some"
"13078",159,"minutes he began to tell me what had happened."
"13079",159,""
"13080",159,"He had followed their track for some way. It was plain enough at first"

"13082",159,"puma’s bandages, and occasional smears of blood on the leaves of the"
"13083",159,"shrubs and undergrowth. He lost the track, however, on the stony ground"
"13084",159,"beyond the stream where I had seen the Beast Man drinking, and went"
"13085",159,"wandering aimlessly westward shouting Moreau’s name. Then M’ling had"
"13086",159,"come to him carrying a light hatchet. M’ling had seen nothing of the"
"13087",159,"puma affair; had been felling wood, and heard him calling. They went on"
"13088",159,"shouting together. Two Beast Men came crouching and peering at them"
"13089",159,"through the undergrowth, with gestures and a furtive carriage that"
"13090",159,"alarmed Montgomery by their strangeness. He hailed them, and they fled"
"13091",159,"guiltily. He stopped shouting after that, and after wandering some time"
"13092",159,"farther in an undecided way, determined to visit the huts."

"13094",159,"He found the ravine deserted."
"13095",159,""
"13096",159,"Growing more alarmed every minute, he began to retrace his steps. Then"
"13097",159,"it was he encountered the two Swine-men I had seen dancing on the night"
"13098",159,"of my arrival; blood-stained they were about the mouth, and intensely"
"13099",159,"excited. They came crashing through the ferns, and stopped with fierce"
"13100",159,"faces when they saw him. He cracked his whip in some trepidation, and"
"13101",159,"forthwith they rushed at him. Never before had a Beast Man dared to do"
"13102",159,"that. One he shot through the head; M’ling flung himself upon the"
"13103",159,"other, and the two rolled grappling. M’ling got his brute under and"
"13104",159,"with his teeth in its throat, and Montgomery shot that too as it"
"13105",159,"struggled in M’ling’s grip. He had some difficulty in inducing M’ling"
"13106",159,"to come on with him. Thence they had hurried back to me. On the way,"
"13107",159,"M’ling had suddenly rushed into a thicket and driven out an under-sized"
"13108",159,"Ocelot-man, also blood-stained, and lame through a wound in the foot."

"13179",159,"“Beyond,” and the grey creature pointed."
"13180",159,""
"13181",159,"“Is there a Law now?” asked the Monkey-man. “Is it still to be this and"
"13182",159,"that? Is he dead indeed?”"
"13183",159,""
"13184",159,"“Is there a Law?” repeated the man in white. “Is there a Law, thou"
"13185",159,"Other with the Whip?”"
"13186",159,""
"13187",159,"“He is dead,” said the hairy-grey Thing. And they all stood watching"

"13193",159,"I had been standing behind him during this colloquy. I began to see how"
"13194",159,"things lay with them. I suddenly stepped in front of Montgomery and"
"13195",159,"lifted up my voice:—“Children of the Law,” I said, “he is _not_ dead!”"
"13196",159,"M’ling turned his sharp eyes on me. “He has changed his shape; he has"
"13197",159,"changed his body,” I went on. “For a time you will not see him. He"
"13198",159,"is—there,” I pointed upward, “where he can watch you. You cannot see"
"13199",159,"him, but he can see you. Fear the Law!”"
"13200",159,""
"13201",159,"I looked at them squarely. They flinched."
"13202",159,""
"13203",159,"“He is great, he is good,” said the Ape-man, peering fearfully upward"
"13204",159,"among the dense trees."

"13206",159,"“And the other Thing?” I demanded."
"13207",159,""
"13208",159,"“The Thing that bled, and ran screaming and sobbing,—that is dead too,”"
"13209",159,"said the grey Thing, still regarding me."

"13211",159,"“That’s well,” grunted Montgomery."

"13217",159,"“Said he was dead.”"
"13218",159,""
"13219",159,"But Montgomery was still sober enough to understand my motive in"
"13220",159,"denying Moreau’s death. “He is not dead,” he said slowly, “not dead at"
"13221",159,"all. No more dead than I am.”"
"13222",159,""
"13223",159,"“Some,” said I, “have broken the Law: they will die. Some have died."

"13225",159,"had no more need of it.”"

"13227",159,"“It is this way, Man who walked in the Sea,” said the grey Thing."
"13228",159,""
"13229",159,"And with these six creatures guiding us, we went through the tumult of"
"13230",159,"ferns and creepers and tree-stems towards the northwest. Then came a"
"13231",159,"yelling, a crashing among the branches, and a little pink homunculus"
"13232",159,"rushed by us shrieking. Immediately after appeared a monster in"
"13233",159,"headlong pursuit, blood-bedabbled, who was amongst us almost before he"
"13234",159,"could stop his career. The grey Thing leapt aside. M’ling, with a"
"13235",159,"snarl, flew at it, and was struck aside. Montgomery fired and missed,"
"13236",159,"bowed his head, threw up his arm, and turned to run. I fired, and the"
"13237",159,"Thing still came on; fired again, point-blank, into its ugly face. I"
"13238",159,"saw its features vanish in a flash: its face was driven in. Yet it"
"13239",159,"passed me, gripped Montgomery, and holding him, fell headlong beside"

"13242",159,"I found myself alone with M’ling, the dead brute, and the prostrate"
"13243",159,"man. Montgomery raised himself slowly and stared in a muddled way at"
"13244",159,"the shattered Beast Man beside him. It more than half sobered him. He"
"13245",159,"scrambled to his feet. Then I saw the grey Thing returning cautiously"
"13246",159,"through the trees."

"13248",159,"“See,” said I, pointing to the dead brute, “is the Law not alive? This"
"13249",159,"came of breaking the Law.”"

"13251",159,"He peered at the body. “He sends the Fire that kills,” said he, in his"
"13252",159,"deep voice, repeating part of the Ritual. The others gathered round and"
"13253",159,"stared for a space."
"13254",159,""
"13255",159,"At last we drew near the westward extremity of the island. We came upon"
"13256",159,"the gnawed and mutilated body of the puma, its shoulder-bone smashed by"
"13257",159,"a bullet, and perhaps twenty yards farther found at last what we"
"13258",159,"sought. Moreau lay face downward in a trampled space in a canebrake."
"13259",159,"One hand was almost severed at the wrist and his silvery hair was"
"13260",159,"dabbled in blood. His head had been battered in by the fetters of the"
"13261",159,"puma. The broken canes beneath him were smeared with blood. His"
"13262",159,"revolver we could not find. Montgomery turned him over. Resting at"
"13263",159,"intervals, and with the help of the seven Beast People (for he was a"
"13264",159,"heavy man), we carried Moreau back to the enclosure. The night was"
"13265",159,"darkling. Twice we heard unseen creatures howling and shrieking past"
"13266",159,"our little band, and once the little pink sloth-creature appeared and"
"13267",159,"stared at us, and vanished again. But we were not attacked again. At"
"13268",159,"the gates of the enclosure our company of Beast People left us, M’ling"
"13269",159,"going with the rest. We locked ourselves in, and then took Moreau’s"
"13270",159,"mangled body into the yard and laid it upon a pile of brushwood. Then"
"13271",159,"we went into the laboratory and put an end to all we found living"

"13284",159,"disturbed in his mind. He had been strangely under the influence of"
"13285",159,"Moreau’s personality: I do not think it had ever occurred to him that"
"13286",159,"Moreau could die. This disaster was the sudden collapse of the habits"
"13287",159,"that had become part of his nature in the ten or more monotonous years"
"13288",159,"he had spent on the island. He talked vaguely, answered my questions"

"13294",159,"in London grinding hard at medicine, bad food, shabby lodgings, shabby"
"13295",159,"clothes, shabby vice, a blunder,—_I_ didn’t know any better,—and"
"13296",159,"hustled off to this beastly island. Ten years here! What’s it all for,"
"13297",159,"Prendick? Are we bubbles blown by a baby?”"
"13298",159,""
"13299",159,"It was hard to deal with such ravings. “The thing we have to think of"

"13302",159,"“What’s the good of getting away? I’m an outcast. Where am _I_ to join"
"13303",159,"on? It’s all very well for _you_, Prendick. Poor old Moreau! We can’t"
"13304",159,"leave him here to have his bones picked. As it is—And besides, what"
"13305",159,"will become of the decent part of the Beast Folk?”"
"13306",159,""
"13307",159,"“Well,” said I, “that will do to-morrow. I’ve been thinking we might"

"13309",159,"things. Then what will happen with the Beast Folk?”"
"13310",159,""
"13311",159,"“_I_ don’t know. I suppose those that were made of beasts of prey will"

"13318",159,"“Damnation!” he exclaimed at some petulance of mine; “can’t you see I’m"
"13319",159,"in a worse hole than you are?” And he got up, and went for the brandy."

"13326",159,"I have a memory of infinite tedium. He wandered into a maudlin defence"

"13344",159,"he put his hand upon the latch, but deterred by the thought of my"
"13345",159,"useless arm. “You’ve made a beast of yourself,—to the beasts you may"

"13361",159,"hunched shoulders as he came round the corner of the house."

"13363",159,"“Drink!” cried Montgomery, “drink, you brutes! Drink and be men! Damme,"
"13364",159,"I’m the cleverest. Moreau forgot this; this is the last touch. Drink, I"
"13365",159,"tell you!” And waving the bottle in his hand he started off at a kind"
"13366",159,"of quick trot to the westward, M’ling ranging himself between him and"

"13368",159,""
"13369",159,"I went to the doorway. They were already indistinct in the mist of the"
"13370",159,"moonlight before Montgomery halted. I saw him administer a dose of the"
"13371",159,"raw brandy to M’ling, and saw the five figures melt into one vague"
"13372",159,"patch."

"13376",159,""
"13377",159,"The black group broke up into five separate figures, and wound slowly"
"13378",159,"away from me along the band of shining beach. Each went howling at his"
"13379",159,"own sweet will, yelping insults at me, or giving whatever other vent"
"13380",159,"this new inspiration of brandy demanded. Presently I heard Montgomery’s"
"13381",159,"voice shouting, “Right turn!” and they passed with their shouts and"
"13382",159,"howls into the blackness of the landward trees. Slowly, very slowly,"
"13383",159,"they receded into silence."
"13384",159,""
"13385",159,"The peaceful splendour of the night healed again. The moon was now past"
"13386",159,"the meridian and travelling down the west. It was at its full, and very"
"13387",159,"bright riding through the empty blue sky. The shadow of the wall lay, a"
"13388",159,"yard wide and of inky blackness, at my feet. The eastward sea was a"
"13389",159,"featureless grey, dark and mysterious; and between the sea and the"
"13390",159,"shadow the grey sands (of volcanic glass and crystals) flashed and"
"13391",159,"shone like a beach of diamonds. Behind me the paraffine lamp flared hot"
"13392",159,"and ruddy."
"13393",159,""
"13394",159,"Then I shut the door, locked it, and went into the enclosure where"
"13395",159,"Moreau lay beside his latest victims,—the staghounds and the llama and"
"13396",159,"some other wretched brutes,—with his massive face calm even after his"
"13397",159,"terrible death, and with the hard eyes open, staring at the dead white"
"13398",159,"moon above. I sat down upon the edge of the sink, and with my eyes upon"
"13399",159,"that ghastly pile of silvery light and ominous shadows began to turn"
"13400",159,"over my plans. In the morning I would gather some provisions in the"
"13401",159,"dingey, and after setting fire to the pyre before me, push out into the"
"13402",159,"desolation of the high sea once more. I felt that for Montgomery there"
"13403",159,"was no help; that he was, in truth, half akin to these Beast Folk,"
"13404",159,"unfitted for human kindred."
"13405",159,""
"13406",159,"I do not know how long I sat there scheming. It must have been an hour"
"13407",159,"or so. Then my planning was interrupted by the return of Montgomery to"
"13408",159,"my neighbourhood. I heard a yelling from many throats, a tumult of"
"13409",159,"exultant cries passing down towards the beach, whooping and howling,"
"13410",159,"and excited shrieks that seemed to come to a stop near the water’s"
"13411",159,"edge. The riot rose and fell; I heard heavy blows and the splintering"
"13412",159,"smash of wood, but it did not trouble me then. A discordant chanting"
"13413",159,"began."
"13414",159,""
"13415",159,"My thoughts went back to my means of escape. I got up, brought the"
"13416",159,"lamp, and went into a shed to look at some kegs I had seen there. Then"
"13417",159,"I became interested in the contents of some biscuit-tins, and opened"
"13418",159,"one. I saw something out of the tail of my eye,—a red figure,—and"
"13419",159,"turned sharply."
"13420",159,""
"13421",159,"Behind me lay the yard, vividly black-and-white in the moonlight, and"
"13422",159,"the pile of wood and faggots on which Moreau and his mutilated victims"
"13423",159,"lay, one over another. They seemed to be gripping one another in one"
"13424",159,"last revengeful grapple. His wounds gaped, black as night, and the"
"13425",159,"blood that had dripped lay in black patches upon the sand. Then I saw,"
"13426",159,"without understanding, the cause of my phantom,—a ruddy glow that came"
"13427",159,"and danced and went upon the wall opposite. I misinterpreted this,"
"13428",159,"fancied it was a reflection of my flickering lamp, and turned again to"
"13429",159,"the stores in the shed. I went on rummaging among them, as well as a"
"13430",159,"one-armed man could, finding this convenient thing and that, and"
"13431",159,"putting them aside for to-morrow’s launch. My movements were slow, and"
"13432",159,"the time passed quickly. Insensibly the daylight crept upon me."
"13433",159,""
"13434",159,"The chanting died down, giving place to a clamour; then it began again,"
"13435",159,"and suddenly broke into a tumult. I heard cries of, “More! more!” a"
"13436",159,"sound like quarrelling, and a sudden wild shriek. The quality of the"
"13437",159,"sounds changed so greatly that it arrested my attention. I went out"
"13438",159,"into the yard and listened. Then cutting like a knife across the"
"13439",159,"confusion came the crack of a revolver."
"13440",159,""
"13441",159,"I rushed at once through my room to the little doorway. As I did so I"

"13446",159,"Up the beach by the boathouse a bonfire was burning, raining up sparks"

"13451",159,"shouted with all my strength and fired into the air. I heard some one"
"13452",159,"cry, “The Master!” The knotted black struggle broke into scattering"
"13453",159,"units, the fire leapt and sank down. The crowd of Beast People fled in"
"13454",159,"sudden panic before me, up the beach. In my excitement I fired at their"

"13461",159,"still, his neck bitten open and the upper part of the smashed"
"13462",159,"brandy-bottle in his hand. Two other figures lay near the fire,—the one"
"13463",159,"motionless, the other groaning fitfully, every now and then raising its"
"13464",159,"head slowly, then dropping it again."

"13472",159,"upon the still glowing timber. The wretched thing was injured so"
"13473",159,"dreadfully that in mercy I blew its brains out at once. The other brute"

"13500",159,"were gone! Two axes lay upon the sands beside me; chips and splinters"
"13501",159,"were scattered broadcast, and the ashes of the bonfire were blackening"

"13512",159,"“Sorry,” he said presently, with an effort. He seemed trying to think."

"13518",159,"bring drink at hand. He seemed suddenly heavier. My heart went cold. I"
"13519",159,"bent down to his face, put my hand through the rent in his blouse. He"
"13520",159,"was dead; and even as he died a line of white heat, the limb of the"
"13521",159,"sun, rose eastward beyond the projection of the bay, splashing its"

"13528",159,"awful solitude upon which I had already suffered so much; behind me the"
"13529",159,"island, hushed under the dawn, its Beast People silent and unseen. The"
"13530",159,"enclosure, with all its provisions and ammunition, burnt noisily, with"
"13531",159,"sudden gusts of flame, a fitful crackling, and now and then a crash."

"13631",159,""
"13632",159,"Perhaps a little too spasmodically I drew my revolver, aimed quickly"
"13633",159,"and fired. I heard him yelp, saw him run sideways and turn, knew I had"
"13634",159,"missed, and clicked back the cock with my thumb for the next shot. But"
"13635",159,"he was already running headlong, jumping from side to side, and I dared"
"13636",159,"not risk another miss. Every now and then he looked back at me over his"
"13637",159,"shoulder. He went slanting along the beach, and vanished beneath the"
"13638",159,"driving masses of dense smoke that were still pouring out from the"
"13639",159,"burning enclosure. For some time I stood staring after him. I turned to"
"13640",159,"my three obedient Beast Folk again and signalled them to drop the body"
"13641",159,"they still carried. Then I went back to the place by the fire where the"
"13642",159,"bodies had fallen and kicked the sand until all the brown blood-stains"
"13643",159,"were absorbed and hidden."
"13644",159,""
"13645",159,"I dismissed my three serfs with a wave of the hand, and went up the"
"13646",159,"beach into the thickets. I carried my pistol in my hand, my whip thrust"
"13647",159,"with the hatchets in the sling of my arm. I was anxious to be alone, to"
"13648",159,"think out the position in which I was now placed. A dreadful thing that"
"13649",159,"I was only beginning to realise was, that over all this island there"
"13650",159,"was now no safe place where I could be alone and secure to rest or"
"13651",159,"sleep. I had recovered strength amazingly since my landing, but I was"
"13652",159,"still inclined to be nervous and to break down under any great stress."
"13653",159,"I felt that I ought to cross the island and establish myself with the"
"13654",159,"Beast People, and make myself secure in their confidence. But my heart"
"13655",159,"failed me. I went back to the beach, and turning eastward past the"
"13656",159,"burning enclosure, made for a point where a shallow spit of coral sand"
"13657",159,"ran out towards the reef. Here I could sit down and think, my back to"
"13658",159,"the sea and my face against any surprise. And there I sat, chin on"
"13659",159,"knees, the sun beating down upon my head and unspeakable dread in my"
"13660",159,"mind, plotting how I could live on against the hour of my rescue (if"
"13661",159,"ever rescue came). I tried to review the whole situation as calmly as I"
"13662",159,"could, but it was difficult to clear the thing of emotion."
"13663",159,""
"13664",159,"I began turning over in my mind the reason of Montgomery’s despair."
"13665",159,"“They will change,” he said; “they are sure to change.” And Moreau,"
"13666",159,"what was it that Moreau had said? “The stubborn beast-flesh grows day"
"13667",159,"by day back again.” Then I came round to the Hyena-swine. I felt sure"
"13668",159,"that if I did not kill that brute, he would kill me. The Sayer of the"
"13669",159,"Law was dead: worse luck. They knew now that we of the Whips could be"
"13670",159,"killed even as they themselves were killed. Were they peering at me"
"13671",159,"already out of the green masses of ferns and palms over yonder,"
"13672",159,"watching until I came within their spring? Were they plotting against"
"13673",159,"me? What was the Hyena-swine telling them? My imagination was running"
"13674",159,"away with me into a morass of unsubstantial fears."
"13675",159,""
"13676",159,"My thoughts were disturbed by a crying of sea-birds hurrying towards"
"13677",159,"some black object that had been stranded by the waves on the beach near"
"13678",159,"the enclosure. I knew what that object was, but I had not the heart to"
"13679",159,"go back and drive them off. I began walking along the beach in the"
"13680",159,"opposite direction, designing to come round the eastward corner of the"
"13681",159,"island and so approach the ravine of the huts, without traversing the"
"13682",159,"possible ambuscades of the thickets."
"13683",159,""
"13684",159,"Perhaps half a mile along the beach I became aware of one of my three"
"13685",159,"Beast Folk advancing out of the landward bushes towards me. I was now"
"13686",159,"so nervous with my own imaginings that I immediately drew my revolver."
"13687",159,"Even the propitiatory gestures of the creature failed to disarm me. He"
"13688",159,"hesitated as he approached."
"13689",159,""
"13690",159,"“Go away!” cried I."
"13691",159,""
"13692",159,"There was something very suggestive of a dog in the cringing attitude"
"13693",159,"of the creature. It retreated a little way, very like a dog being sent"
"13694",159,"home, and stopped, looking at me imploringly with canine brown eyes."
"13695",159,""
"13696",159,"“Go away,” said I. “Do not come near me.”"
"13697",159,""
"13698",159,"“May I not come near you?” it said."
"13699",159,""
"13700",159,"“No; go away,” I insisted, and snapped my whip. Then putting my whip in"
"13701",159,"my teeth, I stooped for a stone, and with that threat drove the"
"13702",159,"creature away."
"13703",159,""
"13704",159,"So in solitude I came round by the ravine of the Beast People, and"
"13705",159,"hiding among the weeds and reeds that separated this crevice from the"

"13707",159,"gestures and appearance how the death of Moreau and Montgomery and the"
"13708",159,"destruction of the House of Pain had affected them. I know now the"
"13709",159,"folly of my cowardice. Had I kept my courage up to the level of the"
"13710",159,"dawn, had I not allowed it to ebb away in solitary thought, I might"
"13711",159,"have grasped the vacant sceptre of Moreau and ruled over the Beast"
"13712",159,"People. As it was I lost the opportunity, and sank to the position of a"
"13713",159,"mere leader among my fellows."

"13718",159,"these seated figures. One, a Wolf-woman, turned her head and stared at"
"13719",159,"me, and then the others. None attempted to rise or salute me. I felt"

"13854",159,"talked now without the catching in my breath, due to the intensity of"
"13855",159,"my excitement, that had troubled me at first. In the course of about an"
"13856",159,"hour I had really convinced several of the Beast Folk of the truth of"
"13857",159,"my assertions, and talked most of the others into a dubious state. I"

"13862",159,"light of the sinking fire), and first one and then another retired"
"13863",159,"towards the dens in the ravine; and I, dreading the silence and"

"13872",159,"cardinal incident of the ten months I spent as an intimate of these"

"13877",159,"In the retrospect it is strange to remember how soon I fell in with"
"13878",159,"these monsters’ ways, and gained my confidence again. I had my quarrels"
"13879",159,"with them of course, and could show some of their teeth-marks still;"
"13880",159,"but they soon gained a wholesome respect for my trick of throwing"
"13881",159,"stones and for the bite of my hatchet. And my Saint-Bernard-man’s"
"13882",159,"loyalty was of infinite service to me. I found their simple scale of"
"13883",159,"honour was based mainly on the capacity for inflicting trenchant"
"13884",159,"wounds. Indeed, I may say—without vanity, I hope—that I held something"
"13885",159,"like pre-eminence among them. One or two, whom in a rare access of high"
"13886",159,"spirits I had scarred rather badly, bore me a grudge; but it vented"
"13887",159,"itself chiefly behind my back, and at a safe distance from my missiles,"
"13888",159,"in grimaces."
"13889",159,""
"13890",159,"The Hyena-swine avoided me, and I was always on the alert for him. My"
"13891",159,"inseparable Dog-man hated and dreaded him intensely. I really believe"
"13892",159,"that was at the root of the brute’s attachment to me. It was soon"
"13893",159,"evident to me that the former monster had tasted blood, and gone the"
"13894",159,"way of the Leopard-man. He formed a lair somewhere in the forest, and"
"13895",159,"became solitary. Once I tried to induce the Beast Folk to hunt him, but"
"13896",159,"I lacked the authority to make them co-operate for one end. Again and"
"13897",159,"again I tried to approach his den and come upon him unaware; but always"
"13898",159,"he was too acute for me, and saw or winded me and got away. He too made"
"13899",159,"every forest pathway dangerous to me and my ally with his lurking"
"13900",159,"ambuscades. The Dog-man scarcely dared to leave my side."

"13902",159,"In the first month or so the Beast Folk, compared with their latter"
"13903",159,"condition, were human enough, and for one or two besides my canine"
"13904",159,"friend I even conceived a friendly tolerance. The little pink"
"13905",159,"sloth-creature displayed an odd affection for me, and took to following"
"13906",159,"me about. The Monkey-man bored me, however; he assumed, on the strength"
"13907",159,"of his five digits, that he was my equal, and was for ever jabbering at"
"13908",159,"me,—jabbering the most arrant nonsense. One thing about him entertained"
"13909",159,"me a little: he had a fantastic trick of coining new words. He had an"
"13910",159,"idea, I believe, that to gabble about names that meant nothing was the"
"13911",159,"proper use of speech. He called it “Big Thinks” to distinguish it from"
"13912",159,"“Little Thinks,” the sane every-day interests of life. If ever I made a"
"13913",159,"remark he did not understand, he would praise it very much, ask me to"
"13914",159,"say it again, learn it by heart, and go off repeating it, with a word"
"13915",159,"wrong here or there, to all the milder of the Beast People. He thought"
"13916",159,"nothing of what was plain and comprehensible. I invented some very"
"13917",159,"curious “Big Thinks” for his especial use. I think now that he was the"
"13918",159,"silliest creature I ever met; he had developed in the most wonderful"
"13919",159,"way the distinctive silliness of man without losing one jot of the"
"13920",159,"natural folly of a monkey."
"13921",159,""
"13922",159,"This, I say, was in the earlier weeks of my solitude among these"
"13923",159,"brutes. During that time they respected the usage established by the"
"13924",159,"Law, and behaved with general decorum. Once I found another rabbit torn"
"13925",159,"to pieces,—by the Hyena-swine, I am assured,—but that was all. It was"
"13926",159,"about May when I first distinctly perceived a growing difference in"
"13927",159,"their speech and carriage, a growing coarseness of articulation, a"
"13928",159,"growing disinclination to talk. My Monkey-man’s jabber multiplied in"
"13929",159,"volume but grew less and less comprehensible, more and more simian."
"13930",159,"Some of the others seemed altogether slipping their hold upon speech,"
"13931",159,"though they still understood what I said to them at that time. (Can you"
"13932",159,"imagine language, once clear-cut and exact, softening and guttering,"
"13933",159,"losing shape and import, becoming mere lumps of sound again?) And they"
"13934",159,"walked erect with an increasing difficulty. Though they evidently felt"
"13935",159,"ashamed of themselves, every now and then I would come upon one or"
"13936",159,"another running on toes and finger-tips, and quite unable to recover"
"13937",159,"the vertical attitude. They held things more clumsily; drinking by"
"13938",159,"suction, feeding by gnawing, grew commoner every day. I realised more"
"13939",159,"keenly than ever what Moreau had told me about the “stubborn"
"13940",159,"beast-flesh.” They were reverting, and reverting very rapidly."
"13941",159,""
"13942",159,"Some of them—the pioneers in this, I noticed with some surprise, were"

"13944",159,"for the most part. Others even attempted public outrages upon the"
"13945",159,"institution of monogamy. The tradition of the Law was clearly losing"
"13946",159,"its force. I cannot pursue this disagreeable subject."

"13948",159,"My Dog-man imperceptibly slipped back to the dog again; day by day he"
"13949",159,"became dumb, quadrupedal, hairy. I scarcely noticed the transition from"

"13951",159,""
"13952",159,"As the carelessness and disorganisation increased from day to day, the"
"13953",159,"lane of dwelling places, at no time very sweet, became so loathsome"
"13954",159,"that I left it, and going across the island made myself a hovel of"
"13955",159,"boughs amid the black ruins of Moreau’s enclosure. Some memory of pain,"
"13956",159,"I found, still made that place the safest from the Beast Folk."

"13958",159,"It would be impossible to detail every step of the lapsing of these"
"13959",159,"monsters,—to tell how, day by day, the human semblance left them; how"
"13960",159,"they gave up bandagings and wrappings, abandoned at last every stitch"
"13961",159,"of clothing; how the hair began to spread over the exposed limbs; how"
"13962",159,"their foreheads fell away and their faces projected; how the"
"13963",159,"quasi-human intimacy I had permitted myself with some of them in the"
"13964",159,"first month of my loneliness became a shuddering horror to recall."
"13965",159,""
"13966",159,"The change was slow and inevitable. For them and for me it came without"
"13967",159,"any definite shock. I still went among them in safety, because no jolt"
"13968",159,"in the downward glide had released the increasing charge of explosive"
"13969",159,"animalism that ousted the human day by day. But I began to fear that"
"13970",159,"soon now that shock must come. My Saint-Bernard-brute followed me to"
"13971",159,"the enclosure every night, and his vigilance enabled me to sleep at"
"13972",159,"times in something like peace. The little pink sloth-thing became shy"
"13973",159,"and left me, to crawl back to its natural life once more among the"
"13974",159,"tree-branches. We were in just the state of equilibrium that would"
"13975",159,"remain in one of those “Happy Family” cages which animal-tamers"
"13976",159,"exhibit, if the tamer were to leave it for ever."

"13980",159,"tigers, oxen, swine, and apes. There was still something strange about"
"13981",159,"each; in each Moreau had blended this animal with that. One perhaps was"
"13982",159,"ursine chiefly, another feline chiefly, another bovine chiefly; but"
"13983",159,"each was tainted with other creatures,—a kind of generalised animalism"
"13984",159,"appearing through the specific dispositions. And the dwindling shreds"
"13985",159,"of the humanity still startled me every now and then,—a momentary"
"13986",159,"recrudescence of speech perhaps, an unexpected dexterity of the"
"13987",159,"fore-feet, a pitiful attempt to walk erect."
"13988",159,""
"13989",159,"I too must have undergone strange changes. My clothes hung about me as"
"13990",159,"yellow rags, through whose rents showed the tanned skin. My hair grew"
"13991",159,"long, and became matted together. I am told that even now my eyes have"
"13992",159,"a strange brightness, a swift alertness of movement."
"13993",159,""
"13994",159,"At first I spent the daylight hours on the southward beach watching for"
"13995",159,"a ship, hoping and praying for a ship. I counted on the _Ipecacuanha_"
"13996",159,"returning as the year wore on; but she never came. Five times I saw"
"13997",159,"sails, and thrice smoke; but nothing ever touched the island. I always"
"13998",159,"had a bonfire ready, but no doubt the volcanic reputation of the island"
"13999",159,"was taken to account for that."
"14000",159,""
"14001",159,"It was only about September or October that I began to think of making"
"14002",159,"a raft. By that time my arm had healed, and both my hands were at my"
"14003",159,"service again. At first, I found my helplessness appalling. I had never"
"14004",159,"done any carpentry or such-like work in my life, and I spent day after"
"14005",159,"day in experimental chopping and binding among the trees. I had no"
"14006",159,"ropes, and could hit on nothing wherewith to make ropes; none of the"
"14007",159,"abundant creepers seemed limber or strong enough, and with all my"
"14008",159,"litter of scientific education I could not devise any way of making"
"14009",159,"them so. I spent more than a fortnight grubbing among the black ruins"
"14010",159,"of the enclosure and on the beach where the boats had been burnt,"
"14011",159,"looking for nails and other stray pieces of metal that might prove of"
"14012",159,"service. Now and then some Beast-creature would watch me, and go"
"14013",159,"leaping off when I called to it. There came a season of thunder-storms"
"14014",159,"and heavy rain, which greatly retarded my work; but at last the raft"
"14015",159,"was completed."

"14017",159,"I was delighted with it. But with a certain lack of practical sense"
"14018",159,"which has always been my bane, I had made it a mile or more from the"
"14019",159,"sea; and before I had dragged it down to the beach the thing had fallen"
"14020",159,"to pieces. Perhaps it is as well that I was saved from launching it;"
"14021",159,"but at the time my misery at my failure was so acute that for some days"
"14022",159,"I simply moped on the beach, and stared at the water and thought of"
"14023",159,"death."
"14024",159,""
"14025",159,"I did not, however, mean to die, and an incident occurred that warned"

"14029",159,"I was lying in the shade of the enclosure wall, staring out to sea,"

"14031",159,"starting round found the little pink sloth-creature blinking into my"
"14032",159,"face. He had long since lost speech and active movement, and the lank"
"14033",159,"hair of the little brute grew thicker every day and his stumpy claws"
"14034",159,"more askew. He made a moaning noise when he saw he had attracted my"
"14035",159,"attention, went a little way towards the bushes and looked back at me."
"14036",159,""
"14037",159,"At first I did not understand, but presently it occurred to me that he"
"14038",159,"wished me to follow him; and this I did at last,—slowly, for the day"
"14039",159,"was hot. When we reached the trees he clambered into them, for he could"
"14040",159,"travel better among their swinging creepers than on the ground. And"
"14041",159,"suddenly in a trampled space I came upon a ghastly group. My"
"14042",159,"Saint-Bernard-creature lay on the ground, dead; and near his body"
"14043",159,"crouched the Hyena-swine, gripping the quivering flesh with its"
"14044",159,"misshapen claws, gnawing at it, and snarling with delight. As I"
"14045",159,"approached, the monster lifted its glaring eyes to mine, its lips went"
"14046",159,"trembling back from its red-stained teeth, and it growled menacingly."
"14047",159,"It was not afraid and not ashamed; the last vestige of the human taint"
"14048",159,"had vanished. I advanced a step farther, stopped, and pulled out my"
"14049",159,"revolver. At last I had him face to face."
"14050",159,""
"14051",159,"The brute made no sign of retreat; but its ears went back, its hair"
"14052",159,"bristled, and its body crouched together. I aimed between the eyes and"
"14053",159,"fired. As I did so, the Thing rose straight at me in a leap, and I was"
"14054",159,"knocked over like a ninepin. It clutched at me with its crippled hand,"
"14055",159,"and struck me in the face. Its spring carried it over me. I fell under"
"14056",159,"the hind part of its body; but luckily I had hit as I meant, and it had"
"14057",159,"died even as it leapt. I crawled out from under its unclean weight and"
"14058",159,"stood up trembling, staring at its quivering body. That danger at least"
"14059",159,"was over; but this, I knew was only the first of the series of relapses"
"14060",159,"that must come."
"14061",159,""
"14062",159,"I burnt both of the bodies on a pyre of brushwood; but after that I saw"
"14063",159,"that unless I left the island my death was only a question of time. The"
"14064",159,"Beast People by that time had, with one or two exceptions, left the"
"14065",159,"ravine and made themselves lairs according to their taste among the"
"14066",159,"thickets of the island. Few prowled by day, most of them slept, and the"
"14067",159,"island might have seemed deserted to a new-comer; but at night the air"
"14068",159,"was hideous with their calls and howling. I had half a mind to make a"
"14069",159,"massacre of them; to build traps, or fight them with my knife. Had I"
"14070",159,"possessed sufficient cartridges, I should not have hesitated to begin"
"14071",159,"the killing. There could now be scarcely a score left of the dangerous"
"14072",159,"carnivores; the braver of these were already dead. After the death of"
"14073",159,"this poor dog of mine, my last friend, I too adopted to some extent the"
"14074",159,"practice of slumbering in the daytime in order to be on my guard at"
"14075",159,"night. I rebuilt my den in the walls of the enclosure, with such a"
"14076",159,"narrow opening that anything attempting to enter must necessarily make"
"14077",159,"a considerable noise. The creatures had lost the art of fire too, and"
"14078",159,"recovered their fear of it. I turned once more, almost passionately"
"14079",159,"now, to hammering together stakes and branches to form a raft for my"
"14080",159,"escape."
"14081",159,""
"14082",159,"I found a thousand difficulties. I am an extremely unhandy man (my"
"14083",159,"schooling was over before the days of Slöjd); but most of the"
"14084",159,"requirements of a raft I met at last in some clumsy, circuitous way or"
"14085",159,"other, and this time I took care of the strength. The only"
"14086",159,"insurmountable obstacle was that I had no vessel to contain the water I"
"14087",159,"should need if I floated forth upon these untravelled seas. I would"
"14088",159,"have even tried pottery, but the island contained no clay. I used to go"
"14089",159,"moping about the island trying with all my might to solve this one last"
"14090",159,"difficulty. Sometimes I would give way to wild outbursts of rage, and"
"14091",159,"hack and splinter some unlucky tree in my intolerable vexation. But I"
"14092",159,"could think of nothing."
"14093",159,""
"14094",159,"And then came a day, a wonderful day, which I spent in ecstasy. I saw a"
"14095",159,"sail to the southwest, a small sail like that of a little schooner; and"
"14096",159,"forthwith I lit a great pile of brushwood, and stood by it in the heat"
"14097",159,"of it, and the heat of the midday sun, watching. All day I watched that"
"14098",159,"sail, eating or drinking nothing, so that my head reeled; and the"
"14099",159,"Beasts came and glared at me, and seemed to wonder, and went away. It"
"14100",159,"was still distant when night came and swallowed it up; and all night I"
"14101",159,"toiled to keep my blaze bright and high, and the eyes of the Beasts"
"14102",159,"shone out of the darkness, marvelling. In the dawn the sail was nearer,"
"14103",159,"and I saw it was the dirty lug-sail of a small boat. But it sailed"
"14104",159,"strangely. My eyes were weary with watching, and I peered and could not"
"14105",159,"believe them. Two men were in the boat, sitting low down,—one by the"
"14106",159,"bows, the other at the rudder. The head was not kept to the wind; it"
"14107",159,"yawed and fell away."
"14108",159,""
"14109",159,"As the day grew brighter, I began waving the last rag of my jacket to"
"14110",159,"them; but they did not notice me, and sat still, facing each other. I"
"14111",159,"went to the lowest point of the low headland, and gesticulated and"
"14112",159,"shouted. There was no response, and the boat kept on her aimless"
"14113",159,"course, making slowly, very slowly, for the bay. Suddenly a great white"
"14114",159,"bird flew up out of the boat, and neither of the men stirred nor"
"14115",159,"noticed it; it circled round, and then came sweeping overhead with its"
"14116",159,"strong wings outspread."
"14117",159,""
"14118",159,"Then I stopped shouting, and sat down on the headland and rested my"
"14119",159,"chin on my hands and stared. Slowly, slowly, the boat drove past"
"14120",159,"towards the west. I would have swum out to it, but something—a cold,"
"14121",159,"vague fear—kept me back. In the afternoon the tide stranded the boat,"
"14122",159,"and left it a hundred yards or so to the westward of the ruins of the"
"14123",159,"enclosure. The men in it were dead, had been dead so long that they"
"14124",159,"fell to pieces when I tilted the boat on its side and dragged them out."
"14125",159,"One had a shock of red hair, like the captain of the _Ipecacuanha_, and"
"14126",159,"a dirty white cap lay in the bottom of the boat."

"14128",159,"As I stood beside the boat, three of the Beasts came slinking out of"
"14129",159,"the bushes and sniffing towards me. One of my spasms of disgust came"
"14130",159,"upon me. I thrust the little boat down the beach and clambered on board"
"14131",159,"her. Two of the brutes were Wolf-beasts, and came forward with"
"14132",159,"quivering nostrils and glittering eyes; the third was the horrible"
"14133",159,"nondescript of bear and bull. When I saw them approaching those"
"14134",159,"wretched remains, heard them snarling at one another and caught the"
"14135",159,"gleam of their teeth, a frantic horror succeeded my repulsion. I turned"
"14136",159,"my back upon them, struck the lug and began paddling out to sea. I"
"14137",159,"could not bring myself to look behind me."
"14138",159,""
"14139",159,"I lay, however, between the reef and the island that night, and the"
"14140",159,"next morning went round to the stream and filled the empty keg aboard"
"14141",159,"with water. Then, with such patience as I could command, I collected a"
"14142",159,"quantity of fruit, and waylaid and killed two rabbits with my last"
"14143",159,"three cartridges. While I was doing this I left the boat moored to an"
"14144",159,"inward projection of the reef, for fear of the Beast People."

"14150",159,"THE MAN ALONE."

"14152",159,""
"14153",159,"In the evening I started, and drove out to sea before a gentle wind"
"14154",159,"from the southwest, slowly, steadily; and the island grew smaller and"
"14155",159,"smaller, and the lank spire of smoke dwindled to a finer and finer line"
"14156",159,"against the hot sunset. The ocean rose up around me, hiding that low,"
"14157",159,"dark patch from my eyes. The daylight, the trailing glory of the sun,"
"14158",159,"went streaming out of the sky, was drawn aside like some luminous"
"14159",159,"curtain, and at last I looked into the blue gulf of immensity which the"
"14160",159,"sunshine hides, and saw the floating hosts of the stars. The sea was"
"14161",159,"silent, the sky was silent. I was alone with the night and silence."
"14162",159,""
"14163",159,"So I drifted for three days, eating and drinking sparingly, and"
"14164",159,"meditating upon all that had happened to me,—not desiring very greatly"
"14165",159,"then to see men again. One unclean rag was about me, my hair a black"
"14166",159,"tangle: no doubt my discoverers thought me a madman."
"14167",159,""
"14168",159,"It is strange, but I felt no desire to return to mankind. I was only"
"14169",159,"glad to be quit of the foulness of the Beast People. And on the third"
"14170",159,"day I was picked up by a brig from Apia to San Francisco. Neither the"
"14171",159,"captain nor the mate would believe my story, judging that solitude and"
"14172",159,"danger had made me mad; and fearing their opinion might be that of"
"14173",159,"others, I refrained from telling my adventure further, and professed to"
"14174",159,"recall nothing that had happened to me between the loss of the _Lady"
"14175",159,"Vain_ and the time when I was picked up again,—the space of a year."
"14176",159,""
"14177",159,"I had to act with the utmost circumspection to save myself from the"
"14178",159,"suspicion of insanity. My memory of the Law, of the two dead sailors,"
"14179",159,"of the ambuscades of the darkness, of the body in the canebrake,"
"14180",159,"haunted me; and, unnatural as it seems, with my return to mankind came,"
"14181",159,"instead of that confidence and sympathy I had expected, a strange"
"14182",159,"enhancement of the uncertainty and dread I had experienced during my"
"14183",159,"stay upon the island. No one would believe me; I was almost as queer to"
"14184",159,"men as I had been to the Beast People. I may have caught something of"
"14185",159,"the natural wildness of my companions. They say that terror is a"
"14186",159,"disease, and anyhow I can witness that for several years now a restless"
"14187",159,"fear has dwelt in my mind,—such a restless fear as a half-tamed lion"
"14188",159,"cub may feel."
"14189",159,""
"14190",159,"My trouble took the strangest form. I could not persuade myself that"
"14191",159,"the men and women I met were not also another Beast People, animals"
"14192",159,"half wrought into the outward image of human souls, and that they would"
"14193",159,"presently begin to revert,—to show first this bestial mark and then"
"14194",159,"that. But I have confided my case to a strangely able man,—a man who"
"14195",159,"had known Moreau, and seemed half to credit my story; a mental"
"14196",159,"specialist,—and he has helped me mightily, though I do not expect that"
"14197",159,"the terror of that island will ever altogether leave me. At most times"
"14198",159,"it lies far in the back of my mind, a mere distant cloud, a memory, and"
"14199",159,"a faint distrust; but there are times when the little cloud spreads"
"14200",159,"until it obscures the whole sky. Then I look about me at my fellow-men;"
"14201",159,"and I go in fear. I see faces, keen and bright; others dull or"
"14202",159,"dangerous; others, unsteady, insincere,—none that have the calm"
"14203",159,"authority of a reasonable soul. I feel as though the animal was surging"
"14204",159,"up through them; that presently the degradation of the Islanders will"
"14205",159,"be played over again on a larger scale. I know this is an illusion;"
"14206",159,"that these seeming men and women about me are indeed men and women,—men"
"14207",159,"and women for ever, perfectly reasonable creatures, full of human"
"14208",159,"desires and tender solicitude, emancipated from instinct and the slaves"
"14209",159,"of no fantastic Law,—beings altogether different from the Beast Folk."
"14210",159,"Yet I shrink from them, from their curious glances, their inquiries and"
"14211",159,"assistance, and long to be away from them and alone. For that reason I"
"14212",159,"live near the broad free downland, and can escape thither when this"
"14213",159,"shadow is over my soul; and very sweet is the empty downland then,"
"14214",159,"under the wind-swept sky."
"14215",159,""
"14216",159,"When I lived in London the horror was well-nigh insupportable. I could"
"14217",159,"not get away from men: their voices came through windows; locked doors"
"14218",159,"were flimsy safeguards. I would go out into the streets to fight with"
"14219",159,"my delusion, and prowling women would mew after me; furtive, craving"
"14220",159,"men glance jealously at me; weary, pale workers go coughing by me with"
"14221",159,"tired eyes and eager paces, like wounded deer dripping blood; old"
"14222",159,"people, bent and dull, pass murmuring to themselves; and, all"
"14223",159,"unheeding, a ragged tail of gibing children. Then I would turn aside"
"14224",159,"into some chapel,—and even there, such was my disturbance, it seemed"
"14225",159,"that the preacher gibbered “Big Thinks,” even as the Ape-man had done;"
"14226",159,"or into some library, and there the intent faces over the books seemed"
"14227",159,"but patient creatures waiting for prey. Particularly nauseous were the"
"14228",159,"blank, expressionless faces of people in trains and omnibuses; they"
"14229",159,"seemed no more my fellow-creatures than dead bodies would be, so that I"
"14230",159,"did not dare to travel unless I was assured of being alone. And even it"
"14231",159,"seemed that I too was not a reasonable creature, but only an animal"
"14232",159,"tormented with some strange disorder in its brain which sent it to"
"14233",159,"wander alone, like a sheep stricken with gid."
"14234",159,""
"14235",159,"This is a mood, however, that comes to me now, I thank God, more"
"14236",159,"rarely. I have withdrawn myself from the confusion of cities and"
"14237",159,"multitudes, and spend my days surrounded by wise books,—bright windows"
"14238",159,"in this life of ours, lit by the shining souls of men. I see few"
"14239",159,"strangers, and have but a small household. My days I devote to reading"
"14240",159,"and to experiments in chemistry, and I spend many of the clear nights"
"14241",159,"in the study of astronomy. There is—though I do not know how there is"
"14242",159,"or why there is—a sense of infinite peace and protection in the"
"14243",159,"glittering hosts of heaven. There it must be, I think, in the vast and"
"14244",159,"eternal laws of matter, and not in the daily cares and sins and"
"14245",159,"troubles of men, that whatever is more than animal within us must find"
"14246",159,"its solace and its hope. I _hope_, or I could not live."

"14313",5230,""
"14314",5230,""
"14315",5230,"The stranger came early in February, one wintry day, through a biting"
"14316",5230,"wind and a driving snow, the last snowfall of the year, over the down,"
"14317",5230,"walking from Bramblehurst railway station, and carrying a little black"
"14318",5230,"portmanteau in his thickly gloved hand. He was wrapped up from head to"
"14319",5230,"foot, and the brim of his soft felt hat hid every inch of his face but"
"14320",5230,"the shiny tip of his nose; the snow had piled itself against his"
"14321",5230,"shoulders and chest, and added a white crest to the burden he carried."
"14322",5230,"He staggered into the “Coach and Horses” more dead than alive, and"
"14323",5230,"flung his portmanteau down. “A fire,” he cried, “in the name of human"
"14324",5230,"charity! A room and a fire!” He stamped and shook the snow from off"
"14325",5230,"himself in the bar, and followed Mrs. Hall into her guest parlour to"
"14326",5230,"strike his bargain. And with that much introduction, that and a couple"
"14327",5230,"of sovereigns flung upon the table, he took up his quarters in the inn."
"14328",5230,""
"14329",5230,"Mrs. Hall lit the fire and left him there while she went to prepare him"
"14330",5230,"a meal with her own hands. A guest to stop at Iping in the wintertime"
"14331",5230,"was an unheard-of piece of luck, let alone a guest who was no"
"14332",5230,"“haggler,” and she was resolved to show herself worthy of her good"
"14333",5230,"fortune. As soon as the bacon was well under way, and Millie, her"
"14334",5230,"lymphatic maid, had been brisked up a bit by a few deftly chosen"
"14335",5230,"expressions of contempt, she carried the cloth, plates, and glasses"
"14336",5230,"into the parlour and began to lay them with the utmost _éclat_."
"14337",5230,"Although the fire was burning up briskly, she was surprised to see that"
"14338",5230,"her visitor still wore his hat and coat, standing with his back to her"
"14339",5230,"and staring out of the window at the falling snow in the yard. His"
"14340",5230,"gloved hands were clasped behind him, and he seemed to be lost in"
"14341",5230,"thought. She noticed that the melting snow that still sprinkled his"
"14342",5230,"shoulders dripped upon her carpet. “Can I take your hat and coat, sir?”"
"14343",5230,"she said, “and give them a good dry in the kitchen?”"
"14344",5230,""
"14345",5230,"“No,” he said without turning."
"14346",5230,""
"14347",5230,"She was not sure she had heard him, and was about to repeat her"
"14348",5230,"question."
"14349",5230,""
"14350",5230,"He turned his head and looked at her over his shoulder. “I prefer to"
"14351",5230,"keep them on,” he said with emphasis, and she noticed that he wore big"
"14352",5230,"blue spectacles with sidelights, and had a bush side-whisker over his"
"14353",5230,"coat-collar that completely hid his cheeks and face."
"14354",5230,""
"14355",5230,"“Very well, sir,” she said. “_As_ you like. In a bit the room will be"
"14356",5230,"warmer.”"
"14357",5230,""
"14358",5230,"He made no answer, and had turned his face away from her again, and"
"14359",5230,"Mrs. Hall, feeling that her conversational advances were ill-timed,"
"14360",5230,"laid the rest of the table things in a quick staccato and whisked out"
"14361",5230,"of the room. When she returned he was still standing there, like a man"
"14362",5230,"of stone, his back hunched, his collar turned up, his dripping hat-brim"
"14363",5230,"turned down, hiding his face and ears completely. She put down the eggs"
"14364",5230,"and bacon with considerable emphasis, and called rather than said to"
"14365",5230,"him, “Your lunch is served, sir.”"
"14366",5230,""
"14367",5230,"“Thank you,” he said at the same time, and did not stir until she was"
"14368",5230,"closing the door. Then he swung round and approached the table with a"
"14369",5230,"certain eager quickness."
"14370",5230,""
"14371",5230,"As she went behind the bar to the kitchen she heard a sound repeated at"
"14372",5230,"regular intervals. Chirk, chirk, chirk, it went, the sound of a spoon"
"14373",5230,"being rapidly whisked round a basin. “That girl!” she said. “There! I"
"14374",5230,"clean forgot it. It’s her being so long!” And while she herself"
"14375",5230,"finished mixing the mustard, she gave Millie a few verbal stabs for her"
"14376",5230,"excessive slowness. She had cooked the ham and eggs, laid the table,"
"14377",5230,"and done everything, while Millie (help indeed!) had only succeeded in"
"14378",5230,"delaying the mustard. And him a new guest and wanting to stay! Then she"
"14379",5230,"filled the mustard pot, and, putting it with a certain stateliness upon"
"14380",5230,"a gold and black tea-tray, carried it into the parlour."
"14381",5230,""
"14382",5230,"She rapped and entered promptly. As she did so her visitor moved"
"14383",5230,"quickly, so that she got but a glimpse of a white object disappearing"
"14384",5230,"behind the table. It would seem he was picking something from the"
"14385",5230,"floor. She rapped down the mustard pot on the table, and then she"
"14386",5230,"noticed the overcoat and hat had been taken off and put over a chair in"
"14387",5230,"front of the fire, and a pair of wet boots threatened rust to her steel"
"14388",5230,"fender. She went to these things resolutely. “I suppose I may have them"
"14389",5230,"to dry now,” she said in a voice that brooked no denial."
"14390",5230,""
"14391",5230,"“Leave the hat,” said her visitor, in a muffled voice, and turning she"
"14392",5230,"saw he had raised his head and was sitting and looking at her."
"14393",5230,""
"14394",5230,"For a moment she stood gaping at him, too surprised to speak."
"14395",5230,""
"14396",5230,"He held a white cloth—it was a serviette he had brought with him—over"
"14397",5230,"the lower part of his face, so that his mouth and jaws were completely"
"14398",5230,"hidden, and that was the reason of his muffled voice. But it was not"
"14399",5230,"that which startled Mrs. Hall. It was the fact that all his forehead"
"14400",5230,"above his blue glasses was covered by a white bandage, and that another"
"14401",5230,"covered his ears, leaving not a scrap of his face exposed excepting"
"14402",5230,"only his pink, peaked nose. It was bright, pink, and shiny just as it"
"14403",5230,"had been at first. He wore a dark-brown velvet jacket with a high,"
"14404",5230,"black, linen-lined collar turned up about his neck. The thick black"
"14405",5230,"hair, escaping as it could below and between the cross bandages,"
"14406",5230,"projected in curious tails and horns, giving him the strangest"
"14407",5230,"appearance conceivable. This muffled and bandaged head was so unlike"
"14408",5230,"what she had anticipated, that for a moment she was rigid."
"14409",5230,""
"14410",5230,"He did not remove the serviette, but remained holding it, as she saw"
"14411",5230,"now, with a brown gloved hand, and regarding her with his inscrutable"
"14412",5230,"blue glasses. “Leave the hat,” he said, speaking very distinctly"
"14413",5230,"through the white cloth."
"14414",5230,""
"14415",5230,"Her nerves began to recover from the shock they had received. She"
"14416",5230,"placed the hat on the chair again by the fire. “I didn’t know, sir,”"
"14417",5230,"she began, “that—” and she stopped embarrassed."
"14418",5230,""
"14419",5230,"“Thank you,” he said drily, glancing from her to the door and then at"
"14420",5230,"her again."
"14421",5230,""
"14422",5230,"“I’ll have them nicely dried, sir, at once,” she said, and carried his"
"14423",5230,"clothes out of the room. She glanced at his white-swathed head and blue"
"14424",5230,"goggles again as she was going out of the door; but his napkin was"
"14425",5230,"still in front of his face. She shivered a little as she closed the"
"14426",5230,"door behind her, and her face was eloquent of her surprise and"
"14427",5230,"perplexity. “I _never_,” she whispered. “There!” She went quite softly"
"14428",5230,"to the kitchen, and was too preoccupied to ask Millie what she was"
"14429",5230,"messing about with _now_, when she got there."
"14430",5230,""
"14431",5230,"The visitor sat and listened to her retreating feet. He glanced"
"14432",5230,"inquiringly at the window before he removed his serviette, and resumed"
"14433",5230,"his meal. He took a mouthful, glanced suspiciously at the window, took"
"14434",5230,"another mouthful, then rose and, taking the serviette in his hand,"
"14435",5230,"walked across the room and pulled the blind down to the top of the"
"14436",5230,"white muslin that obscured the lower panes. This left the room in a"
"14437",5230,"twilight. This done, he returned with an easier air to the table and"
"14438",5230,"his meal."
"14439",5230,""
"14440",5230,"“The poor soul’s had an accident or an op’ration or somethin’,” said"
"14441",5230,"Mrs. Hall. “What a turn them bandages did give me, to be sure!”"
"14442",5230,""
"14443",5230,"She put on some more coal, unfolded the clothes-horse, and extended the"
"14444",5230,"traveller’s coat upon this. “And they goggles! Why, he looked more like"
"14445",5230,"a divin’ helmet than a human man!” She hung his muffler on a corner of"
"14446",5230,"the horse. “And holding that handkerchief over his mouth all the time."
"14447",5230,"Talkin’ through it! ... Perhaps his mouth was hurt too—maybe.”"
"14448",5230,""
"14449",5230,"She turned round, as one who suddenly remembers. “Bless my soul alive!”"
"14450",5230,"she said, going off at a tangent; “ain’t you done them taters _yet_,"
"14451",5230,"Millie?”"
"14452",5230,""
"14453",5230,"When Mrs. Hall went to clear away the stranger’s lunch, her idea that"
"14454",5230,"his mouth must also have been cut or disfigured in the accident she"
"14455",5230,"supposed him to have suffered, was confirmed, for he was smoking a"
"14456",5230,"pipe, and all the time that she was in the room he never loosened the"
"14457",5230,"silk muffler he had wrapped round the lower part of his face to put the"
"14458",5230,"mouthpiece to his lips. Yet it was not forgetfulness, for she saw he"
"14459",5230,"glanced at it as it smouldered out. He sat in the corner with his back"
"14460",5230,"to the window-blind and spoke now, having eaten and drunk and being"
"14461",5230,"comfortably warmed through, with less aggressive brevity than before."
"14462",5230,"The reflection of the fire lent a kind of red animation to his big"
"14463",5230,"spectacles they had lacked hitherto."
"14464",5230,""
"14465",5230,"“I have some luggage,” he said, “at Bramblehurst station,” and he asked"
"14466",5230,"her how he could have it sent. He bowed his bandaged head quite"
"14467",5230,"politely in acknowledgment of her explanation. “To-morrow?” he said."
"14468",5230,"“There is no speedier delivery?” and seemed quite disappointed when she"
"14469",5230,"answered, “No.” Was she quite sure? No man with a trap who would go"
"14470",5230,"over?"
"14471",5230,""
"14472",5230,"Mrs. Hall, nothing loath, answered his questions and developed a"
"14473",5230,"conversation. “It’s a steep road by the down, sir,” she said in answer"
"14474",5230,"to the question about a trap; and then, snatching at an opening, said,"
"14475",5230,"“It was there a carriage was upsettled, a year ago and more. A"
"14476",5230,"gentleman killed, besides his coachman. Accidents, sir, happen in a"
"14477",5230,"moment, don’t they?”"
"14478",5230,""
"14479",5230,"But the visitor was not to be drawn so easily. “They do,” he said"
"14480",5230,"through his muffler, eyeing her quietly through his impenetrable"
"14481",5230,"glasses."
"14482",5230,""
"14483",5230,"“But they take long enough to get well, don’t they? ... There was my"
"14484",5230,"sister’s son, Tom, jest cut his arm with a scythe, tumbled on it in the"
"14485",5230,"’ayfield, and, bless me! he was three months tied up sir. You’d hardly"
"14486",5230,"believe it. It’s regular given me a dread of a scythe, sir.”"
"14487",5230,""
"14488",5230,"“I can quite understand that,” said the visitor."
"14489",5230,""
"14490",5230,"“He was afraid, one time, that he’d have to have an op’ration—he was"
"14491",5230,"that bad, sir.”"
"14492",5230,""
"14493",5230,"The visitor laughed abruptly, a bark of a laugh that he seemed to bite"
"14494",5230,"and kill in his mouth. “_Was_ he?” he said."
"14495",5230,""
"14496",5230,"“He was, sir. And no laughing matter to them as had the doing for him,"
"14497",5230,"as I had—my sister being took up with her little ones so much. There"
"14498",5230,"was bandages to do, sir, and bandages to undo. So that if I may make so"
"14499",5230,"bold as to say it, sir—”"
"14500",5230,""
"14501",5230,"“Will you get me some matches?” said the visitor, quite abruptly. “My"
"14502",5230,"pipe is out.”"
"14503",5230,""
"14504",5230,"Mrs. Hall was pulled up suddenly. It was certainly rude of him, after"
"14505",5230,"telling him all she had done. She gasped at him for a moment, and"
"14506",5230,"remembered the two sovereigns. She went for the matches."
"14507",5230,""
"14508",5230,"“Thanks,” he said concisely, as she put them down, and turned his"
"14509",5230,"shoulder upon her and stared out of the window again. It was altogether"
"14510",5230,"too discouraging. Evidently he was sensitive on the topic of operations"
"14511",5230,"and bandages. She did not “make so bold as to say,” however, after all."
"14512",5230,"But his snubbing way had irritated her, and Millie had a hot time of it"
"14513",5230,"that afternoon."
"14514",5230,""
"14515",5230,"The visitor remained in the parlour until four o’clock, without giving"
"14516",5230,"the ghost of an excuse for an intrusion. For the most part he was quite"
"14517",5230,"still during that time; it would seem he sat in the growing darkness"
"14518",5230,"smoking in the firelight—perhaps dozing."
"14519",5230,""
"14520",5230,"Once or twice a curious listener might have heard him at the coals, and"
"14521",5230,"for the space of five minutes he was audible pacing the room. He seemed"
"14522",5230,"to be talking to himself. Then the armchair creaked as he sat down"
"14523",5230,"again."

"14530",5230,""
"14531",5230,""
"14532",5230,"At four o’clock, when it was fairly dark and Mrs. Hall was screwing up"
"14533",5230,"her courage to go in and ask her visitor if he would take some tea,"
"14534",5230,"Teddy Henfrey, the clock-jobber, came into the bar. “My sakes! Mrs."
"14535",5230,"Hall,” said he, “but this is terrible weather for thin boots!” The snow"
"14536",5230,"outside was falling faster."
"14537",5230,""
"14538",5230,"Mrs. Hall agreed, and then noticed he had his bag with him. “Now you’re"
"14539",5230,"here, Mr. Teddy,” said she, “I’d be glad if you’d give th’ old clock in"
"14540",5230,"the parlour a bit of a look. ’Tis going, and it strikes well and"
"14541",5230,"hearty; but the hour-hand won’t do nuthin’ but point at six.”"
"14542",5230,""
"14543",5230,"And leading the way, she went across to the parlour door and rapped and"
"14544",5230,"entered."
"14545",5230,""
"14546",5230,"Her visitor, she saw as she opened the door, was seated in the armchair"
"14547",5230,"before the fire, dozing it would seem, with his bandaged head drooping"
"14548",5230,"on one side. The only light in the room was the red glow from the"
"14549",5230,"fire—which lit his eyes like adverse railway signals, but left his"
"14550",5230,"downcast face in darkness—and the scanty vestiges of the day that came"
"14551",5230,"in through the open door. Everything was ruddy, shadowy, and indistinct"
"14552",5230,"to her, the more so since she had just been lighting the bar lamp, and"
"14553",5230,"her eyes were dazzled. But for a second it seemed to her that the man"
"14554",5230,"she looked at had an enormous mouth wide open—a vast and incredible"
"14555",5230,"mouth that swallowed the whole of the lower portion of his face. It was"
"14556",5230,"the sensation of a moment: the white-bound head, the monstrous goggle"
"14557",5230,"eyes, and this huge yawn below it. Then he stirred, started up in his"
"14558",5230,"chair, put up his hand. She opened the door wide, so that the room was"
"14559",5230,"lighter, and she saw him more clearly, with the muffler held up to his"
"14560",5230,"face just as she had seen him hold the serviette before. The shadows,"
"14561",5230,"she fancied, had tricked her."
"14562",5230,""
"14563",5230,"“Would you mind, sir, this man a-coming to look at the clock, sir?” she"
"14564",5230,"said, recovering from the momentary shock."
"14565",5230,""
"14566",5230,"“Look at the clock?” he said, staring round in a drowsy manner, and"
"14567",5230,"speaking over his hand, and then, getting more fully awake,"
"14568",5230,"“certainly.”"
"14569",5230,""
"14570",5230,"Mrs. Hall went away to get a lamp, and he rose and stretched himself."
"14571",5230,"Then came the light, and Mr. Teddy Henfrey, entering, was confronted by"
"14572",5230,"this bandaged person. He was, he says, “taken aback.”"
"14573",5230,""
"14574",5230,"“Good afternoon,” said the stranger, regarding him—as Mr. Henfrey says,"
"14575",5230,"with a vivid sense of the dark spectacles—“like a lobster.”"
"14576",5230,""
"14577",5230,"“I hope,” said Mr. Henfrey, “that it’s no intrusion.”"
"14578",5230,""
"14579",5230,"“None whatever,” said the stranger. “Though, I understand,” he said"
"14580",5230,"turning to Mrs. Hall, “that this room is really to be mine for my own"
"14581",5230,"private use.”"
"14582",5230,""
"14583",5230,"“I thought, sir,” said Mrs. Hall, “you’d prefer the clock—”"
"14584",5230,""
"14585",5230,"“Certainly,” said the stranger, “certainly—but, as a rule, I like to be"
"14586",5230,"alone and undisturbed."
"14587",5230,""
"14588",5230,"“But I’m really glad to have the clock seen to,” he said, seeing a"
"14589",5230,"certain hesitation in Mr. Henfrey’s manner. “Very glad.” Mr. Henfrey"
"14590",5230,"had intended to apologise and withdraw, but this anticipation reassured"
"14591",5230,"him. The stranger turned round with his back to the fireplace and put"
"14592",5230,"his hands behind his back. “And presently,” he said, “when the"
"14593",5230,"clock-mending is over, I think I should like to have some tea. But not"
"14594",5230,"till the clock-mending is over.”"
"14595",5230,""
"14596",5230,"Mrs. Hall was about to leave the room—she made no conversational"
"14597",5230,"advances this time, because she did not want to be snubbed in front of"
"14598",5230,"Mr. Henfrey—when her visitor asked her if she had made any arrangements"
"14599",5230,"about his boxes at Bramblehurst. She told him she had mentioned the"
"14600",5230,"matter to the postman, and that the carrier could bring them over on"
"14601",5230,"the morrow. “You are certain that is the earliest?” he said."
"14602",5230,""
"14603",5230,"She was certain, with a marked coldness."
"14604",5230,""
"14605",5230,"“I should explain,” he added, “what I was really too cold and fatigued"
"14606",5230,"to do before, that I am an experimental investigator.”"
"14607",5230,""
"14608",5230,"“Indeed, sir,” said Mrs. Hall, much impressed."
"14609",5230,""
"14610",5230,"“And my baggage contains apparatus and appliances.”"
"14611",5230,""
"14612",5230,"“Very useful things indeed they are, sir,” said Mrs. Hall."
"14613",5230,""
"14614",5230,"“And I’m very naturally anxious to get on with my inquiries.”"
"14615",5230,""
"14616",5230,"“Of course, sir.”"
"14617",5230,""
"14618",5230,"“My reason for coming to Iping,” he proceeded, with a certain"
"14619",5230,"deliberation of manner, “was ... a desire for solitude. I do not wish"
"14620",5230,"to be disturbed in my work. In addition to my work, an accident—”"
"14621",5230,""
"14622",5230,"“I thought as much,” said Mrs. Hall to herself."
"14623",5230,""
"14624",5230,"“—necessitates a certain retirement. My eyes—are sometimes so weak and"
"14625",5230,"painful that I have to shut myself up in the dark for hours together."
"14626",5230,"Lock myself up. Sometimes—now and then. Not at present, certainly. At"
"14627",5230,"such times the slightest disturbance, the entry of a stranger into the"
"14628",5230,"room, is a source of excruciating annoyance to me—it is well these"
"14629",5230,"things should be understood.”"
"14630",5230,""
"14631",5230,"“Certainly, sir,” said Mrs. Hall. “And if I might make so bold as to"
"14632",5230,"ask—”"
"14633",5230,""
"14634",5230,"“That I think, is all,” said the stranger, with that quietly"
"14635",5230,"irresistible air of finality he could assume at will. Mrs. Hall"
"14636",5230,"reserved her question and sympathy for a better occasion."
"14637",5230,""
"14638",5230,"After Mrs. Hall had left the room, he remained standing in front of the"
"14639",5230,"fire, glaring, so Mr. Henfrey puts it, at the clock-mending. Mr."
"14640",5230,"Henfrey not only took off the hands of the clock, and the face, but"
"14641",5230,"extracted the works; and he tried to work in as slow and quiet and"
"14642",5230,"unassuming a manner as possible. He worked with the lamp close to him,"
"14643",5230,"and the green shade threw a brilliant light upon his hands, and upon"
"14644",5230,"the frame and wheels, and left the rest of the room shadowy. When he"
"14645",5230,"looked up, coloured patches swam in his eyes. Being constitutionally of"
"14646",5230,"a curious nature, he had removed the works—a quite unnecessary"
"14647",5230,"proceeding—with the idea of delaying his departure and perhaps falling"
"14648",5230,"into conversation with the stranger. But the stranger stood there,"
"14649",5230,"perfectly silent and still. So still, it got on Henfrey’s nerves. He"
"14650",5230,"felt alone in the room and looked up, and there, grey and dim, was the"
"14651",5230,"bandaged head and huge blue lenses staring fixedly, with a mist of"
"14652",5230,"green spots drifting in front of them. It was so uncanny to Henfrey"
"14653",5230,"that for a minute they remained staring blankly at one another. Then"
"14654",5230,"Henfrey looked down again. Very uncomfortable position! One would like"
"14655",5230,"to say something. Should he remark that the weather was very cold for"
"14656",5230,"the time of year?"
"14657",5230,""
"14658",5230,"He looked up as if to take aim with that introductory shot. “The"
"14659",5230,"weather—” he began."
"14660",5230,""
"14661",5230,"“Why don’t you finish and go?” said the rigid figure, evidently in a"
"14662",5230,"state of painfully suppressed rage. “All you’ve got to do is to fix the"
"14663",5230,"hour-hand on its axle. You’re simply humbugging—”"
"14664",5230,""
"14665",5230,"“Certainly, sir—one minute more. I overlooked—” and Mr. Henfrey"
"14666",5230,"finished and went."
"14667",5230,""
"14668",5230,"But he went feeling excessively annoyed. “Damn it!” said Mr. Henfrey to"
"14669",5230,"himself, trudging down the village through the thawing snow; “a man"
"14670",5230,"must do a clock at times, surely.”"
"14671",5230,""
"14672",5230,"And again, “Can’t a man look at you?—Ugly!”"
"14673",5230,""
"14674",5230,"And yet again, “Seemingly not. If the police was wanting you you"
"14675",5230,"couldn’t be more wropped and bandaged.”"
"14676",5230,""
"14677",5230,"At Gleeson’s corner he saw Hall, who had recently married the"
"14678",5230,"stranger’s hostess at the “Coach and Horses,” and who now drove the"
"14679",5230,"Iping conveyance, when occasional people required it, to Sidderbridge"
"14680",5230,"Junction, coming towards him on his return from that place. Hall had"
"14681",5230,"evidently been “stopping a bit” at Sidderbridge, to judge by his"
"14682",5230,"driving. “’Ow do, Teddy?” he said, passing."
"14683",5230,""
"14684",5230,"“You got a rum un up home!” said Teddy."
"14685",5230,""
"14686",5230,"Hall very sociably pulled up. “What’s that?” he asked."
"14687",5230,""
"14688",5230,"“Rum-looking customer stopping at the ‘Coach and Horses,’” said Teddy."
"14689",5230,"“My sakes!”"
"14690",5230,""
"14691",5230,"And he proceeded to give Hall a vivid description of his grotesque"
"14692",5230,"guest. “Looks a bit like a disguise, don’t it? I’d like to see a man’s"
"14693",5230,"face if I had him stopping in _my_ place,” said Henfrey. “But women are"
"14694",5230,"that trustful—where strangers are concerned. He’s took your rooms and"
"14695",5230,"he ain’t even given a name, Hall.”"
"14696",5230,""
"14697",5230,"“You don’t say so!” said Hall, who was a man of sluggish apprehension."
"14698",5230,""
"14699",5230,"“Yes,” said Teddy. “By the week. Whatever he is, you can’t get rid of"
"14700",5230,"him under the week. And he’s got a lot of luggage coming to-morrow, so"
"14701",5230,"he says. Let’s hope it won’t be stones in boxes, Hall.”"
"14702",5230,""
"14703",5230,"He told Hall how his aunt at Hastings had been swindled by a stranger"
"14704",5230,"with empty portmanteaux. Altogether he left Hall vaguely suspicious."
"14705",5230,"“Get up, old girl,” said Hall. “I s’pose I must see ’bout this.”"
"14706",5230,""
"14707",5230,"Teddy trudged on his way with his mind considerably relieved."
"14708",5230,""
"14709",5230,"Instead of “seeing ’bout it,” however, Hall on his return was severely"
"14710",5230,"rated by his wife on the length of time he had spent in Sidderbridge,"
"14711",5230,"and his mild inquiries were answered snappishly and in a manner not to"
"14712",5230,"the point. But the seed of suspicion Teddy had sown germinated in the"
"14713",5230,"mind of Mr. Hall in spite of these discouragements. “You wim’ don’t"
"14714",5230,"know everything,” said Mr. Hall, resolved to ascertain more about the"
"14715",5230,"personality of his guest at the earliest possible opportunity. And"
"14716",5230,"after the stranger had gone to bed, which he did about half-past nine,"
"14717",5230,"Mr. Hall went very aggressively into the parlour and looked very hard"
"14718",5230,"at his wife’s furniture, just to show that the stranger wasn’t master"
"14719",5230,"there, and scrutinised closely and a little contemptuously a sheet of"
"14720",5230,"mathematical computations the stranger had left. When retiring for the"
"14721",5230,"night he instructed Mrs. Hall to look very closely at the stranger’s"
"14722",5230,"luggage when it came next day."
"14723",5230,""
"14724",5230,"“You mind your own business, Hall,” said Mrs. Hall, “and I’ll mind"
"14725",5230,"mine.”"
"14726",5230,""
"14727",5230,"She was all the more inclined to snap at Hall because the stranger was"
"14728",5230,"undoubtedly an unusually strange sort of stranger, and she was by no"
"14729",5230,"means assured about him in her own mind. In the middle of the night she"
"14730",5230,"woke up dreaming of huge white heads like turnips, that came trailing"
"14731",5230,"after her, at the end of interminable necks, and with vast black eyes."
"14732",5230,"But being a sensible woman, she subdued her terrors and turned over and"
"14733",5230,"went to sleep again."

"14740",5230,""
"14741",5230,""
"14742",5230,"So it was that on the twenty-ninth day of February, at the beginning of"
"14743",5230,"the thaw, this singular person fell out of infinity into Iping village."
"14744",5230,"Next day his luggage arrived through the slush—and very remarkable"
"14745",5230,"luggage it was. There were a couple of trunks indeed, such as a"
"14746",5230,"rational man might need, but in addition there were a box of books—big,"
"14747",5230,"fat books, of which some were just in an incomprehensible"
"14748",5230,"handwriting—and a dozen or more crates, boxes, and cases, containing"
"14749",5230,"objects packed in straw, as it seemed to Hall, tugging with a casual"
"14750",5230,"curiosity at the straw—glass bottles. The stranger, muffled in hat,"
"14751",5230,"coat, gloves, and wrapper, came out impatiently to meet Fearenside’s"
"14752",5230,"cart, while Hall was having a word or so of gossip preparatory to"
"14753",5230,"helping bring them in. Out he came, not noticing Fearenside’s dog, who"
"14754",5230,"was sniffing in a _dilettante_ spirit at Hall’s legs. “Come along with"
"14755",5230,"those boxes,” he said. “I’ve been waiting long enough.”"
"14756",5230,""
"14757",5230,"And he came down the steps towards the tail of the cart as if to lay"
"14758",5230,"hands on the smaller crate."

"14760",5230,"No sooner had Fearenside’s dog caught sight of him, however, than it"
"14761",5230,"began to bristle and growl savagely, and when he rushed down the steps"
"14762",5230,"it gave an undecided hop, and then sprang straight at his hand. “Whup!”"
"14763",5230,"cried Hall, jumping back, for he was no hero with dogs, and Fearenside"
"14764",5230,"howled, “Lie down!” and snatched his whip."

"14766",5230,"They saw the dog’s teeth had slipped the hand, heard a kick, saw the"

"14768",5230,"heard the rip of his trousering. Then the finer end of Fearenside’s"
"14769",5230,"whip reached his property, and the dog, yelping with dismay, retreated"
"14770",5230,"under the wheels of the waggon. It was all the business of a swift"
"14771",5230,"half-minute. No one spoke, everyone shouted. The stranger glanced"
"14772",5230,"swiftly at his torn glove and at his leg, made as if he would stoop to"
"14773",5230,"the latter, then turned and rushed swiftly up the steps into the inn."

"14785",5230,"He went straight upstairs, and the stranger’s door being ajar, he"

"14787",5230,"naturally sympathetic turn of mind."
"14788",5230,""
"14789",5230,"The blind was down and the room dim. He caught a glimpse of a most"
"14790",5230,"singular thing, what seemed a handless arm waving towards him, and a"
"14791",5230,"face of three huge indeterminate spots on white, very like the face of"
"14792",5230,"a pale pansy. Then he was struck violently in the chest, hurled back,"
"14793",5230,"and the door slammed in his face and locked. It was so rapid that it"
"14794",5230,"gave him no time to observe. A waving of indecipherable shapes, a blow,"
"14795",5230,"and a concussion. There he stood on the dark little landing, wondering"
"14796",5230,"what it might be that he had seen."

"14798",5230,"A couple of minutes after, he rejoined the little group that had formed"

"14800",5230,"all over again for the second time; there was Mrs. Hall saying his dog"
"14801",5230,"didn’t have no business to bite her guests; there was Huxter, the"
"14802",5230,"general dealer from over the road, interrogative; and Sandy Wadgers"
"14803",5230,"from the forge, judicial; besides women and children, all of them"
"14804",5230,"saying fatuities: “Wouldn’t let en bite _me_, I knows”; “’Tasn’t right"

"14807",5230,"Mr. Hall, staring at them from the steps and listening, found it"
"14808",5230,"incredible that he had seen anything so very remarkable happen"

"14836",5230,"carried into the parlour, the stranger flung himself upon it with"
"14837",5230,"extraordinary eagerness, and began to unpack it, scattering the straw"
"14838",5230,"with an utter disregard of Mrs. Hall’s carpet. And from it he began to"
"14839",5230,"produce bottles—little fat bottles containing powders, small and"
"14840",5230,"slender bottles containing coloured and white fluids, fluted blue"
"14841",5230,"bottles labeled Poison, bottles with round bodies and slender necks,"
"14842",5230,"large green-glass bottles, large white-glass bottles, bottles with"

"14844",5230,"with bungs, bottles with wooden caps, wine bottles, salad-oil"
"14845",5230,"bottles—putting them in rows on the chiffonnier, on the mantel, on the"
"14846",5230,"table under the window, round the floor, on the bookshelf—everywhere."
"14847",5230,"The chemist’s shop in Bramblehurst could not boast half so many. Quite"
"14848",5230,"a sight it was. Crate after crate yielded bottles, until all six were"
"14849",5230,"empty and the table high with straw; the only things that came out of"

"14861",5230,"put the tray on the table, with some little emphasis perhaps, seeing"
"14862",5230,"the state that the floor was in. Then he half turned his head and"
"14863",5230,"immediately turned it away again. But she saw he had removed his"
"14864",5230,"glasses; they were beside him on the table, and it seemed to her that"
"14865",5230,"his eye sockets were extraordinarily hollow. He put on his spectacles"
"14866",5230,"again, and then turned and faced her. She was about to complain of the"

"14903",5230,"had been hit, and the smash of a bottle flung violently down, and then"
"14904",5230,"a rapid pacing athwart the room. Fearing “something was the matter,”"

"14949",5230,"CHAPTER IV."
"14950",5230,"MR. CUSS INTERVIEWS THE STRANGER"
"14951",5230,""
"14952",5230,""
"14953",5230,"I have told the circumstances of the stranger’s arrival in Iping with a"
"14954",5230,"certain fulness of detail, in order that the curious impression he"
"14955",5230,"created may be understood by the reader. But excepting two odd"
"14956",5230,"incidents, the circumstances of his stay until the extraordinary day of"
"14957",5230,"the club festival may be passed over very cursorily. There were a"
"14958",5230,"number of skirmishes with Mrs. Hall on matters of domestic discipline,"
"14959",5230,"but in every case until late April, when the first signs of penury"
"14960",5230,"began, he over-rode her by the easy expedient of an extra payment. Hall"
"14961",5230,"did not like him, and whenever he dared he talked of the advisability"
"14962",5230,"of getting rid of him; but he showed his dislike chiefly by concealing"
"14963",5230,"it ostentatiously, and avoiding his visitor as much as possible. “Wait"
"14964",5230,"till the summer,” said Mrs. Hall sagely, “when the artisks are"
"14965",5230,"beginning to come. Then we’ll see. He may be a bit overbearing, but"
"14966",5230,"bills settled punctual is bills settled punctual, whatever you’d like"
"14967",5230,"to say.”"
"14968",5230,""
"14969",5230,"The stranger did not go to church, and indeed made no difference"
"14970",5230,"between Sunday and the irreligious days, even in costume. He worked, as"
"14971",5230,"Mrs. Hall thought, very fitfully. Some days he would come down early"
"14972",5230,"and be continuously busy. On others he would rise late, pace his room,"
"14973",5230,"fretting audibly for hours together, smoke, sleep in the armchair by"
"14974",5230,"the fire. Communication with the world beyond the village he had none."
"14975",5230,"His temper continued very uncertain; for the most part his manner was"
"14976",5230,"that of a man suffering under almost unendurable provocation, and once"
"14977",5230,"or twice things were snapped, torn, crushed, or broken in spasmodic"
"14978",5230,"gusts of violence. He seemed under a chronic irritation of the greatest"
"14979",5230,"intensity. His habit of talking to himself in a low voice grew steadily"
"14980",5230,"upon him, but though Mrs. Hall listened conscientiously she could make"
"14981",5230,"neither head nor tail of what she heard."
"14982",5230,""
"14983",5230,"He rarely went abroad by daylight, but at twilight he would go out"
"14984",5230,"muffled up invisibly, whether the weather were cold or not, and he"
"14985",5230,"chose the loneliest paths and those most overshadowed by trees and"
"14986",5230,"banks. His goggling spectacles and ghastly bandaged face under the"
"14987",5230,"penthouse of his hat, came with a disagreeable suddenness out of the"
"14988",5230,"darkness upon one or two home-going labourers, and Teddy Henfrey,"
"14989",5230,"tumbling out of the “Scarlet Coat” one night, at half-past nine, was"
"14990",5230,"scared shamefully by the stranger’s skull-like head (he was walking hat"
"14991",5230,"in hand) lit by the sudden light of the opened inn door. Such children"
"14992",5230,"as saw him at nightfall dreamt of bogies, and it seemed doubtful"
"14993",5230,"whether he disliked boys more than they disliked him, or the reverse;"
"14994",5230,"but there was certainly a vivid enough dislike on either side."
"14995",5230,""
"14996",5230,"It was inevitable that a person of so remarkable an appearance and"
"14997",5230,"bearing should form a frequent topic in such a village as Iping."
"14998",5230,"Opinion was greatly divided about his occupation. Mrs. Hall was"
"14999",5230,"sensitive on the point. When questioned, she explained very carefully"
"15000",5230,"that he was an “experimental investigator,” going gingerly over the"
"15001",5230,"syllables as one who dreads pitfalls. When asked what an experimental"
"15002",5230,"investigator was, she would say with a touch of superiority that most"
"15003",5230,"educated people knew such things as that, and would thus explain that"
"15004",5230,"he “discovered things.” Her visitor had had an accident, she said,"
"15005",5230,"which temporarily discoloured his face and hands, and being of a"
"15006",5230,"sensitive disposition, he was averse to any public notice of the fact."
"15007",5230,""
"15008",5230,"Out of her hearing there was a view largely entertained that he was a"
"15009",5230,"criminal trying to escape from justice by wrapping himself up so as to"
"15010",5230,"conceal himself altogether from the eye of the police. This idea sprang"
"15011",5230,"from the brain of Mr. Teddy Henfrey. No crime of any magnitude dating"
"15012",5230,"from the middle or end of February was known to have occurred."
"15013",5230,"Elaborated in the imagination of Mr. Gould, the probationary assistant"
"15014",5230,"in the National School, this theory took the form that the stranger was"
"15015",5230,"an Anarchist in disguise, preparing explosives, and he resolved to"
"15016",5230,"undertake such detective operations as his time permitted. These"
"15017",5230,"consisted for the most part in looking very hard at the stranger"
"15018",5230,"whenever they met, or in asking people who had never seen the stranger,"
"15019",5230,"leading questions about him. But he detected nothing."
"15020",5230,""
"15021",5230,"Another school of opinion followed Mr. Fearenside, and either accepted"
"15022",5230,"the piebald view or some modification of it; as, for instance, Silas"
"15023",5230,"Durgan, who was heard to assert that “if he chooses to show enself at"
"15024",5230,"fairs he’d make his fortune in no time,” and being a bit of a"
"15025",5230,"theologian, compared the stranger to the man with the one talent. Yet"
"15026",5230,"another view explained the entire matter by regarding the stranger as a"
"15027",5230,"harmless lunatic. That had the advantage of accounting for everything"
"15028",5230,"straight away."
"15029",5230,""
"15030",5230,"Between these main groups there were waverers and compromisers. Sussex"
"15031",5230,"folk have few superstitions, and it was only after the events of early"
"15032",5230,"April that the thought of the supernatural was first whispered in the"
"15033",5230,"village. Even then it was only credited among the women folk."
"15034",5230,""
"15035",5230,"But whatever they thought of him, people in Iping, on the whole, agreed"
"15036",5230,"in disliking him. His irritability, though it might have been"
"15037",5230,"comprehensible to an urban brain-worker, was an amazing thing to these"
"15038",5230,"quiet Sussex villagers. The frantic gesticulations they surprised now"
"15039",5230,"and then, the headlong pace after nightfall that swept him upon them"
"15040",5230,"round quiet corners, the inhuman bludgeoning of all tentative advances"
"15041",5230,"of curiosity, the taste for twilight that led to the closing of doors,"
"15042",5230,"the pulling down of blinds, the extinction of candles and lamps—who"
"15043",5230,"could agree with such goings on? They drew aside as he passed down the"
"15044",5230,"village, and when he had gone by, young humourists would up with"
"15045",5230,"coat-collars and down with hat-brims, and go pacing nervously after him"
"15046",5230,"in imitation of his occult bearing. There was a song popular at that"
"15047",5230,"time called “The Bogey Man”. Miss Statchell sang it at the schoolroom"
"15048",5230,"concert (in aid of the church lamps), and thereafter whenever one or"
"15049",5230,"two of the villagers were gathered together and the stranger appeared,"
"15050",5230,"a bar or so of this tune, more or less sharp or flat, was whistled in"
"15051",5230,"the midst of them. Also belated little children would call “Bogey Man!”"
"15052",5230,"after him, and make off tremulously elated."
"15053",5230,""
"15054",5230,"Cuss, the general practitioner, was devoured by curiosity. The bandages"
"15055",5230,"excited his professional interest, the report of the thousand and one"
"15056",5230,"bottles aroused his jealous regard. All through April and May he"
"15057",5230,"coveted an opportunity of talking to the stranger, and at last, towards"
"15058",5230,"Whitsuntide, he could stand it no longer, but hit upon the"
"15059",5230,"subscription-list for a village nurse as an excuse. He was surprised to"
"15060",5230,"find that Mr. Hall did not know his guest’s name. “He give a name,”"
"15061",5230,"said Mrs. Hall—an assertion which was quite unfounded—“but I didn’t"
"15062",5230,"rightly hear it.” She thought it seemed so silly not to know the man’s"
"15063",5230,"name."

"15073",5230,"and without looking at her strode across the hall and went down the"
"15074",5230,"steps, and she heard his feet hurrying along the road. He carried his"
"15075",5230,"hat in his hand. She stood behind the door, looking at the open door of"

"15077",5230,"footsteps came across the room. She could not see his face where she"

"15093",5230,"When his nerves had been steadied by a glass of cheap sherry—the only"
"15094",5230,"drink the good vicar had available—he told him of the interview he had"
"15095",5230,"just had. “Went in,” he gasped, “and began to demand a subscription for"
"15096",5230,"that Nurse Fund. He’d stuck his hands in his pockets as I came in, and"
"15097",5230,"he sat down lumpily in his chair. Sniffed. I told him I’d heard he took"
"15098",5230,"an interest in scientific things. He said yes. Sniffed again. Kept on"
"15099",5230,"sniffing all the time; evidently recently caught an infernal cold. No"
"15100",5230,"wonder, wrapped up like that! I developed the nurse idea, and all the"
"15101",5230,"while kept my eyes open. Bottles—chemicals—everywhere. Balance,"
"15102",5230,"test-tubes in stands, and a smell of—evening primrose. Would he"
"15103",5230,"subscribe? Said he’d consider it. Asked him, point-blank, was he"
"15104",5230,"researching. Said he was. A long research? Got quite cross. ‘A damnable"
"15105",5230,"long research,’ said he, blowing the cork out, so to speak. ‘Oh,’ said"
"15106",5230,"I. And out came the grievance. The man was just on the boil, and my"
"15107",5230,"question boiled him over. He had been given a prescription, most"
"15108",5230,"valuable prescription—what for he wouldn’t say. Was it medical? ‘Damn"
"15109",5230,"you! What are you fishing after?’ I apologised. Dignified sniff and"
"15110",5230,"cough. He resumed. He’d read it. Five ingredients. Put it down; turned"
"15111",5230,"his head. Draught of air from window lifted the paper. Swish, rustle."
"15112",5230,"He was working in a room with an open fireplace, he said. Saw a"
"15113",5230,"flicker, and there was the prescription burning and lifting"
"15114",5230,"chimneyward. Rushed towards it just as it whisked up the chimney. So!"
"15115",5230,"Just at that point, to illustrate his story, out came his arm.”"

"15122",5230,"open, if there’s nothing in it? There was nothing in it, I tell you."
"15123",5230,"Nothing down it, right down to the joint. I could see right down it to"

"15125",5230,"the cloth. ‘Good God!’ I said. Then he stopped. Stared at me with those"

"15130",5230,"“That’s all. He never said a word; just glared, and put his sleeve back"

"15145",5230,"again, and raised his arm towards me as though he would show it to me"

"15181",5230,""
"15182",5230,""
"15183",5230,"The facts of the burglary at the vicarage came to us chiefly through"
"15184",5230,"the medium of the vicar and his wife. It occurred in the small hours of"
"15185",5230,"Whit Monday, the day devoted in Iping to the Club festivities. Mrs."
"15186",5230,"Bunting, it seems, woke up suddenly in the stillness that comes before"
"15187",5230,"the dawn, with the strong impression that the door of their bedroom had"
"15188",5230,"opened and closed. She did not arouse her husband at first, but sat up"
"15189",5230,"in bed listening. She then distinctly heard the pad, pad, pad of bare"
"15190",5230,"feet coming out of the adjoining dressing-room and walking along the"
"15191",5230,"passage towards the staircase. As soon as she felt assured of this, she"
"15192",5230,"aroused the Rev. Mr. Bunting as quietly as possible. He did not strike"
"15193",5230,"a light, but putting on his spectacles, her dressing-gown and his bath"
"15194",5230,"slippers, he went out on the landing to listen. He heard quite"
"15195",5230,"distinctly a fumbling going on at his study desk down-stairs, and then"
"15196",5230,"a violent sneeze."
"15197",5230,""
"15198",5230,"At that he returned to his bedroom, armed himself with the most obvious"
"15199",5230,"weapon, the poker, and descended the staircase as noiselessly as"
"15200",5230,"possible. Mrs. Bunting came out on the landing."
"15201",5230,""
"15202",5230,"The hour was about four, and the ultimate darkness of the night was"
"15203",5230,"past. There was a faint shimmer of light in the hall, but the study"
"15204",5230,"doorway yawned impenetrably black. Everything was still except the"
"15205",5230,"faint creaking of the stairs under Mr. Bunting’s tread, and the slight"
"15206",5230,"movements in the study. Then something snapped, the drawer was opened,"
"15207",5230,"and there was a rustle of papers. Then came an imprecation, and a match"
"15208",5230,"was struck and the study was flooded with yellow light. Mr. Bunting was"
"15209",5230,"now in the hall, and through the crack of the door he could see the"
"15210",5230,"desk and the open drawer and a candle burning on the desk. But the"
"15211",5230,"robber he could not see. He stood there in the hall undecided what to"
"15212",5230,"do, and Mrs. Bunting, her face white and intent, crept slowly"
"15213",5230,"downstairs after him. One thing kept Mr. Bunting’s courage; the"
"15214",5230,"persuasion that this burglar was a resident in the village."
"15215",5230,""
"15216",5230,"They heard the chink of money, and realised that the robber had found"
"15217",5230,"the housekeeping reserve of gold—two pounds ten in half sovereigns"
"15218",5230,"altogether. At that sound Mr. Bunting was nerved to abrupt action."
"15219",5230,"Gripping the poker firmly, he rushed into the room, closely followed by"
"15220",5230,"Mrs. Bunting. “Surrender!” cried Mr. Bunting, fiercely, and then"
"15221",5230,"stooped amazed. Apparently the room was perfectly empty."
"15222",5230,""
"15223",5230,"Yet their conviction that they had, that very moment, heard somebody"
"15224",5230,"moving in the room had amounted to a certainty. For half a minute,"
"15225",5230,"perhaps, they stood gaping, then Mrs. Bunting went across the room and"
"15226",5230,"looked behind the screen, while Mr. Bunting, by a kindred impulse,"
"15227",5230,"peered under the desk. Then Mrs. Bunting turned back the"
"15228",5230,"window-curtains, and Mr. Bunting looked up the chimney and probed it"
"15229",5230,"with the poker. Then Mrs. Bunting scrutinised the waste-paper basket"
"15230",5230,"and Mr. Bunting opened the lid of the coal-scuttle. Then they came to a"
"15231",5230,"stop and stood with eyes interrogating each other."

"15251",5230,"of the door. It opened, stood open for a moment, and then closed with a"
"15252",5230,"slam. As it did so, the candle Mrs. Bunting was carrying from the study"

"15288",5230,"room upstairs and the suggestions of Mr. Teddy Henfrey. He distinctly"
"15289",5230,"remembered holding the candle while Mrs. Hall shot these bolts"
"15290",5230,"overnight. At the sight he stopped, gaping, then with the bottle still"
"15291",5230,"in his hand went upstairs again. He rapped at the stranger’s door."

"15321",5230,"following six steps behind, thought that he heard her sneeze. She,"

"15372",5230,"sunshine to rouse up Mr. Sandy Wadgers, the blacksmith. Mr. Hall’s"
"15373",5230,"compliments and the furniture upstairs was behaving most extraordinary."
"15374",5230,"Would Mr. Wadgers come round? He was a knowing man, was Mr. Wadgers,"
"15375",5230,"and very resourceful. He took quite a grave view of the case. “Arm"

"15379",5230,"He came round greatly concerned. They wanted him to lead the way"

"15382",5230,"out and began taking down the shutters of the tobacco window. He was"
"15383",5230,"called over to join the discussion. Mr. Huxter naturally followed over"
"15384",5230,"in the course of a few minutes. The Anglo-Saxon genius for"
"15385",5230,"parliamentary government asserted itself; there was a great deal of"
"15386",5230,"talk and no decisive action. “Let’s have the facts first,” insisted Mr."
"15387",5230,"Sandy Wadgers. “Let’s be sure we’d be acting perfectly right in bustin’"

"15394",5230,"blackly and blankly than ever with those unreasonably large blue glass"
"15395",5230,"eyes of his. He came down stiffly and slowly, staring all the time; he"

"15398",5230,"“Look there!” he said, and their eyes followed the direction of his"

"15727",5230,"in the corner by the doorway. The hitting continued. Phipps, the"
"15728",5230,"Unitarian, had a front tooth broken, and Henfrey was injured in the"
"15729",5230,"cartilage of his ear. Jaffers was struck under the jaw, and, turning,"
"15730",5230,"caught at something that intervened between him and Huxter in the"
"15731",5230,"mêlée, and prevented their coming together. He felt a muscular chest,"

"15799",5230,"leisurely manner—he did everything in a leisurely manner—he was"
"15800",5230,"contemplating trying on a pair of boots. They were the soundest boots"

"15802",5230,"ones he had were, in dry weather, a very comfortable fit, but too"

"15804",5230,"hated damp. He had never properly thought out which he hated most, and"
"15805",5230,"it was a pleasant day, and there was nothing better to do. So he put"
"15806",5230,"the four shoes in a graceful group on the turf and looked at them. And"
"15807",5230,"seeing them there among the grass and springing agrimony, it suddenly"
"15808",5230,"occurred to him that both pairs were exceedingly ugly to see. He was"

"16053",5230,"strange ideas transcending experience often have less effect upon men"
"16054",5230,"and women than smaller, more tangible considerations. Iping was gay"
"16055",5230,"with bunting, and everybody was in gala dress. Whit Monday had been"

"16057",5230,"believed in the Unseen were beginning to resume their little amusements"
"16058",5230,"in a tentative fashion, on the supposition that he had quite gone away,"
"16059",5230,"and with the sceptics he was already a jest. But people, sceptics and"
"16060",5230,"believers alike, were remarkably sociable all that day."
"16061",5230,""
"16062",5230,"Haysman’s meadow was gay with a tent, in which Mrs. Bunting and other"
"16063",5230,"ladies were preparing tea, while, without, the Sunday-school children"
"16064",5230,"ran races and played games under the noisy guidance of the curate and"
"16065",5230,"the Misses Cuss and Sackbut. No doubt there was a slight uneasiness in"
"16066",5230,"the air, but people for the most part had the sense to conceal whatever"
"16067",5230,"imaginative qualms they experienced. On the village green an inclined"

"16070",5230,"came in for considerable favour among the adolescents, as also did the"
"16071",5230,"swings and the cocoanut shies. There was also promenading, and the"
"16072",5230,"steam organ attached to a small roundabout filled the air with a"
"16073",5230,"pungent flavour of oil and with equally pungent music. Members of the"
"16074",5230,"club, who had attended church in the morning, were splendid in badges"
"16075",5230,"of pink and green, and some of the gayer-minded had also adorned their"
"16076",5230,"bowler hats with brilliant-coloured favours of ribbon. Old Fletcher,"
"16077",5230,"whose conceptions of holiday-making were severe, was visible through"
"16078",5230,"the jasmine about his window or through the open door (whichever way"
"16079",5230,"you chose to look), poised delicately on a plank supported on two"
"16080",5230,"chairs, and whitewashing the ceiling of his front room."
"16081",5230,""
"16082",5230,"About four o’clock a stranger entered the village from the direction of"
"16083",5230,"the downs. He was a short, stout person in an extraordinarily shabby"
"16084",5230,"top hat, and he appeared to be very much out of breath. His cheeks were"
"16085",5230,"alternately limp and tightly puffed. His mottled face was apprehensive,"
"16086",5230,"and he moved with a sort of reluctant alacrity. He turned the corner of"
"16087",5230,"the church, and directed his way to the “Coach and Horses.” Among"
"16088",5230,"others old Fletcher remembers seeing him, and indeed the old gentleman"
"16089",5230,"was so struck by his peculiar agitation that he inadvertently allowed a"

"16096",5230,"and, according to Mr. Huxter, appeared to undergo a severe internal"
"16097",5230,"struggle before he could induce himself to enter the house. Finally he"
"16098",5230,"marched up the steps, and was seen by Mr. Huxter to turn to the left"
"16099",5230,"and open the door of the parlour. Mr. Huxter heard voices from within"
"16100",5230,"the room and from the bar apprising the man of his error. “That room’s"

"16103",5230,""
"16104",5230,"In the course of a few minutes he reappeared, wiping his lips with the"
"16105",5230,"back of his hand with an air of quiet satisfaction that somehow"

"16107",5230,"moments, and then Mr. Huxter saw him walk in an oddly furtive manner"

"16111",5230,"fingers trembled while doing so. He lit it clumsily, and folding his"
"16112",5230,"arms began to smoke in a languid attitude, an attitude which his"

"16118",5230,""
"16119",5230,"Presently the stranger stood up abruptly and put his pipe in his"
"16120",5230,"pocket. Then he vanished into the yard. Forthwith Mr. Huxter,"
"16121",5230,"conceiving he was witness of some petty larceny, leapt round his"
"16122",5230,"counter and ran out into the road to intercept the thief. As he did so,"
"16123",5230,"Mr. Marvel reappeared, his hat askew, a big bundle in a blue"
"16124",5230,"table-cloth in one hand, and three books tied together—as it proved"
"16125",5230,"afterwards with the Vicar’s braces—in the other. Directly he saw Huxter"
"16126",5230,"he gave a sort of gasp, and turning sharply to the left, began to run."
"16127",5230,"“Stop, thief!” cried Huxter, and set off after him. Mr. Huxter’s"
"16128",5230,"sensations were vivid but brief. He saw the man just before him and"
"16129",5230,"spurting briskly for the church corner and the hill road. He saw the"
"16130",5230,"village flags and festivities beyond, and a face or so turned towards"
"16131",5230,"him. He bawled, “Stop!” again. He had hardly gone ten strides before"
"16132",5230,"his shin was caught in some mysterious fashion, and he was no longer"
"16133",5230,"running, but flying with inconceivable rapidity through the air. He saw"
"16134",5230,"the ground suddenly close to his face. The world seemed to splash into"
"16135",5230,"a million whirling specks of light, and subsequent proceedings"
"16136",5230,"interested him no more."

"16155",5230,"by Mrs. Hall and the room tidied up. And on the table under the window"
"16156",5230,"where the stranger had been wont to work, Cuss had hit almost at once"

"16442",5230,"his feet, was knocked against and thrown on all fours again, and became"
"16443",5230,"aware that he was involved not in a capture, but a rout. Everyone was"

"17062",5230,"burst open. They heard Marvel squeal like a caught leveret, and"

"17116",5230,""
"17117",5230,"Dr. Kemp had continued writing in his study until the shots aroused"
"17118",5230,"him. Crack, crack, crack, they came one after the other."
"17119",5230,""
"17120",5230,"“Hullo!” said Dr. Kemp, putting his pen into his mouth again and"

"17122",5230,"at now?”"
"17123",5230,""
"17124",5230,"He went to the south window, threw it up, and leaning out stared down"
"17125",5230,"on the network of windows, beaded gas-lamps and shops, with its black"
"17126",5230,"interstices of roof and yard that made up the town at night. “Looks"
"17127",5230,"like a crowd down the hill,” he said, “by ‘The Cricketers,’” and"
"17128",5230,"remained watching. Thence his eyes wandered over the town to far away"
"17129",5230,"where the ships’ lights shone, and the pier glowed—a little"
"17130",5230,"illuminated, facetted pavilion like a gem of yellow light. The moon in"
"17131",5230,"its first quarter hung over the westward hill, and the stars were clear"
"17132",5230,"and almost tropically bright."
"17133",5230,""
"17134",5230,"After five minutes, during which his mind had travelled into a remote"
"17135",5230,"speculation of social conditions of the future, and lost itself at last"
"17136",5230,"over the time dimension, Dr. Kemp roused himself with a sigh, pulled"
"17137",5230,"down the window again, and returned to his writing desk."
"17138",5230,""
"17139",5230,"It must have been about an hour after this that the front-door bell"
"17140",5230,"rang. He had been writing slackly, and with intervals of abstraction,"
"17141",5230,"since the shots. He sat listening. He heard the servant answer the"
"17142",5230,"door, and waited for her feet on the staircase, but she did not come."
"17143",5230,"“Wonder what that was,” said Dr. Kemp."
"17144",5230,""
"17145",5230,"He tried to resume his work, failed, got up, went downstairs from his"
"17146",5230,"study to the landing, rang, and called over the balustrade to the"
"17147",5230,"housemaid as she appeared in the hall below. “Was that a letter?” he"
"17148",5230,"asked."
"17149",5230,""
"17150",5230,"“Only a runaway ring, sir,” she answered."
"17151",5230,""
"17152",5230,"“I’m restless to-night,” he said to himself. He went back to his study,"
"17153",5230,"and this time attacked his work resolutely. In a little while he was"
"17154",5230,"hard at work again, and the only sounds in the room were the ticking of"
"17155",5230,"the clock and the subdued shrillness of his quill, hurrying in the very"
"17156",5230,"centre of the circle of light his lampshade threw on his table."
"17157",5230,""
"17158",5230,"It was two o’clock before Dr. Kemp had finished his work for the night."
"17159",5230,"He rose, yawned, and went downstairs to bed. He had already removed his"
"17160",5230,"coat and vest, when he noticed that he was thirsty. He took a candle"
"17161",5230,"and went down to the dining-room in search of a syphon and whiskey."
"17162",5230,""
"17163",5230,"Dr. Kemp’s scientific pursuits have made him a very observant man, and"
"17164",5230,"as he recrossed the hall, he noticed a dark spot on the linoleum near"
"17165",5230,"the mat at the foot of the stairs. He went on upstairs, and then it"
"17166",5230,"suddenly occurred to him to ask himself what the spot on the linoleum"
"17167",5230,"might be. Apparently some subconscious element was at work. At any"
"17168",5230,"rate, he turned with his burden, went back to the hall, put down the"
"17169",5230,"syphon and whiskey, and bending down, touched the spot. Without any"
"17170",5230,"great surprise he found it had the stickiness and colour of drying"
"17171",5230,"blood."
"17172",5230,""
"17173",5230,"He took up his burden again, and returned upstairs, looking about him"
"17174",5230,"and trying to account for the blood-spot. On the landing he saw"
"17175",5230,"something and stopped astonished. The door-handle of his own room was"
"17176",5230,"blood-stained."
"17177",5230,""
"17178",5230,"He looked at his own hand. It was quite clean, and then he remembered"
"17179",5230,"that the door of his room had been open when he came down from his"
"17180",5230,"study, and that consequently he had not touched the handle at all. He"
"17181",5230,"went straight into his room, his face quite calm—perhaps a trifle more"
"17182",5230,"resolute than usual. His glance, wandering inquisitively, fell on the"
"17183",5230,"bed. On the counterpane was a mess of blood, and the sheet had been"
"17184",5230,"torn. He had not noticed this before because he had walked straight to"
"17185",5230,"the dressing-table. On the further side the bedclothes were depressed"
"17186",5230,"as if someone had been recently sitting there."
"17187",5230,""
"17188",5230,"Then he had an odd impression that he had heard a low voice say, “Good"
"17189",5230,"Heavens!—Kemp!” But Dr. Kemp was no believer in voices."
"17190",5230,""
"17191",5230,"He stood staring at the tumbled sheets. Was that really a voice? He"
"17192",5230,"looked about again, but noticed nothing further than the disordered and"
"17193",5230,"blood-stained bed. Then he distinctly heard a movement across the room,"
"17194",5230,"near the wash-hand stand. All men, however highly educated, retain some"
"17195",5230,"superstitious inklings. The feeling that is called “eerie” came upon"
"17196",5230,"him. He closed the door of the room, came forward to the"
"17197",5230,"dressing-table, and put down his burdens. Suddenly, with a start, he"
"17198",5230,"perceived a coiled and blood-stained bandage of linen rag hanging in"
"17199",5230,"mid-air, between him and the wash-hand stand."
"17200",5230,""
"17201",5230,"He stared at this in amazement. It was an empty bandage, a bandage"
"17202",5230,"properly tied but quite empty. He would have advanced to grasp it, but"
"17203",5230,"a touch arrested him, and a voice speaking quite close to him."
"17204",5230,""
"17205",5230,"“Kemp!” said the Voice."

"17207",5230,"“Eh?” said Kemp, with his mouth open."

"17216",5230,"The story he had been active to ridicule only that morning rushed"
"17217",5230,"through Kemp’s brain. He does not appear to have been either very much"
"17218",5230,"frightened or very greatly surprised at the moment. Realisation came"
"17219",5230,"later."
"17220",5230,""
"17221",5230,"“I thought it was all a lie,” he said. The thought uppermost in his"
"17222",5230,"mind was the reiterated arguments of the morning. “Have you a bandage"
"17223",5230,"on?” he asked."
"17224",5230,""
"17225",5230,"“Yes,” said the Invisible Man."
"17226",5230,""
"17227",5230,"“Oh!” said Kemp, and then roused himself. “I say!” he said. “But this"
"17228",5230,"is nonsense. It’s some trick.” He stepped forward suddenly, and his"
"17229",5230,"hand, extended towards the bandage, met invisible fingers."
"17230",5230,""
"17231",5230,"He recoiled at the touch and his colour changed."
"17232",5230,""
"17233",5230,"“Keep steady, Kemp, for God’s sake! I want help badly. Stop!”"
"17234",5230,""

"17237",5230,"“Kemp!” cried the Voice. “Kemp! Keep steady!” and the grip tightened."
"17238",5230,""
"17239",5230,"A frantic desire to free himself took possession of Kemp. The hand of"
"17240",5230,"the bandaged arm gripped his shoulder, and he was suddenly tripped and"
"17241",5230,"flung backwards upon the bed. He opened his mouth to shout, and the"
"17242",5230,"corner of the sheet was thrust between his teeth. The Invisible Man had"
"17243",5230,"him down grimly, but his arms were free and he struck and tried to kick"
"17244",5230,"savagely."
"17245",5230,""
"17246",5230,"“Listen to reason, will you?” said the Invisible Man, sticking to him"

"17249",5230,""
"17250",5230,"“Lie still, you fool!” bawled the Invisible Man in Kemp’s ear."

"17478",5230,"“I’m sorry,” said the Invisible Man, “if I cannot tell you all that I"
"17479",5230,"have done to-night. But I am worn out. It’s grotesque, no doubt. It’s"
"17480",5230,"horrible! But believe me, Kemp, in spite of your arguments of this"
"17481",5230,"morning, it is quite a possible thing. I have made a discovery. I meant"
"17482",5230,"to keep it to myself. I can’t. I must have a partner. And you.... We"

"17538",5230,"out of the room, and went into his little consulting-room and lit the"
"17539",5230,"gas there. It was a little room, because Dr. Kemp did not live by"
"17540",5230,"practice, and in it were the day’s newspapers. The morning’s paper lay"
"17541",5230,"carelessly opened and thrown aside. He caught it up, turned it over,"
"17542",5230,"and read the account of a “Strange Story from Iping” that the mariner"

"17575",5230,"When dawn came to mingle its pallor with the lamp-light and cigar smoke"

"17579",5230,"He was altogether too excited to sleep. His servants, descending"

"17582",5230,"explicit instructions to lay breakfast for two in the belvedere"
"17583",5230,"study—and then to confine themselves to the basement and ground-floor."
"17584",5230,"Then he continued to pace the dining-room until the morning’s paper"

"17586",5230,"of the evening before, and a very badly written account of another"
"17587",5230,"remarkable tale from Port Burdock. This gave Kemp the essence of the"
"17588",5230,"happenings at the “Jolly Cricketers,” and the name of Marvel. “He has"
"17589",5230,"made me keep with him twenty-four hours,” Marvel testified. Certain"
"17590",5230,"minor facts were added to the Iping story, notably the cutting of the"
"17591",5230,"village telegraph-wire. But there was nothing to throw light on the"
"17592",5230,"connexion between the Invisible Man and the Tramp; for Mr. Marvel had"
"17593",5230,"supplied no information about the three books, or the money with which"
"17594",5230,"he was lined. The incredulous tone had vanished and a shoal of"

"17705",5230,"“Precisely,” said Griffin. “But consider, visibility depends on the"
"17706",5230,"action of the visible bodies on light. Either a body absorbs light, or"
"17707",5230,"it reflects or refracts it, or does all these things. If it neither"
"17708",5230,"reflects nor refracts nor absorbs light, it cannot of itself be"
"17709",5230,"visible. You see an opaque red box, for instance, because the colour"
"17710",5230,"absorbs some of the light and reflects the rest, all the red part of"
"17711",5230,"the light, to you. If it did not absorb any particular part of the"
"17712",5230,"light, but reflected it all, then it would be a shining white box."
"17713",5230,"Silver! A diamond box would neither absorb much of the light nor"
"17714",5230,"reflect much from the general surface, but just here and there where"
"17715",5230,"the surfaces were favourable the light would be reflected and"
"17716",5230,"refracted, so that you would get a brilliant appearance of flashing"
"17717",5230,"reflections and translucencies—a sort of skeleton of light. A glass box"
"17718",5230,"would not be so brilliant, nor so clearly visible, as a diamond box,"
"17719",5230,"because there would be less refraction and reflection. See that? From"
"17720",5230,"certain points of view you would see quite clearly through it. Some"
"17721",5230,"kinds of glass would be more visible than others, a box of flint glass"
"17722",5230,"would be brighter than a box of ordinary window glass. A box of very"
"17723",5230,"thin common glass would be hard to see in a bad light, because it would"
"17724",5230,"absorb hardly any light and refract and reflect very little. And if you"
"17725",5230,"put a sheet of common white glass in water, still more if you put it in"
"17726",5230,"some denser liquid than water, it would vanish almost altogether,"
"17727",5230,"because light passing from water to glass is only slightly refracted or"
"17728",5230,"reflected or indeed affected in any way. It is almost as invisible as a"
"17729",5230,"jet of coal gas or hydrogen is in air. And for precisely the same"
"17730",5230,"reason!”"
"17731",5230,""
"17732",5230,"“Yes,” said Kemp, “that is pretty plain sailing.”"
"17733",5230,""
"17734",5230,"“And here is another fact you will know to be true. If a sheet of glass"
"17735",5230,"is smashed, Kemp, and beaten into a powder, it becomes much more"
"17736",5230,"visible while it is in the air; it becomes at last an opaque white"
"17737",5230,"powder. This is because the powdering multiplies the surfaces of the"
"17738",5230,"glass at which refraction and reflection occur. In the sheet of glass"
"17739",5230,"there are only two surfaces; in the powder the light is reflected or"
"17740",5230,"refracted by each grain it passes through, and very little gets right"
"17741",5230,"through the powder. But if the white powdered glass is put into water,"
"17742",5230,"it forthwith vanishes. The powdered glass and water have much the same"
"17743",5230,"refractive index; that is, the light undergoes very little refraction"
"17744",5230,"or reflection in passing from one to the other."
"17745",5230,""
"17746",5230,"“You make the glass invisible by putting it into a liquid of nearly the"
"17747",5230,"same refractive index; a transparent thing becomes invisible if it is"

"17749",5230,"consider only a second, you will see also that the powder of glass"
"17750",5230,"might be made to vanish in air, if its refractive index could be made"
"17751",5230,"the same as that of air; for then there would be no refraction or"

"17763",5230,"transparent fibres, and it is white and opaque only for the same reason"
"17764",5230,"that a powder of glass is white and opaque. Oil white paper, fill up"
"17765",5230,"the interstices between the particles with oil so that there is no"
"17766",5230,"longer refraction or reflection except at the surfaces, and it becomes"

"17945",5230,"suspected me of vivisecting—a drink-sodden old creature, with only a"
"17946",5230,"white cat to care for in all the world. I whipped out some chloroform,"
"17947",5230,"applied it, and answered the door. ‘Did I hear a cat?’ she asked. ‘My"
"17948",5230,"cat?’ ‘Not here,’ said I, very politely. She was a little doubtful and"
"17949",5230,"tried to peer past me into the room; strange enough to her no"

"17951",5230,"vibrating, and the seethe of the radiant points, and that faint ghastly"
"17952",5230,"stinging of chloroform in the air. She had to be satisfied at last and"

"18538",5230,"lamp. Down he went, and I crouched down behind the counter and began"
"18539",5230,"whipping off my clothes as fast as I could. Coat, jacket, trousers,"

"18850",5230,"whatever the consequences might be, was nothing to me. I had merely to"
"18851",5230,"fling aside my garments and vanish. No person could hold me. I could"
"18852",5230,"take my money where I found it. I decided to treat myself to a"
"18853",5230,"sumptuous feast, and then put up at a good hotel, and accumulate a new"
"18854",5230,"outfit of property. I felt amazingly confident; it’s not particularly"

"18856",5230,"already ordering lunch, when it occurred to me that I could not eat"

"18866",5230,"but of course it was not their affair—and so at last I got my lunch. It"

"19200",5230,""
"19201",5230,"The Invisible Man seems to have rushed out of Kemp’s house in a state"
"19202",5230,"of blind fury. A little child playing near Kemp’s gateway was violently"
"19203",5230,"caught up and thrown aside, so that its ankle was broken, and"
"19204",5230,"thereafter for some hours the Invisible Man passed out of human"
"19205",5230,"perceptions. No one knows where he went nor what he did. But one can"
"19206",5230,"imagine him hurrying through the hot June forenoon, up the hill and on"
"19207",5230,"to the open downland behind Port Burdock, raging and despairing at his"
"19208",5230,"intolerable fate, and sheltering at last, heated and weary, amid the"
"19209",5230,"thickets of Hintondean, to piece together again his shattered schemes"
"19210",5230,"against his species. That seems the most probable refuge for him, for"
"19211",5230,"there it was he re-asserted himself in a grimly tragical manner about"
"19212",5230,"two in the afternoon."
"19213",5230,""
"19214",5230,"One wonders what his state of mind may have been during that time, and"
"19215",5230,"what plans he devised. No doubt he was almost ecstatically exasperated"
"19216",5230,"by Kemp’s treachery, and though we may be able to understand the"
"19217",5230,"motives that led to that deceit, we may still imagine and even"
"19218",5230,"sympathise a little with the fury the attempted surprise must have"
"19219",5230,"occasioned. Perhaps something of the stunned astonishment of his Oxford"
"19220",5230,"Street experiences may have returned to him, for he had evidently"
"19221",5230,"counted on Kemp’s co-operation in his brutal dream of a terrorised"
"19222",5230,"world. At any rate he vanished from human ken about midday, and no"
"19223",5230,"living witness can tell what he did until about half-past two. It was a"
"19224",5230,"fortunate thing, perhaps, for humanity, but for him it was a fatal"
"19225",5230,"inaction."
"19226",5230,""
"19227",5230,"During that time a growing multitude of men scattered over the"
"19228",5230,"countryside were busy. In the morning he had still been simply a"
"19229",5230,"legend, a terror; in the afternoon, by virtue chiefly of Kemp’s drily"
"19230",5230,"worded proclamation, he was presented as a tangible antagonist, to be"
"19231",5230,"wounded, captured, or overcome, and the countryside began organising"
"19232",5230,"itself with inconceivable rapidity. By two o’clock even he might still"
"19233",5230,"have removed himself out of the district by getting aboard a train, but"
"19234",5230,"after two that became impossible. Every passenger train along the lines"
"19235",5230,"on a great parallelogram between Southampton, Manchester, Brighton and"
"19236",5230,"Horsham, travelled with locked doors, and the goods traffic was almost"
"19237",5230,"entirely suspended. And in a great circle of twenty miles round Port"
"19238",5230,"Burdock, men armed with guns and bludgeons were presently setting out"
"19239",5230,"in groups of three and four, with dogs, to beat the roads and fields."
"19240",5230,""
"19241",5230,"Mounted policemen rode along the country lanes, stopping at every"

"19244",5230,"broken up by three o’clock, and the children, scared and keeping"
"19245",5230,"together in groups, were hurrying home. Kemp’s proclamation—signed"
"19246",5230,"indeed by Adye—was posted over almost the whole district by four or"
"19247",5230,"five o’clock in the afternoon. It gave briefly but clearly all the"
"19248",5230,"conditions of the struggle, the necessity of keeping the Invisible Man"
"19249",5230,"from food and sleep, the necessity for incessant watchfulness and for a"
"19250",5230,"prompt attention to any evidence of his movements. And so swift and"
"19251",5230,"decided was the action of the authorities, so prompt and universal was"
"19252",5230,"the belief in this strange being, that before nightfall an area of"
"19253",5230,"several hundred square miles was in a stringent state of siege. And"
"19254",5230,"before nightfall, too, a thrill of horror went through the whole"
"19255",5230,"watching nervous countryside. Going from whispering mouth to mouth,"
"19256",5230,"swift and certain over the length and breadth of the country, passed"
"19257",5230,"the story of the murder of Mr. Wicksteed."
"19258",5230,""
"19259",5230,"If our supposition that the Invisible Man’s refuge was the Hintondean"
"19260",5230,"thickets, then we must suppose that in the early afternoon he sallied"
"19261",5230,"out again bent upon some project that involved the use of a weapon. We"
"19262",5230,"cannot know what the project was, but the evidence that he had the iron"
"19263",5230,"rod in hand before he met Wicksteed is to me at least overwhelming."
"19264",5230,""
"19265",5230,"Of course we can know nothing of the details of that encounter. It"
"19266",5230,"occurred on the edge of a gravel pit, not two hundred yards from Lord"
"19267",5230,"Burdock’s lodge gate. Everything points to a desperate struggle—the"
"19268",5230,"trampled ground, the numerous wounds Mr. Wicksteed received, his"
"19269",5230,"splintered walking-stick; but why the attack was made, save in a"
"19270",5230,"murderous frenzy, it is impossible to imagine. Indeed the theory of"
"19271",5230,"madness is almost unavoidable. Mr. Wicksteed was a man of forty-five or"
"19272",5230,"forty-six, steward to Lord Burdock, of inoffensive habits and"
"19273",5230,"appearance, the very last person in the world to provoke such a"
"19274",5230,"terrible antagonist. Against him it would seem the Invisible Man used"
"19275",5230,"an iron rod dragged from a broken piece of fence. He stopped this quiet"
"19276",5230,"man, going quietly home to his midday meal, attacked him, beat down his"
"19277",5230,"feeble defences, broke his arm, felled him, and smashed his head to a"
"19278",5230,"jelly."
"19279",5230,""
"19280",5230,"Of course, he must have dragged this rod out of the fencing before he"
"19281",5230,"met his victim—he must have been carrying it ready in his hand. Only"
"19282",5230,"two details beyond what has already been stated seem to bear on the"
"19283",5230,"matter. One is the circumstance that the gravel pit was not in Mr."
"19284",5230,"Wicksteed’s direct path home, but nearly a couple of hundred yards out"
"19285",5230,"of his way. The other is the assertion of a little girl to the effect"
"19286",5230,"that, going to her afternoon school, she saw the murdered man"
"19287",5230,"“trotting” in a peculiar manner across a field towards the gravel pit."
"19288",5230,"Her pantomime of his action suggests a man pursuing something on the"
"19289",5230,"ground before him and striking at it ever and again with his"
"19290",5230,"walking-stick. She was the last person to see him alive. He passed out"
"19291",5230,"of her sight to his death, the struggle being hidden from her only by a"
"19292",5230,"clump of beech trees and a slight depression in the ground."
"19293",5230,""
"19294",5230,"Now this, to the present writer’s mind at least, lifts the murder out"
"19295",5230,"of the realm of the absolutely wanton. We may imagine that Griffin had"
"19296",5230,"taken the rod as a weapon indeed, but without any deliberate intention"
"19297",5230,"of using it in murder. Wicksteed may then have come by and noticed this"
"19298",5230,"rod inexplicably moving through the air. Without any thought of the"
"19299",5230,"Invisible Man—for Port Burdock is ten miles away—he may have pursued"
"19300",5230,"it. It is quite conceivable that he may not even have heard of the"
"19301",5230,"Invisible Man. One can then imagine the Invisible Man making"
"19302",5230,"off—quietly in order to avoid discovering his presence in the"
"19303",5230,"neighbourhood, and Wicksteed, excited and curious, pursuing this"
"19304",5230,"unaccountably locomotive object—finally striking at it."
"19305",5230,""
"19306",5230,"No doubt the Invisible Man could easily have distanced his middle-aged"
"19307",5230,"pursuer under ordinary circumstances, but the position in which"
"19308",5230,"Wicksteed’s body was found suggests that he had the ill luck to drive"
"19309",5230,"his quarry into a corner between a drift of stinging nettles and the"
"19310",5230,"gravel pit. To those who appreciate the extraordinary irascibility of"
"19311",5230,"the Invisible Man, the rest of the encounter will be easy to imagine."
"19312",5230,""
"19313",5230,"But this is pure hypothesis. The only undeniable facts—for stories of"
"19314",5230,"children are often unreliable—are the discovery of Wicksteed’s body,"
"19315",5230,"done to death, and of the blood-stained iron rod flung among the"
"19316",5230,"nettles. The abandonment of the rod by Griffin, suggests that in the"
"19317",5230,"emotional excitement of the affair, the purpose for which he took it—if"
"19318",5230,"he had a purpose—was abandoned. He was certainly an intensely"
"19319",5230,"egotistical and unfeeling man, but the sight of his victim, his first"
"19320",5230,"victim, bloody and pitiful at his feet, may have released some long"
"19321",5230,"pent fountain of remorse which for a time may have flooded whatever"
"19322",5230,"scheme of action he had contrived."
"19323",5230,""
"19324",5230,"After the murder of Mr. Wicksteed, he would seem to have struck across"
"19325",5230,"the country towards the downland. There is a story of a voice heard"
"19326",5230,"about sunset by a couple of men in a field near Fern Bottom. It was"
"19327",5230,"wailing and laughing, sobbing and groaning, and ever and again it"
"19328",5230,"shouted. It must have been queer hearing. It drove up across the middle"
"19329",5230,"of a clover field and died away towards the hills."
"19330",5230,""
"19331",5230,"That afternoon the Invisible Man must have learnt something of the"
"19332",5230,"rapid use Kemp had made of his confidences. He must have found houses"
"19333",5230,"locked and secured; he may have loitered about railway stations and"
"19334",5230,"prowled about inns, and no doubt he read the proclamations and realised"
"19335",5230,"something of the nature of the campaign against him. And as the evening"
"19336",5230,"advanced, the fields became dotted here and there with groups of three"
"19337",5230,"or four men, and noisy with the yelping of dogs. These men-hunters had"
"19338",5230,"particular instructions in the case of an encounter as to the way they"
"19339",5230,"should support one another. But he avoided them all. We may understand"
"19340",5230,"something of his exasperation, and it could have been none the less"
"19341",5230,"because he himself had supplied the information that was being used so"
"19342",5230,"remorselessly against him. For that day at least he lost heart; for"
"19343",5230,"nearly twenty-four hours, save when he turned on Wicksteed, he was a"
"19344",5230,"hunted man. In the night, he must have eaten and slept; for in the"
"19345",5230,"morning he was himself again, active, powerful, angry, and malignant,"

"19461",5230,"The two men stopped in the doorway, contemplating the wreckage. Kemp"
"19462",5230,"swore again, and as he did so the third window went with a snap like a"
"19463",5230,"pistol, hung starred for a moment, and collapsed in jagged, shivering"
"19464",5230,"triangles into the room."
"19465",5230,""
"19466",5230,"“What’s this for?” said Adye."
"19467",5230,""
"19468",5230,"“It’s a beginning,” said Kemp."
"19469",5230,""
"19470",5230,"“There’s no way of climbing up here?”"
"19471",5230,""
"19472",5230,"“Not for a cat,” said Kemp."
"19473",5230,""
"19474",5230,"“No shutters?”"
"19475",5230,""
"19476",5230,"“Not here. All the downstairs rooms—Hullo!”"
"19477",5230,""
"19478",5230,"Smash, and then whack of boards hit hard came from downstairs."
"19479",5230,"“Confound him!” said Kemp. “That must be—yes—it’s one of the bedrooms."
"19480",5230,"He’s going to do all the house. But he’s a fool. The shutters are up,"
"19481",5230,"and the glass will fall outside. He’ll cut his feet.”"
"19482",5230,""
"19483",5230,"Another window proclaimed its destruction. The two men stood on the"
"19484",5230,"landing perplexed. “I have it!” said Adye. “Let me have a stick or"
"19485",5230,"something, and I’ll go down to the station and get the bloodhounds put"
"19486",5230,"on. That ought to settle him! They’re hard by—not ten minutes—”"
"19487",5230,""
"19488",5230,"Another window went the way of its fellows."
"19489",5230,""
"19490",5230,"“You haven’t a revolver?” asked Adye."
"19491",5230,""
"19492",5230,"Kemp’s hand went to his pocket. Then he hesitated. “I haven’t one—at"
"19493",5230,"least to spare.”"
"19494",5230,""
"19495",5230,"“I’ll bring it back,” said Adye, “you’ll be safe here.”"
"19496",5230,""
"19497",5230,"Kemp, ashamed of his momentary lapse from truthfulness, handed him the"
"19498",5230,"weapon."
"19499",5230,""
"19500",5230,"“Now for the door,” said Adye."
"19501",5230,""
"19502",5230,"As they stood hesitating in the hall, they heard one of the first-floor"
"19503",5230,"bedroom windows crack and clash. Kemp went to the door and began to"
"19504",5230,"slip the bolts as silently as possible. His face was a little paler"
"19505",5230,"than usual. “You must step straight out,” said Kemp. In another moment"
"19506",5230,"Adye was on the doorstep and the bolts were dropping back into the"
"19507",5230,"staples. He hesitated for a moment, feeling more comfortable with his"
"19508",5230,"back against the door. Then he marched, upright and square, down the"
"19509",5230,"steps. He crossed the lawn and approached the gate. A little breeze"
"19510",5230,"seemed to ripple over the grass. Something moved near him. “Stop a"
"19511",5230,"bit,” said a Voice, and Adye stopped dead and his hand tightened on the"
"19512",5230,"revolver."
"19513",5230,""
"19514",5230,"“Well?” said Adye, white and grim, and every nerve tense."
"19515",5230,""
"19516",5230,"“Oblige me by going back to the house,” said the Voice, as tense and"
"19517",5230,"grim as Adye’s."
"19518",5230,""
"19519",5230,"“Sorry,” said Adye a little hoarsely, and moistened his lips with his"
"19520",5230,"tongue. The Voice was on his left front, he thought. Suppose he were to"
"19521",5230,"take his luck with a shot?"
"19522",5230,""
"19523",5230,"“What are you going for?” said the Voice, and there was a quick"
"19524",5230,"movement of the two, and a flash of sunlight from the open lip of"
"19525",5230,"Adye’s pocket."
"19526",5230,""
"19527",5230,"Adye desisted and thought. “Where I go,” he said slowly, “is my own"
"19528",5230,"business.” The words were still on his lips, when an arm came round his"
"19529",5230,"neck, his back felt a knee, and he was sprawling backward. He drew"
"19530",5230,"clumsily and fired absurdly, and in another moment he was struck in the"
"19531",5230,"mouth and the revolver wrested from his grip. He made a vain clutch at"
"19532",5230,"a slippery limb, tried to struggle up and fell back. “Damn!” said Adye."
"19533",5230,"The Voice laughed. “I’d kill you now if it wasn’t the waste of a"
"19534",5230,"bullet,” it said. He saw the revolver in mid-air, six feet off,"
"19535",5230,"covering him."
"19536",5230,""
"19537",5230,"“Well?” said Adye, sitting up."
"19538",5230,""
"19539",5230,"“Get up,” said the Voice."
"19540",5230,""
"19541",5230,"Adye stood up."
"19542",5230,""
"19543",5230,"“Attention,” said the Voice, and then fiercely, “Don’t try any games."
"19544",5230,"Remember I can see your face if you can’t see mine. You’ve got to go"
"19545",5230,"back to the house.”"
"19546",5230,""
"19547",5230,"“He won’t let me in,” said Adye."
"19548",5230,""
"19549",5230,"“That’s a pity,” said the Invisible Man. “I’ve got no quarrel with"
"19550",5230,"you.”"
"19551",5230,""
"19552",5230,"Adye moistened his lips again. He glanced away from the barrel of the"
"19553",5230,"revolver and saw the sea far off very blue and dark under the midday"
"19554",5230,"sun, the smooth green down, the white cliff of the Head, and the"
"19555",5230,"multitudinous town, and suddenly he knew that life was very sweet. His"
"19556",5230,"eyes came back to this little metal thing hanging between heaven and"
"19557",5230,"earth, six yards away. “What am I to do?” he said sullenly."
"19558",5230,""
"19559",5230,"“What am _I_ to do?” asked the Invisible Man. “You will get help. The"
"19560",5230,"only thing is for you to go back.”"
"19561",5230,""
"19562",5230,"“I will try. If he lets me in will you promise not to rush the door?”"
"19563",5230,""
"19564",5230,"“I’ve got no quarrel with you,” said the Voice."
"19565",5230,""
"19566",5230,"Kemp had hurried upstairs after letting Adye out, and now crouching"
"19567",5230,"among the broken glass and peering cautiously over the edge of the"
"19568",5230,"study window sill, he saw Adye stand parleying with the Unseen. “Why"
"19569",5230,"doesn’t he fire?” whispered Kemp to himself. Then the revolver moved a"
"19570",5230,"little and the glint of the sunlight flashed in Kemp’s eyes. He shaded"
"19571",5230,"his eyes and tried to see the source of the blinding beam."
"19572",5230,""
"19573",5230,"“Surely!” he said, “Adye has given up the revolver.”"
"19574",5230,""
"19575",5230,"“Promise not to rush the door,” Adye was saying. “Don’t push a winning"
"19576",5230,"game too far. Give a man a chance.”"
"19577",5230,""
"19578",5230,"“You go back to the house. I tell you flatly I will not promise"
"19579",5230,"anything.”"
"19580",5230,""
"19581",5230,"Adye’s decision seemed suddenly made. He turned towards the house,"
"19582",5230,"walking slowly with his hands behind him. Kemp watched him—puzzled. The"
"19583",5230,"revolver vanished, flashed again into sight, vanished again, and became"
"19584",5230,"evident on a closer scrutiny as a little dark object following Adye."
"19585",5230,"Then things happened very quickly. Adye leapt backwards, swung around,"
"19586",5230,"clutched at this little object, missed it, threw up his hands and fell"
"19587",5230,"forward on his face, leaving a little puff of blue in the air. Kemp did"
"19588",5230,"not hear the sound of the shot. Adye writhed, raised himself on one"
"19589",5230,"arm, fell forward, and lay still."
"19590",5230,""
"19591",5230,"For a space Kemp remained staring at the quiet carelessness of Adye’s"
"19592",5230,"attitude. The afternoon was very hot and still, nothing seemed stirring"
"19593",5230,"in all the world save a couple of yellow butterflies chasing each other"
"19594",5230,"through the shrubbery between the house and the road gate. Adye lay on"
"19595",5230,"the lawn near the gate. The blinds of all the villas down the hill-road"
"19596",5230,"were drawn, but in one little green summer-house was a white figure,"
"19597",5230,"apparently an old man asleep. Kemp scrutinised the surroundings of the"
"19598",5230,"house for a glimpse of the revolver, but it had vanished. His eyes came"
"19599",5230,"back to Adye. The game was opening well."
"19600",5230,""
"19601",5230,"Then came a ringing and knocking at the front door, that grew at last"
"19602",5230,"tumultuous, but pursuant to Kemp’s instructions the servants had locked"
"19603",5230,"themselves into their rooms. This was followed by a silence. Kemp sat"
"19604",5230,"listening and then began peering cautiously out of the three windows,"
"19605",5230,"one after another. He went to the staircase head and stood listening"
"19606",5230,"uneasily. He armed himself with his bedroom poker, and went to examine"
"19607",5230,"the interior fastenings of the ground-floor windows again. Everything"
"19608",5230,"was safe and quiet. He returned to the belvedere. Adye lay motionless"
"19609",5230,"over the edge of the gravel just as he had fallen. Coming along the"
"19610",5230,"road by the villas were the housemaid and two policemen."
"19611",5230,""
"19612",5230,"Everything was deadly still. The three people seemed very slow in"
"19613",5230,"approaching. He wondered what his antagonist was doing."
"19614",5230,""
"19615",5230,"He started. There was a smash from below. He hesitated and went"
"19616",5230,"downstairs again. Suddenly the house resounded with heavy blows and the"
"19617",5230,"splintering of wood. He heard a smash and the destructive clang of the"
"19618",5230,"iron fastenings of the shutters. He turned the key and opened the"
"19619",5230,"kitchen door. As he did so, the shutters, split and splintering, came"
"19620",5230,"flying inward. He stood aghast. The window frame, save for one"
"19621",5230,"crossbar, was still intact, but only little teeth of glass remained in"
"19622",5230,"the frame. The shutters had been driven in with an axe, and now the axe"
"19623",5230,"was descending in sweeping blows upon the window frame and the iron"
"19624",5230,"bars defending it. Then suddenly it leapt aside and vanished. He saw"
"19625",5230,"the revolver lying on the path outside, and then the little weapon"
"19626",5230,"sprang into the air. He dodged back. The revolver cracked just too"
"19627",5230,"late, and a splinter from the edge of the closing door flashed over his"
"19628",5230,"head. He slammed and locked the door, and as he stood outside he heard"
"19629",5230,"Griffin shouting and laughing. Then the blows of the axe with its"
"19630",5230,"splitting and smashing consequences, were resumed."
"19631",5230,""
"19632",5230,"Kemp stood in the passage trying to think. In a moment the Invisible"
"19633",5230,"Man would be in the kitchen. This door would not keep him a moment, and"
"19634",5230,"then—"
"19635",5230,""
"19636",5230,"A ringing came at the front door again. It would be the policemen. He"
"19637",5230,"ran into the hall, put up the chain, and drew the bolts. He made the"
"19638",5230,"girl speak before he dropped the chain, and the three people blundered"
"19639",5230,"into the house in a heap, and Kemp slammed the door again."
"19640",5230,""
"19641",5230,"“The Invisible Man!” said Kemp. “He has a revolver, with two"
"19642",5230,"shots—left. He’s killed Adye. Shot him anyhow. Didn’t you see him on"
"19643",5230,"the lawn? He’s lying there.”"
"19644",5230,""
"19645",5230,"“Who?” said one of the policemen."
"19646",5230,""
"19647",5230,"“Adye,” said Kemp."
"19648",5230,""
"19649",5230,"“We came in the back way,” said the girl."
"19650",5230,""
"19651",5230,"“What’s that smashing?” asked one of the policemen."
"19652",5230,""
"19653",5230,"“He’s in the kitchen—or will be. He has found an axe—”"
"19654",5230,""
"19655",5230,"Suddenly the house was full of the Invisible Man’s resounding blows on"
"19656",5230,"the kitchen door. The girl stared towards the kitchen, shuddered, and"
"19657",5230,"retreated into the dining-room. Kemp tried to explain in broken"
"19658",5230,"sentences. They heard the kitchen door give."
"19659",5230,""
"19660",5230,"“This way,” said Kemp, starting into activity, and bundled the"
"19661",5230,"policemen into the dining-room doorway."
"19662",5230,""
"19663",5230,"“Poker,” said Kemp, and rushed to the fender. He handed the poker he"
"19664",5230,"had carried to the policeman and the dining-room one to the other. He"
"19665",5230,"suddenly flung himself backward."
"19666",5230,""
"19667",5230,"“Whup!” said one policeman, ducked, and caught the axe on his poker."
"19668",5230,"The pistol snapped its penultimate shot and ripped a valuable Sidney"
"19669",5230,"Cooper. The second policeman brought his poker down on the little"
"19670",5230,"weapon, as one might knock down a wasp, and sent it rattling to the"
"19671",5230,"floor."
"19672",5230,""
"19673",5230,"At the first clash the girl screamed, stood screaming for a moment by"
"19674",5230,"the fireplace, and then ran to open the shutters—possibly with an idea"
"19675",5230,"of escaping by the shattered window."
"19676",5230,""
"19677",5230,"The axe receded into the passage, and fell to a position about two feet"
"19678",5230,"from the ground. They could hear the Invisible Man breathing. “Stand"
"19679",5230,"away, you two,” he said. “I want that man Kemp.”"
"19680",5230,""
"19681",5230,"“We want you,” said the first policeman, making a quick step forward"
"19682",5230,"and wiping with his poker at the Voice. The Invisible Man must have"
"19683",5230,"started back, and he blundered into the umbrella stand."
"19684",5230,""
"19685",5230,"Then, as the policeman staggered with the swing of the blow he had"
"19686",5230,"aimed, the Invisible Man countered with the axe, the helmet crumpled"
"19687",5230,"like paper, and the blow sent the man spinning to the floor at the head"
"19688",5230,"of the kitchen stairs. But the second policeman, aiming behind the axe"
"19689",5230,"with his poker, hit something soft that snapped. There was a sharp"
"19690",5230,"exclamation of pain and then the axe fell to the ground. The policeman"
"19691",5230,"wiped again at vacancy and hit nothing; he put his foot on the axe, and"
"19692",5230,"struck again. Then he stood, poker clubbed, listening intent for the"
"19693",5230,"slightest movement."

"19730",5230,""
"19731",5230,"Mr. Heelas, Mr. Kemp’s nearest neighbour among the villa holders, was"
"19732",5230,"asleep in his summer house when the siege of Kemp’s house began. Mr."
"19733",5230,"Heelas was one of the sturdy minority who refused to believe “in all"
"19734",5230,"this nonsense” about an Invisible Man. His wife, however, as he was"
"19735",5230,"subsequently to be reminded, did. He insisted upon walking about his"
"19736",5230,"garden just as if nothing was the matter, and he went to sleep in the"
"19737",5230,"afternoon in accordance with the custom of years. He slept through the"
"19738",5230,"smashing of the windows, and then woke up suddenly with a curious"
"19739",5230,"persuasion of something wrong. He looked across at Kemp’s house, rubbed"
"19740",5230,"his eyes and looked again. Then he put his feet to the ground, and sat"
"19741",5230,"listening. He said he was damned, but still the strange thing was"
"19742",5230,"visible. The house looked as though it had been deserted for"
"19743",5230,"weeks—after a violent riot. Every window was broken, and every window,"
"19744",5230,"save those of the belvedere study, was blinded by the internal"
"19745",5230,"shutters."
"19746",5230,""
"19747",5230,"“I could have sworn it was all right”—he looked at his watch—“twenty"

"19750",5230,"He became aware of a measured concussion and the clash of glass, far"
"19751",5230,"away in the distance. And then, as he sat open-mouthed, came a still"
"19752",5230,"more wonderful thing. The shutters of the drawing-room window were"
"19753",5230,"flung open violently, and the housemaid in her outdoor hat and"
"19754",5230,"garments, appeared struggling in a frantic manner to throw up the sash."
"19755",5230,"Suddenly a man appeared beside her, helping her—Dr. Kemp! In another"

"19757",5230,"pitched forward and vanished among the shrubs. Mr. Heelas stood up,"
"19758",5230,"exclaiming vaguely and vehemently at all these wonderful things. He saw"
"19759",5230,"Kemp stand on the sill, spring from the window, and reappear almost"
"19760",5230,"instantaneously running along a path in the shrubbery and stooping as"
"19761",5230,"he ran, like a man who evades observation. He vanished behind a"
"19762",5230,"laburnum, and appeared again clambering over a fence that abutted on"
"19763",5230,"the open down. In a second he had tumbled over and was running at a"
"19764",5230,"tremendous pace down the slope towards Mr. Heelas."

"19766",5230,"“Lord!” cried Mr. Heelas, struck with an idea; “it’s that Invisible Man"
"19767",5230,"brute! It’s right, after all!”"

"19769",5230,"With Mr. Heelas to think things like that was to act, and his cook"
"19770",5230,"watching him from the top window was amazed to see him come pelting"
"19771",5230,"towards the house at a good nine miles an hour. There was a slamming of"
"19772",5230,"doors, a ringing of bells, and the voice of Mr. Heelas bellowing like a"
"19773",5230,"bull. “Shut the doors, shut the windows, shut everything!—the Invisible"
"19774",5230,"Man is coming!” Instantly the house was full of screams and directions,"
"19775",5230,"and scurrying feet. He ran himself to shut the French windows that"
"19776",5230,"opened on the veranda; as he did so Kemp’s head and shoulders and knee"
"19777",5230,"appeared over the edge of the garden fence. In another moment Kemp had"
"19778",5230,"ploughed through the asparagus, and was running across the tennis lawn"

"19783",5230,""
"19784",5230,"Kemp appeared with a face of terror close to the glass, rapping and"
"19785",5230,"then shaking frantically at the French window. Then, seeing his efforts"
"19786",5230,"were useless, he ran along the veranda, vaulted the end, and went to"
"19787",5230,"hammer at the side door. Then he ran round by the side gate to the"
"19788",5230,"front of the house, and so into the hill-road. And Mr. Heelas staring"
"19789",5230,"from his window—a face of horror—had scarcely witnessed Kemp vanish,"
"19790",5230,"ere the asparagus was being trampled this way and that by feet unseen."
"19791",5230,"At that Mr. Heelas fled precipitately upstairs, and the rest of the"
"19792",5230,"chase is beyond his purview. But as he passed the staircase window, he"
"19793",5230,"heard the side gate slam."
"19794",5230,""
"19795",5230,"Emerging into the hill-road, Kemp naturally took the downward"
"19796",5230,"direction, and so it was he came to run in his own person the very race"
"19797",5230,"he had watched with such a critical eye from the belvedere study only"
"19798",5230,"four days ago. He ran it well, for a man out of training, and though"
"19799",5230,"his face was white and wet, his wits were cool to the last. He ran with"
"19800",5230,"wide strides, and wherever a patch of rough ground intervened, wherever"
"19801",5230,"there came a patch of raw flints, or a bit of broken glass shone"
"19802",5230,"dazzling, he crossed it and left the bare invisible feet that followed"
"19803",5230,"to take what line they would."
"19804",5230,""
"19805",5230,"For the first time in his life Kemp discovered that the hill-road was"
"19806",5230,"indescribably vast and desolate, and that the beginnings of the town"
"19807",5230,"far below at the hill foot were strangely remote. Never had there been"
"19808",5230,"a slower or more painful method of progression than running. All the"
"19809",5230,"gaunt villas, sleeping in the afternoon sun, looked locked and barred;"
"19810",5230,"no doubt they were locked and barred—by his own orders. But at any rate"
"19811",5230,"they might have kept a lookout for an eventuality like this! The town"
"19812",5230,"was rising up now, the sea had dropped out of sight behind it, and"
"19813",5230,"people down below were stirring. A tram was just arriving at the hill"
"19814",5230,"foot. Beyond that was the police station. Was that footsteps he heard"
"19815",5230,"behind him? Spurt."
"19816",5230,""
"19817",5230,"The people below were staring at him, one or two were running, and his"
"19818",5230,"breath was beginning to saw in his throat. The tram was quite near now,"
"19819",5230,"and the “Jolly Cricketers” was noisily barring its doors. Beyond the"
"19820",5230,"tram were posts and heaps of gravel—the drainage works. He had a"
"19821",5230,"transitory idea of jumping into the tram and slamming the doors, and"
"19822",5230,"then he resolved to go for the police station. In another moment he had"
"19823",5230,"passed the door of the “Jolly Cricketers,” and was in the blistering"
"19824",5230,"fag end of the street, with human beings about him. The tram driver and"
"19825",5230,"his helper—arrested by the sight of his furious haste—stood staring"
"19826",5230,"with the tram horses unhitched. Further on the astonished features of"
"19827",5230,"navvies appeared above the mounds of gravel."
"19828",5230,""
"19829",5230,"His pace broke a little, and then he heard the swift pad of his"
"19830",5230,"pursuer, and leapt forward again. “The Invisible Man!” he cried to the"
"19831",5230,"navvies, with a vague indicative gesture, and by an inspiration leapt"
"19832",5230,"the excavation and placed a burly group between him and the chase. Then"
"19833",5230,"abandoning the idea of the police station he turned into a little side"
"19834",5230,"street, rushed by a greengrocer’s cart, hesitated for the tenth of a"
"19835",5230,"second at the door of a sweetstuff shop, and then made for the mouth of"
"19836",5230,"an alley that ran back into the main Hill Street again. Two or three"
"19837",5230,"little children were playing here, and shrieked and scattered at his"
"19838",5230,"apparition, and forthwith doors and windows opened and excited mothers"
"19839",5230,"revealed their hearts. Out he shot into Hill Street again, three"
"19840",5230,"hundred yards from the tram-line end, and immediately he became aware"
"19841",5230,"of a tumultuous vociferation and running people."
"19842",5230,""
"19843",5230,"He glanced up the street towards the hill. Hardly a dozen yards off ran"
"19844",5230,"a huge navvy, cursing in fragments and slashing viciously with a spade,"
"19845",5230,"and hard behind him came the tram conductor with his fists clenched. Up"
"19846",5230,"the street others followed these two, striking and shouting. Down"
"19847",5230,"towards the town, men and women were running, and he noticed clearly"
"19848",5230,"one man coming out of a shop-door with a stick in his hand. “Spread"
"19849",5230,"out! Spread out!” cried some one. Kemp suddenly grasped the altered"
"19850",5230,"condition of the chase. He stopped, and looked round, panting. “He’s"
"19851",5230,"close here!” he cried. “Form a line across—”"
"19852",5230,""
"19853",5230,"He was hit hard under the ear, and went reeling, trying to face round"
"19854",5230,"towards his unseen antagonist. He just managed to keep his feet, and he"
"19855",5230,"struck a vain counter in the air. Then he was hit again under the jaw,"
"19856",5230,"and sprawled headlong on the ground. In another moment a knee"
"19857",5230,"compressed his diaphragm, and a couple of eager hands gripped his"
"19858",5230,"throat, but the grip of one was weaker than the other; he grasped the"
"19859",5230,"wrists, heard a cry of pain from his assailant, and then the spade of"
"19860",5230,"the navvy came whirling through the air above him, and struck something"
"19861",5230,"with a dull thud. He felt a drop of moisture on his face. The grip at"
"19862",5230,"his throat suddenly relaxed, and with a convulsive effort, Kemp loosed"
"19863",5230,"himself, grasped a limp shoulder, and rolled uppermost. He gripped the"
"19864",5230,"unseen elbows near the ground. “I’ve got him!” screamed Kemp. “Help!"
"19865",5230,"Help—hold! He’s down! Hold his feet!”"
"19866",5230,""
"19867",5230,"In another second there was a simultaneous rush upon the struggle, and"
"19868",5230,"a stranger coming into the road suddenly might have thought an"
"19869",5230,"exceptionally savage game of Rugby football was in progress. And there"
"19870",5230,"was no shouting after Kemp’s cry—only a sound of blows and feet and"
"19871",5230,"heavy breathing."
"19872",5230,""
"19873",5230,"Then came a mighty effort, and the Invisible Man threw off a couple of"
"19874",5230,"his antagonists and rose to his knees. Kemp clung to him in front like"
"19875",5230,"a hound to a stag, and a dozen hands gripped, clutched, and tore at the"
"19876",5230,"Unseen. The tram conductor suddenly got the neck and shoulders and"
"19877",5230,"lugged him back."
"19878",5230,""
"19879",5230,"Down went the heap of struggling men again and rolled over. There was,"
"19880",5230,"I am afraid, some savage kicking. Then suddenly a wild scream of"
"19881",5230,"“Mercy! Mercy!” that died down swiftly to a sound like choking."
"19882",5230,""
"19883",5230,"“Get back, you fools!” cried the muffled voice of Kemp, and there was a"
"19884",5230,"vigorous shoving back of stalwart forms. “He’s hurt, I tell you. Stand"
"19885",5230,"back!”"
"19886",5230,""
"19887",5230,"There was a brief struggle to clear a space, and then the circle of"
"19888",5230,"eager faces saw the doctor kneeling, as it seemed, fifteen inches in"
"19889",5230,"the air, and holding invisible arms to the ground. Behind him a"
"19890",5230,"constable gripped invisible ankles."
"19891",5230,""
"19892",5230,"“Don’t you leave go of en,” cried the big navvy, holding a"
"19893",5230,"blood-stained spade; “he’s shamming.”"
"19894",5230,""
"19895",5230,"“He’s not shamming,” said the doctor, cautiously raising his knee; “and"
"19896",5230,"I’ll hold him.” His face was bruised and already going red; he spoke"
"19897",5230,"thickly because of a bleeding lip. He released one hand and seemed to"
"19898",5230,"be feeling at the face. “The mouth’s all wet,” he said. And then, “Good"
"19899",5230,"God!”"
"19900",5230,""
"19901",5230,"He stood up abruptly and then knelt down on the ground by the side of"
"19902",5230,"the thing unseen. There was a pushing and shuffling, a sound of heavy"
"19903",5230,"feet as fresh people turned up to increase the pressure of the crowd."
"19904",5230,"People now were coming out of the houses. The doors of the “Jolly"
"19905",5230,"Cricketers” stood suddenly wide open. Very little was said."
"19906",5230,""
"19907",5230,"Kemp felt about, his hand seeming to pass through empty air. “He’s not"
"19908",5230,"breathing,” he said, and then, “I can’t feel his heart. His side—ugh!”"
"19909",5230,""
"19910",5230,"Suddenly an old woman, peering under the arm of the big navvy, screamed"
"19911",5230,"sharply. “Looky there!” she said, and thrust out a wrinkled finger."
"19912",5230,""
"19913",5230,"And looking where she pointed, everyone saw, faint and transparent as"
"19914",5230,"though it was made of glass, so that veins and arteries and bones and"
"19915",5230,"nerves could be distinguished, the outline of a hand, a hand limp and"
"19916",5230,"prone. It grew clouded and opaque even as they stared."
"19917",5230,""
"19918",5230,"“Hullo!” cried the constable. “Here’s his feet a-showing!”"
"19919",5230,""
"19920",5230,"And so, slowly, beginning at his hands and feet and creeping along his"
"19921",5230,"limbs to the vital centres of his body, that strange change continued."
"19922",5230,"It was like the slow spreading of a poison. First came the little white"
"19923",5230,"nerves, a hazy grey sketch of a limb, then the glassy bones and"
"19924",5230,"intricate arteries, then the flesh and skin, first a faint fogginess,"
"19925",5230,"and then growing rapidly dense and opaque. Presently they could see his"
"19926",5230,"crushed chest and his shoulders, and the dim outline of his drawn and"
"19927",5230,"battered features."
"19928",5230,""
"19929",5230,"When at last the crowd made way for Kemp to stand erect, there lay,"
"19930",5230,"naked and pitiful on the ground, the bruised and broken body of a young"
"19931",5230,"man about thirty. His hair and brow were white—not grey with age, but"
"19932",5230,"white with the whiteness of albinism—and his eyes were like garnets."
"19933",5230,"His hands were clenched, his eyes wide open, and his expression was one"
"19934",5230,"of anger and dismay."
"19935",5230,""
"19936",5230,"“Cover his face!” said a man. “For Gawd’s sake, cover that face!” and"
"19937",5230,"three little children, pushing forward through the crowd, were suddenly"
"19938",5230,"twisted round and sent packing off again."
"19939",5230,""
"19940",5230,"Someone brought a sheet from the “Jolly Cricketers,” and having covered"
"19941",5230,"him, they carried him into that house. And there it was, on a shabby"

"19954",5230,"Man. And if you would learn more of him you must go to a little inn"
"19955",5230,"near Port Stowe and talk to the landlord. The sign of the inn is an"
"19956",5230,"empty board save for a hat and boots, and the name is the title of this"
"19957",5230,"story. The landlord is a short and corpulent little man with a nose of"
"19958",5230,"cylindrical proportions, wiry hair, and a sporadic rosiness of visage."
"19959",5230,"Drink generously, and he will tell you generously of all the things"
"19960",5230,"that happened to him after that time, and of how the lawyers tried to"
"19961",5230,"do him out of the treasure found upon him."
"19962",5230,""
"19963",5230,"“When they found they couldn’t prove whose money was which, I’m"
"19964",5230,"blessed,” he says, “if they didn’t try to make me out a blooming"
"19965",5230,"treasure trove! Do I _look_ like a Treasure Trove? And then a gentleman"
"19966",5230,"gave me a guinea a night to tell the story at the Empire Music"

"19969",5230,"And if you want to cut off the flow of his reminiscences abruptly, you"
"19970",5230,"can always do so by asking if there weren’t three manuscript books in"

"19972",5230,"asseverations that everybody thinks _he_ has ’em! But bless you! he"
"19973",5230,"hasn’t. “The Invisible Man it was took ’em off to hide ’em when I cut"
"19974",5230,"and ran for Port Stowe. It’s that Mr. Kemp put people on with the idea"
"19975",5230,"of _my_ having ’em.”"
"19976",5230,""
"19977",5230,"And then he subsides into a pensive state, watches you furtively,"
"19978",5230,"bustles nervously with glasses, and presently leaves the bar."
"19979",5230,""
"19980",5230,"He is a bachelor man—his tastes were ever bachelor, and there are no"

"19982",5230,"in his more vital privacies, in the matter of braces for example, he"
"19983",5230,"still turns to string. He conducts his house without enterprise, but"
"19984",5230,"with eminent decorum. His movements are slow, and he is a great"
"19985",5230,"thinker. But he has a reputation for wisdom and for a respectable"
"19986",5230,"parsimony in the village, and his knowledge of the roads of the South"
"19987",5230,"of England would beat Cobbett."
"19988",5230,""
"19989",5230,"And on Sunday mornings, every Sunday morning, all the year round, while"

"19991",5230,"into his bar parlour, bearing a glass of gin faintly tinged with water,"
"19992",5230,"and having placed this down, he locks the door and examines the blinds,"
"19993",5230,"and even looks under the table. And then, being satisfied of his"
"19994",5230,"solitude, he unlocks the cupboard and a box in the cupboard and a"
"19995",5230,"drawer in that box, and produces three volumes bound in brown leather,"

"19999",5230,"The landlord sits down in an armchair, fills a long clay pipe"
"20000",5230,"slowly—gloating over the books the while. Then he pulls one towards him"
