"A SHIFTING REEF","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The year 1866 was signalised by a remarkable incident, a mysterious and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"puzzling phenomenon, which doubtless no one has yet forgotten. Not to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"mention rumours which agitated the maritime population and excited the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"public mind, even in the interior of continents, seafaring men were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"particularly excited. Merchants, common sailors, captains of vessels,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"skippers, both of Europe and America, naval officers of all countries,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and the Governments of several states on the two continents, were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"deeply interested in the matter.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"For some time past, vessels had been met by “an enormous thing,” a long","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"object, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, and infinitely","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The facts relating to this apparition (entered in various log-books)","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"agreed in most respects as to the shape of the object or creature in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"question, the untiring rapidity of its movements, its surprising power","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of locomotion, and the peculiar life with which it seemed endowed. If","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"it was a cetacean, it surpassed in size all those hitherto classified","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in science. Taking into consideration the mean of observations made at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"divers times,—rejecting the timid estimate of those who assigned to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"this object a length of two hundred feet, equally with the exaggerated","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"opinions which set it down as a mile in width and three in length,—we","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"might fairly conclude that this mysterious being surpassed greatly all","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"dimensions admitted by the ichthyologists of the day, if it existed at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"all. And that it _did_ exist was an undeniable fact; and, with that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"tendency which disposes the human mind in favour of the marvellous, we","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"can understand the excitement produced in the entire world by this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"supernatural apparition. As to classing it in the list of fables, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"idea was out of the question.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"On the 20th of July, 1866, the steamer _Governor Higginson_, of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Calcutta and Burnach Steam Navigation Company, had met this moving mass","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"five miles off the east coast of Australia. Captain Baker thought at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"first that he was in the presence of an unknown sandbank; he even","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"prepared to determine its exact position, when two columns of water,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"projected by the inexplicable object, shot with a hissing noise a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hundred and fifty feet up into the air. Now, unless the sandbank had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"been submitted to the intermittent eruption of a geyser, the _Governor","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Higginson_ had to do neither more nor less than with an aquatic mammal,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"unknown till then, which threw up from its blow-holes columns of water","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"mixed with air and vapour.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Similar facts were observed on the 23rd of July in the same year, in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the Pacific Ocean, by the _Columbus_, of the West India and Pacific","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Steam Navigation Company. But this extraordinary cetaceous creature","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"could transport itself from one place to another with surprising","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"velocity; as, in an interval of three days, the _Governor Higginson_","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and the _Columbus_ had observed it at two different points of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"chart, separated by a distance of more than seven hundred nautical","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"leagues.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Fifteen days later, two thousand miles farther off, the _Helvetia_, of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the Compagnie-Nationale, and the _Shannon_, of the Royal Mail Steamship","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Company, sailing to windward in that portion of the Atlantic lying","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"between the United States and Europe, respectively signalled the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"monster to each other in 42° 15′ N. lat. and 60° 35′ W. long. In these","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"simultaneous observations they thought themselves justified in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"estimating the minimum length of the mammal at more than three hundred","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and fifty feet, as the _Shannon_ and _Helvetia_ were of smaller","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"dimensions than it, though they measured three hundred feet over all.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Now the largest whales, those which frequent those parts of the sea","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"round the Aleutian, Kulammak, and Umgullich islands, have never","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"exceeded the length of sixty yards, if they attain that.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"These reports arriving one after the other, with fresh observations","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"made on board the transatlantic ship _Pereire_, a collision which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"occurred between the _Etna_ of the Inman line and the monster, a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_procès verbal_ directed by the officers of the French frigate","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Normandie_, a very accurate survey made by the staff of Commodore","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Fitz-James on board the _Lord Clyde_, greatly influenced public","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"opinion. Light-thinking people jested upon the phenomenon, but grave","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"practical countries, such as England, America, and Germany, treated the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"matter more seriously.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"In every place of great resort the monster was the fashion. They sang","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of it in the cafés, ridiculed it in the papers, and represented it on","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the stage. All kinds of stories were circulated regarding it. There","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"appeared in the papers caricatures of every gigantic and imaginary","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"creature, from the white whale, the terrible “Moby Dick” of hyperborean","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"regions, to the immense kraken whose tentacles could entangle a ship of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"five hundred tons, and hurry it into the abyss of the ocean. The","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"legends of ancient times were even resuscitated, and the opinions of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Aristotle and Pliny revived, who admitted the existence of these","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"monsters, as well as the Norwegian tales of Bishop Pontoppidan, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"accounts of Paul Heggede, and, last of all, the reports of Mr.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Harrington (whose good faith no one could suspect), who affirmed that,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"being on board the _Castillan_, in 1857, he had seen this enormous","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"serpent, which had never until that time frequented any other seas but","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"those of the ancient “_Constitutionnel_.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Then burst forth the interminable controversy between the credulous and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the incredulous in the societies of savants and the scientific","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"journals. “The question of the monster” inflamed all minds. Editors of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"scientific journals, quarrelling with believers in the supernatural,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"spilled seas of ink during this memorable campaign, some even drawing","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"blood; for, from the sea-serpent they came to direct personalities.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"For six months war was waged with various fortune in the leading","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"articles of the Geographical Institution of Brazil, the Royal Academy","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of Science of Berlin, the British Association, the Smithsonian","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Institution of Washington, in the discussions of the “Indian","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Archipelago,” of the Cosmos of the Abbé Moigno, in the Mittheilungen of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Petermann, in the scientific chronicles of the great journals of France","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and other countries. The cheaper journals replied keenly and with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"inexhaustible zest. These satirical writers parodied a remark of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Linnæus, quoted by the adversaries of the monster, maintaining “that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"nature did not make fools,” and adjured their contemporaries not to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"give the lie to nature, by admitting the existence of krakens,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sea-serpents, “Moby Dicks,” and other lucubrations of delirious","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sailors. At length an article in a well-known satirical journal by a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"favourite contributor, the chief of the staff, settled the monster,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"like Hippolytus, giving it the death-blow amidst an universal burst of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"laughter. Wit had conquered science.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"During the first months of the year 1867 the question seemed buried,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"never to revive, when new facts were brought before the public. It was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"then no longer a scientific problem to be solved, but a real danger","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"seriously to be avoided. The question took quite another shape. The","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"monster became a small island, a rock, a reef, but a reef of indefinite","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and shifting proportions.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"On the 5th of March, 1867, the _Moravian_, of the Montreal Ocean","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Company, finding herself during the night in 27° 30′ lat. and 72° 15′","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"long., struck on her starboard quarter a rock, marked in no chart for","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that part of the sea. Under the combined efforts of the wind and its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"four hundred horse-power, it was going at the rate of thirteen knots.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Had it not been for the superior strength of the hull of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Moravian_, she would have been broken by the shock and gone down with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the 237 passengers she was bringing home from Canada.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The accident happened about five o’clock in the morning, as the day was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"breaking. The officers of the quarter-deck hurried to the after-part of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the vessel. They examined the sea with the most scrupulous attention.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"They saw nothing but a strong eddy about three cables’ length distant,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"as if the surface had been violently agitated. The bearings of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"place were taken exactly, and the _Moravian_ continued its route","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"without apparent damage. Had it struck on a submerged rock, or on an","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"enormous wreck? they could not tell; but on examination of the ship’s","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"bottom when undergoing repairs, it was found that part of her keel was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"broken.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"This fact, so grave in itself, might perhaps have been forgotten like","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"many others if, three weeks after, it had not been re-enacted under","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"similar circumstances. But, thanks to the nationality of the victim of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the shock, thanks to the reputation of the company to which the vessel","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"belonged, the circumstance became extensively circulated.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The 13th of April, 1867, the sea being beautiful, the breeze","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"favourable, the _Scotia_, of the Cunard Company’s line, found herself","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in 15° 12′ long. and 45° 37′ lat. She was going at the speed of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"thirteen knots and a half.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At seventeen minutes past four in the afternoon, whilst the passengers","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"were assembled at lunch in the great saloon, a slight shock was felt on","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the hull of the _Scotia_, on her quarter, a little aft of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"port-paddle.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The _Scotia_ had not struck, but she had been struck, and seemingly by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"something rather sharp and penetrating than blunt. The shock had been","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"so slight that no one had been alarmed, had it not been for the shouts","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the carpenter’s watch, who rushed on to the bridge, exclaiming, “We","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"are sinking! we are sinking!” At first the passengers were much","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"frightened, but Captain Anderson hastened to reassure them. The danger","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"could not be imminent. The _Scotia_, divided into seven compartments by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"strong partitions, could brave with impunity any leak. Captain Anderson","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"went down immediately into the hold. He found that the sea was pouring","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"into the fifth compartment; and the rapidity of the influx proved that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the force of the water was considerable. Fortunately this compartment","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"did not hold the boilers, or the fires would have been immediately","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"extinguished. Captain Anderson ordered the engines to be stopped at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"once, and one of the men went down to ascertain the extent of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"injury. Some minutes afterwards they discovered the existence of a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"large hole, of two yards in diameter, in the ship’s bottom. Such a leak","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"could not be stopped; and the _Scotia_, her paddles half submerged, was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"obliged to continue her course. She was then three hundred miles from","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Cape Clear, and after three days’ delay, which caused great uneasiness","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in Liverpool, she entered the basin of the company.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The engineers visited the _Scotia_, which was put in dry dock. They","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"could scarcely believe it possible; at two yards and a half below","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"water-mark was a regular rent, in the form of an isosceles triangle.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The broken place in the iron plates was so perfectly defined that it","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"could not have been more neatly done by a punch. It was clear, then,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that the instrument producing the perforation was not of a common","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"stamp; and after having been driven with prodigious strength, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"piercing an iron plate 1-3/8 inches thick, had withdrawn itself by a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"retrograde motion truly inexplicable.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Such was the last fact, which resulted in exciting once more the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"torrent of public opinion. From this moment all unlucky casualties","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which could not be otherwise accounted for were put down to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"monster. Upon this imaginary creature rested the responsibility of all","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"these shipwrecks, which unfortunately were considerable; for of three","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"thousand ships whose loss was annually recorded at Lloyd’s, the number","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of sailing and steam ships supposed to be totally lost, from the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"absence of all news, amounted to not less than two hundred!","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Now, it was the “monster” who, justly or unjustly, was accused of their","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"disappearance, and, thanks to it, communication between the different","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"continents became more and more dangerous. The public demanded","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"peremptorily that the seas should at any price be relieved from this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"formidable cetacean.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"CHAPTER II","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"PRO AND CON","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At the period when these events took place, I had just returned from a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"scientific research in the disagreeable territory of Nebraska, in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"United States. In virtue of my office as Assistant Professor in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Museum of Natural History in Paris, the French Government had attached","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"me to that expedition. After six months in Nebraska, I arrived in New","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"York towards the end of March, laden with a precious collection. My","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"departure for France was fixed for the first days in May. Meanwhile, I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was occupying myself in classifying my mineralogical, botanical, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"zoological riches, when the accident happened to the _Scotia_.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I was perfectly up in the subject which was the question of the day.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"How could I be otherwise? I had read and re-read all the American and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"European papers without being any nearer a conclusion. This mystery","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"puzzled me. Under the impossibility of forming an opinion, I jumped","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"from one extreme to the other. That there really was something could","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"not be doubted, and the incredulous were invited to put their finger on","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the wound of the _Scotia_.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"On my arrival at New York the question was at its height. The","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hypothesis of the floating island, and the unapproachable sandbank,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"supported by minds little competent to form a judgment, was abandoned.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"And, indeed, unless this shoal had a machine in its stomach, how could","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"it change its position with such astonishing rapidity?","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"From the same cause, the idea of a floating hull of an enormous wreck","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was given up.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"There remained then only two possible solutions of the question, which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"created two distinct parties: on one side, those who were for a monster","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of colossal strength; on the other, those who were for a submarine","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"vessel of enormous motive power.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"But this last hypothesis, plausible as it was, could not stand against","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"inquiries made in both worlds. That a private gentleman should have","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"such a machine at his command was not likely. Where, when, and how was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"it built? and how could its construction have been kept secret?","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Certainly a Government might possess such a destructive machine. And in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"these disastrous times, when the ingenuity of man has multiplied the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"power of weapons of war, it was possible that, without the knowledge of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"others, a state might try to work such a formidable engine. After the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"chassepots came the torpedoes, after the torpedoes the submarine rams,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"then—the reaction. At least, I hope so.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"But the hypothesis of a war machine fell before the declaration of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Governments. As public interest was in question, and transatlantic","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"communications suffered, their veracity could not be doubted. But, how","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"admit that the construction of this submarine boat had escaped the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"public eye? For a private gentleman to keep the secret under such","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"circumstances would be very difficult, and for a state whose every act","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"is persistently watched by powerful rivals, certainly impossible.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"After inquiries made in England, France, Russia, Prussia, Spain, Italy,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and America, even in Turkey, the hypothesis of a submarine monitor was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"definitely rejected.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Upon my arrival in New York several persons did me the honour of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"consulting me on the phenomenon in question. I had published in France","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a work in quarto, in two volumes, entitled “Mysteries of the Great","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Submarine Grounds.” This book, highly approved of in the learned world,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"gained for me a special reputation in this rather obscure branch of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Natural History. My advice was asked. As long as I could deny the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"reality of the fact, I confined myself to a decided negative. But soon,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"finding myself driven into a corner, I was obliged to explain myself","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"categorically. And even “the Honourable Pierre Aronnax, Professor in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the Museum of Paris,” was called upon by the _New York Herald_ to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"express a definite opinion of some sort. I did something. I spoke, for","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"want of power to hold my tongue. I discussed the question in all its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"forms, politically and scientifically; and I give here an extract from","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a carefully-studied article which I published in the number of the 30th","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of April. It ran as follows:—","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“After examining one by one the different hypotheses, rejecting all","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"other suggestions, it becomes necessary to admit the existence of a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"marine animal of enormous power.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“The great depths of the ocean are entirely unknown to us. Soundings","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cannot reach them. What passes in those remote depths—what beings live,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"or can live, twelve or fifteen miles beneath the surface of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"waters—what is the organisation of these animals, we can scarcely","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"conjecture. However, the solution of the problem submitted to me may","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"modify the form of the dilemma. Either we do know all the varieties of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"beings which people our planet, or we do not. If we do _not_ know them","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"all—if Nature has still secrets in ichthyology for us, nothing is more","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"conformable to reason than to admit the existence of fishes, or","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cetaceans of other kinds, or even of new species, of an organisation","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"formed to inhabit the strata inaccessible to soundings, and which an","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"accident of some sort, either fatastical or capricious, has brought at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"long intervals to the upper level of the ocean.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“If, on the contrary, we _do_ know all living kinds, we must","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"necessarily seek for the animal in question amongst those marine beings","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"already classed; and, in that case, I should be disposed to admit the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"existence of a gigantic narwhal.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“The common narwhal, or unicorn of the sea, often attains a length of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sixty feet. Increase its size fivefold or tenfold, give it strength","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"proportionate to its size, lengthen its destructive weapons, and you","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"obtain the animal required. It will have the proportions determined by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the officers of the _Shannon_, the instrument required by the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"perforation of the _Scotia_, and the power necessary to pierce the hull","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the steamer.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Indeed, the narwhal is armed with a sort of ivory sword, a halberd,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"according to the expression of certain naturalists. The principal tusk","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"has the hardness of steel. Some of these tusks have been found buried","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in the bodies of whales, which the unicorn always attacks with success.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Others have been drawn out, not without trouble, from the bottoms of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ships, which they had pierced through and through, as a gimlet pierces","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a barrel. The Museum of the Faculty of Medicine of Paris possesses one","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of these defensive weapons, two yards and a quarter in length, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fifteen inches in diameter at the base.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Very well! suppose this weapon to be six times stronger and the animal","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ten times more powerful; launch it at the rate of twenty miles an hour,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and you obtain a shock capable of producing the catastrophe required.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Until further information, therefore, I shall maintain it to be a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sea-unicorn of colossal dimensions, armed not with a halberd, but with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a real spur, as the armoured frigates, or the ‘rams’ of war, whose","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"massiveness and motive power it would possess at the same time. Thus","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"may this puzzling phenomenon be explained, unless there be something","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"over and above all that one has ever conjectured, seen, perceived, or","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"experienced; which is just within the bounds of possibility.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"These last words were cowardly on my part; but, up to a certain point,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I wished to shelter my dignity as Professor, and not give too much","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cause for laughter to the Americans, who laugh well when they do laugh.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I reserved for myself a way of escape. In effect, however, I admitted","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the existence of the “monster.” My article was warmly discussed, which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"procured it a high reputation. It rallied round it a certain number of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"partisans. The solution it proposed gave, at least, full liberty to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"imagination. The human mind delights in grand conceptions of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"supernatural beings. And the sea is precisely their best vehicle, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"only medium through which these giants (against which terrestrial","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"animals, such as elephants or rhinoceroses, are as nothing) can be","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"produced or developed.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The industrial and commercial papers treated the question chiefly from","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"this point of view. The _Shipping and Mercantile Gazette_, the _Lloyd’s","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"List_, the _Packet-Boat_, and the _Maritime and Colonial Review_, all","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"papers devoted to insurance companies which threatened to raise their","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rates of premium, were unanimous on this point. Public opinion had been","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pronounced. The United States were the first in the field; and in New","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"York they made preparations for an expedition destined to pursue this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"narwhal. A frigate of great speed, the _Abraham Lincoln_, was put in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"commission as soon as possible. The arsenals were opened to Commander","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Farragut, who hastened the arming of his frigate; but, as it always","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"happens, the moment it was decided to pursue the monster, the monster","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"did not appear. For two months no one heard it spoken of. No ship met","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with it. It seemed as if this unicorn knew of the plots weaving around","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"it. It had been so much talked of, even through the Atlantic cable,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that jesters pretended that this slender fly had stopped a telegram on","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"its passage and was making the most of it.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"So when the frigate had been armed for a long campaign, and provided","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with formidable fishing apparatus, no one could tell what course to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pursue. Impatience grew apace, when, on the 2nd of July, they learned","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that a steamer of the line of San Francisco, from California to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Shanghai, had seen the animal three weeks before in the North Pacific","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Ocean. The excitement caused by this news was extreme. The ship was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"revictualled and well stocked with coal.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Three hours before the _Abraham Lincoln_ left Brooklyn pier, I received","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a letter worded as follows:—","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“To M. ARONNAX, Professor in the Museum of Paris, Fifth Avenue Hotel,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"New York.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“SIR,—If you will consent to join the _Abraham Lincoln_ in this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"expedition, the Government of the United States will with pleasure see","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"France represented in the enterprise. Commander Farragut has a cabin at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"your disposal.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Very cordially yours,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“J.B. HOBSON,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Secretary of Marine.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"CHAPTER III","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I FORM MY RESOLUTION","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Three seconds before the arrival of J. B. Hobson’s letter, I no more","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"thought of pursuing the unicorn than of attempting the passage of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"North Sea. Three seconds after reading the letter of the honourable","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Secretary of Marine, I felt that my true vocation, the sole end of my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"life, was to chase this disturbing monster, and purge it from the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"world.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"But I had just returned from a fatiguing journey, weary and longing for","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"repose. I aspired to nothing more than again seeing my country, my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"friends, my little lodging by the Jardin des Plantes, my dear and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"precious collections. But nothing could keep me back! I forgot","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"all—fatigue, friends and collections—and accepted without hesitation","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the offer of the American Government.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Besides,” thought I, “all roads lead back to Europe (for my particular","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"benefit), and I will not hurry me towards the coast of France. This","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"worthy animal may allow itself to be caught in the seas of Europe (for","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"my particular benefit), and I will not bring back less than half a yard","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of his ivory halberd to the Museum of Natural History.” But in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"meanwhile I must seek this narwhal in the North Pacific Ocean, which,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to return to France, was taking the road to the antipodes.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Conseil,” I called in an impatient voice.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Conseil was my servant, a true, devoted Flemish boy, who had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"accompanied me in all my travels. I liked him, and he returned the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"liking well. He was phlegmatic by nature, regular from principle,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"zealous from habit, evincing little disturbance at the different","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"surprises of life, very quick with his hands, and apt at any service","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"required of him; and, despite his name, never giving advice—even when","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"asked for it.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Conseil had followed me for the last ten years wherever science led.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Never once did he complain of the length or fatigue of a journey, never","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"make an objection to pack his portmanteau for whatever country it might","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"be, or however far away, whether China or Congo. Besides all this, he","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"had good health, which defied all sickness, and solid muscles, but no","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"nerves; good morals are understood. This boy was thirty years old, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"his age to that of his master as fifteen to twenty. May I be excused","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"for saying that I was forty years old?","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"But Conseil had one fault: he was ceremonious to a degree, and would","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"never speak to me but in the third person, which was sometimes","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"provoking.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Conseil,” said I again, beginning with feverish hands to make","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"preparations for my departure.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Certainly I was sure of this devoted boy. As a rule, I never asked him","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"if it were convenient for him or not to follow me in my travels; but","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"this time the expedition in question might be prolonged, and the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"enterprise might be hazardous in pursuit of an animal capable of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sinking a frigate as easily as a nutshell. Here there was matter for","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"reflection even to the most impassive man in the world. What would","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Conseil say?","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Conseil,” I called a third time.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Conseil appeared.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Did you call, sir?” said he, entering.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, my boy; make preparations for me and yourself too. We leave in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"two hours.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“As you please, sir,” replied Conseil, quietly.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Not an instant to lose;—lock in my trunk all travelling utensils,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"coats, shirts, and stockings—without counting, as many as you can, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"make haste.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“And your collections, sir?” observed Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“We will think of them by and by.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“What! the archiotherium, the hyracotherium, the oreodons, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cheropotamus, and the other skins?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“They will keep them at the hotel.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“And your live Babiroussa, sir?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“They will feed it during our absence; besides, I will give orders to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"forward our menagerie to France.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“We are not returning to Paris, then?” said Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Oh! certainly,” I answered, evasively, “by making a curve.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Will the curve please you, sir?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Oh! it will be nothing; not quite so direct a road, that is all. We","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"take our passage in the _Abraham Lincoln_.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“As you think proper, sir,” coolly replied Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“You see, my friend, it has to do with the monster—the famous narwhal.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"We are going to purge it from the seas. The author of a work in quarto","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in two volumes, on the ‘Mysteries of the Great Submarine Grounds’","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cannot forbear embarking with Commander Farragut. A glorious mission,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"but a dangerous one! We cannot tell where we may go; these animals can","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"be very capricious. But we will go whether or no; we have got a captain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"who is pretty wide-awake.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I opened a credit account for Babiroussa, and, Conseil following, I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"jumped into a cab. Our luggage was transported to the deck of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"frigate immediately. I hastened on board and asked for Commander","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Farragut. One of the sailors conducted me to the poop, where I found","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"myself in the presence of a good-looking officer, who held out his hand","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to me.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Monsieur Pierre Aronnax?” said he.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Himself,” replied I; “Commander Farragut?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“You are welcome, Professor; your cabin is ready for you.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I bowed, and desired to be conducted to the cabin destined for me.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The _Abraham Lincoln_ had been well chosen and equipped for her new","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"destination. She was a frigate of great speed, fitted with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"high-pressure engines which admitted a pressure of seven atmospheres.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Under this the _Abraham Lincoln_ attained the mean speed of nearly","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"eighteen knots and a third an hour—a considerable speed, but,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"nevertheless, insufficient to grapple with this gigantic cetacean.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The interior arrangements of the frigate corresponded to its nautical","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"qualities. I was well satisfied with my cabin, which was in the after","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"part, opening upon the gunroom.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“We shall be well off here,” said I to Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“As well, by your honour’s leave, as a hermit-crab in the shell of a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"whelk,” said Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I left Conseil to stow our trunks conveniently away, and remounted the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"poop in order to survey the preparations for departure.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At that moment Commander Farragut was ordering the last moorings to be","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cast loose which held the _Abraham Lincoln_ to the pier of Brooklyn. So","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in a quarter of an hour, perhaps less, the frigate would have sailed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"without me. I should have missed this extraordinary, supernatural, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"incredible expedition, the recital of which may well meet with some","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"scepticism.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"But Commander Farragut would not lose a day nor an hour in scouring the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"seas in which the animal had been sighted. He sent for the engineer.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Is the steam full on?” asked he.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, sir,” replied the engineer.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Go ahead,” cried Commander Farragut.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The quay of Brooklyn, and all that part of New York bordering on the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"East River, was crowded with spectators. Three cheers burst","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"successively from five hundred thousand throats; thousands of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"handkerchiefs were waved above the heads of the compact mass, saluting","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the _Abraham Lincoln_, until she reached the waters of the Hudson, at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the point of that elongated peninsula which forms the town of New York.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Then the frigate, following the coast of New Jersey along the right","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"bank of the beautiful river, covered with villas, passed between the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"forts, which saluted her with their heaviest guns. The _Abraham","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Lincoln_ answered by hoisting the American colours three times, whose","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"thirty-nine stars shone resplendent from the mizzen-peak; then","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"modifying its speed to take the narrow channel marked by buoys placed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in the inner bay formed by Sandy Hook Point, it coasted the long sandy","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"beach, where some thousands of spectators gave it one final cheer. The","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"escort of boats and tenders still followed the frigate, and did not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"leave her until they came abreast of the lightship, whose two lights","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"marked the entrance of New York Channel.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Six bells struck, the pilot got into his boat, and rejoined the little","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"schooner which was waiting under our lee, the fires were made up, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"screw beat the waves more rapidly, the frigate skirted the low yellow","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"coast of Long Island; and at eight bells, after having lost sight in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the north-west of the lights of Fire Island, she ran at full steam on","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to the dark waters of the Atlantic.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"CHAPTER IV","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"NED LAND","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Farragut was a good seaman, worthy of the frigate he commanded.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"His vessel and he were one. He was the soul of it. On the question of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the cetacean there was no doubt in his mind, and he would not allow the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"existence of the animal to be disputed on board. He believed in it, as","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"certain good women believe in the leviathan—by faith, not by reason.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The monster did exist, and he had sworn to rid the seas of it. He was a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"kind of Knight of Rhodes, a second Dieudonné de Gozon, going to meet","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the serpent which desolated the island. Either Captain Farragut would","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"kill the narwhal, or the narwhal would kill the captain. There was no","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"third course.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The officers on board shared the opinion of their chief. They were ever","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"chatting, discussing, and calculating the various chances of a meeting,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"watching narrowly the vast surface of the ocean. More than one took up","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"his quarters voluntarily in the cross-trees, who would have cursed such","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a berth under any other circumstances. As long as the sun described its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"daily course, the rigging was crowded with sailors, whose feet were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"burnt to such an extent by the heat of the deck as to render it","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"unbearable; still the _Abraham Lincoln_ had not yet breasted the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"suspected waters of the Pacific. As to the ship’s company, they desired","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"nothing better than to meet the unicorn, to harpoon it, hoist it on","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"board, and despatch it. They watched the sea with eager attention.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Besides, Captain Farragut had spoken of a certain sum of two thousand","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"dollars, set apart for whoever should first sight the monster, were he","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cabin-boy, common seaman, or officer.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I leave you to judge how eyes were used on board the _Abraham Lincoln_.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"For my own part I was not behind the others, and left to no one my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"share of daily observations. The frigate might have been called the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Argus_, for a hundred reasons. Only one amongst us, Conseil, seemed to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"protest by his indifference against the question which so interested us","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"all, and seemed to be out of keeping with the general enthusiasm on","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"board.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I have said that Captain Farragut had carefully provided his ship with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"every apparatus for catching the gigantic cetacean. No whaler had ever","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"been better armed. We possessed every known engine, from the harpoon","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"thrown by the hand to the barbed arrows of the blunderbuss, and the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"explosive balls of the duck-gun. On the forecastle lay the perfection","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of a breech-loading gun, very thick at the breech, and very narrow in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the bore, the model of which had been in the Exhibition of 1867. This","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"precious weapon of American origin could throw with ease a conical","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"projectile of nine pounds to a mean distance of ten miles.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Thus the _Abraham Lincoln_ wanted for no means of destruction; and,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"what was better still, she had on board Ned Land, the prince of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"harpooners.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Ned Land was a Canadian, with an uncommon quickness of hand, and who","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"knew no equal in his dangerous occupation. Skill, coolness, audacity,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and cunning he possessed in a superior degree, and it must be a cunning","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"whale or a singularly “cute” cachalot to escape the stroke of his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"harpoon.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Ned Land was about forty years of age; he was a tall man (more than six","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"feet high), strongly built, grave and taciturn, occasionally violent,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and very passionate when contradicted. His person attracted attention,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"but above all the boldness of his look, which gave a singular","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"expression to his face.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Who calls himself Canadian calls himself French; and, little","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"communicative as Ned Land was, I must admit that he took a certain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"liking for me. My nationality drew him to me, no doubt. It was an","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"opportunity for him to talk, and for me to hear, that old language of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Rabelais, which is still in use in some Canadian provinces. The","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"harpooner’s family was originally from Quebec, and was already a tribe","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of hardy fishermen when this town belonged to France.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Little by little, Ned Land acquired a taste for chatting, and I loved","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to hear the recital of his adventures in the polar seas. He related his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fishing, and his combats, with natural poetry of expression; his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"recital took the form of an epic poem, and I seemed to be listening to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a Canadian Homer singing the Iliad of the regions of the North.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I am portraying this hardy companion as I really knew him. We are old","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"friends now, united in that unchangeable friendship which is born and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cemented amidst extreme dangers. Ah, brave Ned! I ask no more than to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"live a hundred years longer, that I may have more time to dwell the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"longer on your memory.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Now, what was Ned Land’s opinion upon the question of the marine","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"monster? I must admit that he did not believe in the unicorn, and was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the only one on board who did not share that universal conviction. He","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"even avoided the subject, which I one day thought it my duty to press","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"upon him. One magnificent evening, the 30th of July—that is to say,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"three weeks after our departure—the frigate was abreast of Cape Blanc,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"thirty miles to leeward of the coast of Patagonia. We had crossed the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"tropic of Capricorn, and the Straits of Magellan opened less than seven","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hundred miles to the south. Before eight days were over the _Abraham","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Lincoln_ would be ploughing the waters of the Pacific.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Seated on the poop, Ned Land and I were chatting of one thing and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"another as we looked at this mysterious sea, whose great depths had up","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to this time been inaccessible to the eye of man. I naturally led up","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the conversation to the giant unicorn, and examined the various chances","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of success or failure of the expedition. But, seeing that Ned Land let","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"me speak without saying too much himself, I pressed him more closely.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well, Ned,” said I, “is it possible that you are not convinced of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"existence of this cetacean that we are following? Have you any","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"particular reason for being so incredulous?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The harpooner looked at me fixedly for some moments before answering,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"struck his broad forehead with his hand (a habit of his), as if to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"collect himself, and said at last, “Perhaps I have, Mr. Aronnax.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But, Ned, you, a whaler by profession, familiarised with all the great","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"marine mammalia—you, whose imagination might easily accept the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hypothesis of enormous cetaceans, _you_ ought to be the last to doubt","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"under such circumstances!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“That is just what deceives you, Professor,” replied Ned. “That the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"vulgar should believe in extraordinary comets traversing space, and in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the existence of antediluvian monsters in the heart of the globe, may","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"well be; but neither astronomer nor geologist believes in such","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"chimeras. As a whaler I have followed many a cetacean, harpooned a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"great number, and killed several; but, however strong or well-armed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"they may have been, neither their tails nor their weapons would have","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"been able even to scratch the iron plates of a steamer.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But, Ned, they tell of ships which the teeth of the narwhal have","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pierced through and through.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Wooden ships—that is possible,” replied the Canadian, “but I have","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"never seen it done; and, until further proof, I deny that whales,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cetaceans, or sea-unicorns could ever produce the effect you describe.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well, Ned, I repeat it with a conviction resting on the logic of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"facts. I believe in the existence of a mammal power fully organised,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"belonging to the branch of vertebrata, like the whales, the cachalots,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"or the dolphins, and furnished with a horn of defence of great","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"penetrating power.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Hum!” said the harpooner, shaking his head with the air of a man who","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"would not be convinced.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Notice one thing, my worthy Canadian,” I resumed. “If such an animal","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"is in existence, if it inhabits the depths of the ocean, if it","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"frequents the strata lying miles below the surface of the water, it","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"must necessarily possess an organisation the strength of which would","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"defy all comparison.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“And why this powerful organisation?” demanded Ned.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Because it requires incalculable strength to keep one’s self in these","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"strata and resist their pressure. Listen to me. Let us admit that the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pressure of the atmosphere is represented by the weight of a column of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"water thirty-two feet high. In reality the column of water would be","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shorter, as we are speaking of sea water, the density of which is","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"greater than that of fresh water. Very well, when you dive, Ned, as","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"many times thirty-two feet of water as there are above you, so many","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"times does your body bear a pressure equal to that of the atmosphere,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that is to say, 15 lbs. for each square inch of its surface. It","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"follows, then, that at 320 feet this pressure = that of 10 atmospheres,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of 100 atmospheres at 3200 feet, and of 1000 atmospheres at 32,000","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"feet, that is, about 6 miles; which is equivalent to saying that if you","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"could attain this depth in the ocean, each square three-eighths of an","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"inch of the surface of your body would bear a pressure of 5600 lbs. Ah!","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"my brave Ned, do you know how many square inches you carry on the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"surface of your body?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I have no idea, Mr. Aronnax.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“About 6500; and, as in reality the atmospheric pressure is about 15","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"lbs. to the square inch, your 6500 square inches bear at this moment a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pressure of 97,500 lbs.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Without my perceiving it?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Without your perceiving it. And if you are not crushed by such a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pressure, it is because the air penetrates the interior of your body","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with equal pressure. Hence perfect equilibrium between the interior and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"exterior pressure, which thus neutralise each other, and which allows","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"you to bear it without inconvenience. But in the water it is another","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"thing.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, I understand,” replied Ned, becoming more attentive; “because the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"water surrounds me, but does not penetrate.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Precisely, Ned: so that at 32 feet beneath the surface of the sea you","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"would undergo a pressure of 97,500 lbs.; at 320 feet, ten times that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pressure; at 3200 feet, a hundred times that pressure; lastly, at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"32,000 feet, a thousand times that pressure would be 97,500,000","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"lbs.—that is to say, that you would be flattened as if you had been","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"drawn from the plates of a hydraulic machine!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“The devil!” exclaimed Ned.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Very well, my worthy harpooner, if some vertebrate, several hundred","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"yards long, and large in proportion, can maintain itself in such","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"depths—of those whose surface is represented by millions of square","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"inches, that is by tens of millions of pounds, we must estimate the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pressure they undergo. Consider, then, what must be the resistance of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"their bony structure, and the strength of their organisation to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"withstand such pressure!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Why!” exclaimed Ned Land, “they must be made of iron plates eight","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"inches thick, like the armoured frigates.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“As you say, Ned. And think what destruction such a mass would cause,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"if hurled with the speed of an express train against the hull of a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"vessel.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes—certainly—perhaps,” replied the Canadian, shaken by these figures,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"but not yet willing to give in.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well, have I convinced you?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“You have convinced me of one thing, sir, which is that, if such","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"animals do exist at the bottom of the seas, they must necessarily be as","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"strong as you say.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But if they do not exist, mine obstinate harpooner, how explain the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"accident to the _Scotia?_”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"CHAPTER V","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"AT A VENTURE","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The voyage of the _Abraham Lincoln_ was for a long time marked by no","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"special incident. But one circumstance happened which showed the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"wonderful dexterity of Ned Land, and proved what confidence we might","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"place in him.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The 30th of June, the frigate spoke some American whalers, from whom we","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"learned that they knew nothing about the narwhal. But one of them, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"captain of the _Monroe_, knowing that Ned Land had shipped on board the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Abraham Lincoln_, begged for his help in chasing a whale they had in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sight. Commander Farragut, desirous of seeing Ned Land at work, gave","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"him permission to go on board the _Monroe_. And fate served our","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Canadian so well that, instead of one whale, he harpooned two with a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"double blow, striking one straight to the heart, and catching the other","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"after some minutes’ pursuit.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Decidedly, if the monster ever had to do with Ned Land’s harpoon, I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"would not bet in its favour.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The frigate skirted the south-east coast of America with great","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rapidity. The 3rd of July we were at the opening of the Straits of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Magellan, level with Cape Vierges. But Commander Farragut would not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"take a tortuous passage, but doubled Cape Horn.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The ship’s crew agreed with him. And certainly it was possible that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"they might meet the narwhal in this narrow pass. Many of the sailors","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"affirmed that the monster could not pass there, “that he was too big","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"for that!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The 6th of July, about three o’clock in the afternoon, the _Abraham","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Lincoln_, at fifteen miles to the south, doubled the solitary island,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"this lost rock at the extremity of the American continent, to which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"some Dutch sailors gave the name of their native town, Cape Horn. The","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"course was taken towards the north-west, and the next day the screw of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the frigate was at last beating the waters of the Pacific.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Keep your eyes open!” called out the sailors.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"And they were opened widely. Both eyes and glasses, a little dazzled,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"it is true, by the prospect of two thousand dollars, had not an","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"instant’s repose. Day and night they watched the surface of the ocean,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and even nyctalopes, whose faculty of seeing in the darkness multiplies","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"their chances a hundredfold, would have had enough to do to gain the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"prize.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I myself, for whom money had no charms, was not the least attentive on","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"board. Giving but few minutes to my meals, but a few hours to sleep,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"indifferent to either rain or sunshine, I did not leave the poop of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"vessel. Now leaning on the netting of the forecastle, now on the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"taffrail, I devoured with eagerness the soft foam which whitened the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sea as far as the eye could reach; and how often have I shared the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"emotion of the majority of the crew, when some capricious whale raised","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"its black back above the waves! The poop of the vessel was crowded in a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"moment. The cabins poured forth a torrent of sailors and officers, each","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with heaving breast and troubled eye watching the course of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cetacean. I looked and looked, till I was nearly blind, whilst Conseil,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"always phlegmatic, kept repeating in a calm voice:","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“If, sir, you would not squint so much, you would see better!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"But vain excitement! The _Abraham Lincoln_ checked its speed and made","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"for the animal signalled, a simple whale, or common cachalot, which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"soon disappeared amidst a storm of execration.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"But the weather was good. The voyage was being accomplished under the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"most favourable auspices. It was then the bad season in Australia, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"July of that zone corresponding to our January in Europe, but the sea","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was beautiful and easily scanned round a vast circumference.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The 20th of July, the tropic of Capricorn was cut by 105° of longitude,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and the 27th of the same month we crossed the equator on the 110th","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"meridian. This passed, the frigate took a more decided westerly","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"direction, and scoured the central waters of the Pacific. Commander","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Farragut thought, and with reason, that it was better to remain in deep","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"water, and keep clear of continents or islands, which the beast itself","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"seemed to shun (perhaps because there was not enough water for him!","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"suggested the greater part of the crew). The frigate passed at some","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"distance from the Marquesas and the Sandwich Islands, crossed the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"tropic of Cancer, and made for the China Seas. We were on the theatre","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the last diversions of the monster: and, to say truth, we no longer","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_lived_ on board. Hearts palpitated, fearfully preparing themselves for","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"future incurable aneurism. The entire ship’s crew were undergoing a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"nervous excitement, of which I can give no idea: they could not eat,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"they could not sleep—twenty times a day, a misconception or an optical","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"illusion of some sailor seated on the taffrail, would cause dreadful","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"perspirations, and these emotions, twenty times repeated, kept us in a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"state of excitement so violent that a reaction was unavoidable.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"And truly, reaction soon showed itself. For three months, during which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a day seemed an age, the _Abraham Lincoln_ furrowed all the waters of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the Northern Pacific, running at whales, making sharp deviations from","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"her course, veering suddenly from one tack to another, stopping","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"suddenly, putting on steam, and backing ever and anon at the risk of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"deranging her machinery, and not one point of the Japanese or American","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"coast was left unexplored.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The warmest partisans of the enterprise now became its most ardent","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"detractors. Reaction mounted from the crew to the captain himself, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"certainly, had it not been for resolute determination on the part of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Farragut, the frigate would have headed due southward. This","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"useless search could not last much longer. The _Abraham Lincoln_ had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"nothing to reproach herself with, she had done her best to succeed.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Never had an American ship’s crew shown more zeal or patience; its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"failure could not be placed to their charge—there remained nothing but","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to return.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"This was represented to the commander. The sailors could not hide their","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"discontent, and the service suffered. I will not say there was a mutiny","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"on board, but after a reasonable period of obstinacy, Captain Farragut","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"(as Columbus did) asked for three days’ patience. If in three days the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"monster did not appear, the man at the helm should give three turns of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the wheel, and the _Abraham Lincoln_ would make for the European seas.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"This promise was made on the 2nd of November. It had the effect of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rallying the ship’s crew. The ocean was watched with renewed attention.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Each one wished for a last glance in which to sum up his remembrance.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Glasses were used with feverish activity. It was a grand defiance given","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to the giant narwhal, and he could scarcely fail to answer the summons","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and “appear.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Two days passed, the steam was at half pressure; a thousand schemes","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"were tried to attract the attention and stimulate the apathy of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"animal in case it should be met in those parts. Large quantities of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"bacon were trailed in the wake of the ship, to the great satisfaction","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"(I must say) of the sharks. Small craft radiated in all directions","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"round the _Abraham Lincoln_ as she lay to, and did not leave a spot of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the sea unexplored. But the night of the 4th of November arrived","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"without the unveiling of this submarine mystery.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The next day, the 5th of November, at twelve, the delay would (morally","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"speaking) expire; after that time, Commander Farragut, faithful to his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"promise, was to turn the course to the south-east and abandon for ever","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the northern regions of the Pacific.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The frigate was then in 31° 15′ north latitude and 136° 42′ east","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"longitude. The coast of Japan still remained less than two hundred","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"miles to leeward. Night was approaching. They had just struck eight","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"bells; large clouds veiled the face of the moon, then in its first","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"quarter. The sea undulated peaceably under the stern of the vessel.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At that moment I was leaning forward on the starboard netting. Conseil,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"standing near me, was looking straight before him. The crew, perched in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the ratlines, examined the horizon, which contracted and darkened by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"degrees. Officers with their night glasses scoured the growing","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"darkness; sometimes the ocean sparkled under the rays of the moon,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which darted between two clouds, then all trace of light was lost in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the darkness.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"In looking at Conseil, I could see he was undergoing a little of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"general influence. At least I thought so. Perhaps for the first time","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"his nerves vibrated to a sentiment of curiosity.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Come, Conseil,” said I, “this is the last chance of pocketing the two","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"thousand dollars.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“May I be permitted to say, sir,” replied Conseil, “that I never","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"reckoned on getting the prize; and, had the government of the Union","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"offered a hundred thousand dollars, it would have been none the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"poorer.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“You are right, Conseil. It is a foolish affair after all, and one upon","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which we entered too lightly. What time lost, what useless emotions! We","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"should have been back in France six months ago.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“In your little room, sir,” replied Conseil, “and in your museum, sir,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and I should have already classed all your fossils, sir. And the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Babiroussa would have been installed in its cage in the Jardin des","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Plantes, and have drawn all the curious people of the capital!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“As you say, Conseil. I fancy we shall run a fair chance of being","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"laughed at for our pains.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“That’s tolerably certain,” replied Conseil, quietly; “I think they","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"will make fun of you, sir. And, must I say it?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Go on, my good friend.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well, sir, you will only get your deserts.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Indeed!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“When one has the honour of being a savant as you are, sir, one should","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"not expose one’s self to——”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Conseil had not time to finish his compliment. In the midst of general","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"silence a voice had just been heard. It was the voice of Ned Land","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shouting—","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Look out there! The very thing we are looking for—on our weather","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"beam!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"CHAPTER VI","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"AT FULL STEAM","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At this cry the whole ship’s crew hurried towards the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"harpooner,—commander, officers, masters, sailors, cabin boys; even the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"engineers left their engines, and the stokers their furnaces.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The order to stop her had been given, and the frigate now simply went","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"on by her own momentum. The darkness was then profound, and however","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"good the Canadian’s eyes were, I asked myself how he had managed to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"see, and what he had been able to see. My heart beat as if it would","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"break. But Ned Land was not mistaken, and we all perceived the object","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"he pointed to. At two cables’ length from the _Abraham Lincoln_, on the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"starboard quarter, the sea seemed to be illuminated all over. It was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"not a mere phosphoric phenomenon. The monster emerged some fathoms from","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the water, and then threw out that very intense but inexplicable light","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"mentioned in the report of several captains. This magnificent","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"irradiation must have been produced by an agent of great _shining_","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"power. The luminous part traced on the sea an immense oval, much","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"elongated, the centre of which condensed a burning heat, whose","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"overpowering brilliancy died out by successive gradations.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“It is only an agglomeration of phosphoric particles,” cried one of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"officers.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“No, sir, certainly not,” I replied. “Never did pholades or salpæ","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"produce such a powerful light. That brightness is of an essentially","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"electrical nature. Besides, see, see! it moves; it is moving forwards,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"backwards; it is darting towards us!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"A general cry rose from the frigate.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Silence!” said the Captain; “up with the helm, reverse the engines.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The steam was shut off, and the _Abraham Lincoln_, beating to port,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"described a semicircle.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Right the helm, go ahead,” cried the Captain.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"These orders were executed, and the frigate moved rapidly from the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"burning light.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I was mistaken. She tried to sheer off, but the supernatural animal","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"approached with a velocity double her own.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"We gasped for breath. Stupefaction more than fear made us dumb and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"motionless. The animal gained on us, sporting with the waves. It made","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the round of the frigate, which was then making fourteen knots, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"enveloped it with its electric rings like luminous dust. Then it moved","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"away two or three miles, leaving a phosphorescent track, like those","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"volumes of steam that the express trains leave behind. All at once from","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the dark line of the horizon whither it retired to gain its momentum,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the monster rushed suddenly towards the _Abraham Lincoln_ with alarming","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rapidity, stopped suddenly about twenty feet from the hull, and died","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"out,—not diving under the water, for its brilliancy did not abate,—but","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"suddenly, and as if the source of this brilliant emanation was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"exhausted. Then it reappeared on the other side of the vessel, as if it","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"had turned and slid under the hull. Any moment a collision might have","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"occurred which would have been fatal to us. However, I was astonished","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"at the manœuvres of the frigate. She fled and did not attack.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"On the captain’s face, generally so impassive, was an expression of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"unaccountable astonishment.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Mr. Aronnax,” he said, “I do not know with what formidable being I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"have to deal, and I will not imprudently risk my frigate in the midst","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of this darkness. Besides, how attack this unknown thing, how defend","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"one’s self from it? Wait for daylight, and the scene will change.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“You have no further doubt, captain, of the nature of the animal?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“No, sir; it is evidently a gigantic narwhal, and an electric one.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Perhaps,” added I, “one can only approach it with a gymnotus or a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"torpedo.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Undoubtedly,” replied the captain, “if it possesses such dreadful","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"power, it is the most terrible animal that ever was created. That is","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"why, sir, I must be on my guard.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The crew were on their feet all night. No one thought of sleep. The","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Abraham Lincoln_, not being able to struggle with such velocity, had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"moderated its pace, and sailed at half speed. For its part, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"narwhal, imitating the frigate, let the waves rock it at will, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"seemed decided not to leave the scene of the struggle. Towards","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"midnight, however, it disappeared, or, to use a more appropriate term,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"it “died out” like a large glow-worm. Had it fled? One could only fear,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"not hope. But at seven minutes to one o’clock in the morning a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"deafening whistling was heard, like that produced by a body of water","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rushing with great violence.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The captain, Ned Land, and I, were then on the poop, eagerly peering","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"through the profound darkness.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Ned Land,” asked the commander, “you have often heard the roaring of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"whales?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Often, sir; but never such whales the sight of which brought me in two","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"thousand dollars. If I can only approach within four harpoon lengths of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"it!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But to approach it,” said the commander, “I ought to put a whaler at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"your disposal?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Certainly, sir.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“That will be trifling with the lives of my men.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“And mine too,” simply said the harpooner.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Towards two o’clock in the morning, the burning light reappeared, not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"less intense, about five miles to windward of the _Abraham Lincoln_.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Notwithstanding the distance, and the noise of the wind and sea, one","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"heard distinctly the loud strokes of the animal’s tail, and even its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"panting breath. It seemed that, at the moment that the enormous narwhal","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"had come to take breath at the surface of the water, the air was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"engulfed in its lungs, like the steam in the vast cylinders of a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"machine of two thousand horse-power.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Hum!” thought I, “a whale with the strength of a cavalry regiment","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"would be a pretty whale!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"We were on the _qui vive_ till daylight, and prepared for the combat.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The fishing implements were laid along the hammock nettings. The second","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"lieutenant loaded the blunderbusses, which could throw harpoons to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"distance of a mile, and long duck-guns, with explosive bullets, which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"inflicted mortal wounds even to the most terrible animals. Ned Land","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"contented himself with sharpening his harpoon—a terrible weapon in his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hands.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At six o’clock day began to break; and, with the first glimmer of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"light, the electric light of the narwhal disappeared. At seven o’clock","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the day was sufficiently advanced, but a very thick sea fog obscured","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"our view, and the best spy-glasses could not pierce it. That caused","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"disappointment and anger.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I climbed the mizzen-mast. Some officers were already perched on the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"mast heads. At eight o’clock the fog lay heavily on the waves, and its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"thick scrolls rose little by little. The horizon grew wider and clearer","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"at the same time. Suddenly, just as on the day before, Ned Land’s voice","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was heard:","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“The thing itself on the port quarter!” cried the harpooner.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Every eye was turned towards the point indicated. There, a mile and a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"half from the frigate, a long blackish body emerged a yard above the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"waves. Its tail, violently agitated, produced a considerable eddy.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Never did a caudal appendage beat the sea with such violence. An","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"immense track, of dazzling whiteness, marked the passage of the animal,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and described a long curve.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The frigate approached the cetacean. I examined it thoroughly.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The reports of the _Shannon_ and of the _Helvetia_ had rather","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"exaggerated its size, and I estimated its length at only two hundred","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and fifty feet. As to its dimensions, I could only conjecture them to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"be admirably proportioned. While I watched this phenomenon, two jets of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"steam and water were ejected from its vents, and rose to the height of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"120 feet; thus I ascertained its way of breathing. I concluded","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"definitely that it belonged to the vertebrate branch, class mammalia.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The crew waited impatiently for their chief’s orders. The latter, after","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"having observed the animal attentively, called the engineer. The","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"engineer ran to him.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Sir,” said the commander, “you have steam up?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, sir,” answered the engineer.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well, make up your fires and put on all steam.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Three hurrahs greeted this order. The time for the struggle had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"arrived. Some moments after, the two funnels of the frigate vomited","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"torrents of black smoke, and the bridge quaked under the trembling of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the boilers.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The _Abraham Lincoln_, propelled by her wonderful screw, went straight","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"at the animal. The latter allowed it to come within half a cable’s","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"length; then, as if disdaining to dive, it took a little turn, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"stopped a short distance off.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"This pursuit lasted nearly three-quarters of an hour, without the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"frigate gaining two yards on the cetacean. It was quite evident that at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that rate we should never come up with it.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well, Mr. Land,” asked the captain, “do you advise me to put the boats","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"out to sea?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“No, sir,” replied Ned Land; “because we shall not take that beast","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"easily.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“What shall we do then?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Put on more steam if you can, sir. With your leave, I mean to post","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"myself under the bowsprit, and if we get within harpooning distance, I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shall throw my harpoon.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Go, Ned,” said the captain. “Engineer, put on more pressure.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Ned Land went to his post. The fires were increased, the screw revolved","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"forty-three times a minute, and the steam poured out of the valves. We","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"heaved the log, and calculated that the _Abraham Lincoln_ was going at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the rate of 18½ miles an hour.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"But the accursed animal swam too at the rate of 18½ miles an hour.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"For a whole hour, the frigate kept up this pace, without gaining six","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"feet. It was humiliating for one of the swiftest sailers in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"American navy. A stubborn anger seized the crew; the sailors abused the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"monster, who, as before, disdained to answer them; the captain no","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"longer contented himself with twisting his beard—he gnawed it.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The engineer was again called.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“You have turned full steam in?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, sir,” replied the engineer.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The speed of the _Abraham Lincoln_ increased. Its masts trembled down","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to their stepping holes, and the clouds of smoke could hardly find way","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"out of the narrow funnels.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"They heaved the log a second time.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well?” asked the captain of the man at the wheel.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Nineteen miles and three-tenths, sir.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Clap on more steam.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The engineer obeyed. The manometer showed ten degrees. But the cetacean","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"grew warm itself, no doubt; for without straining itself, it made","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"19-3/10 miles.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"What a pursuit! No, I cannot describe the emotion that vibrated through","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"me. Ned Land kept his post, harpoon in hand. Several times the animal","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"let us gain upon it.—“We shall catch it! we shall catch it!” cried the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Canadian. But just as he was going to strike, the cetacean stole away","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with a rapidity that could not be estimated at less than thirty miles","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"an hour, and even during our maximum of speed, it bullied the frigate,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"going round and round it. A cry of fury broke from everyone!","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At noon we were no further advanced than at eight o’clock in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"morning.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The captain then decided to take more direct means.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Ah!” said he, “that animal goes quicker than the _Abraham Lincoln_.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Very well! we will see whether it will escape these conical bullets.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Send your men to the forecastle, sir.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The forecastle gun was immediately loaded and slewed round. But the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shot passed some feet above the cetacean, which was half a mile off.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Another, more to the right,” cried the commander, “and five dollars to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"whoever will hit that infernal beast.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"An old gunner with a grey beard—that I can see now—with steady eye and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"grave face, went up to the gun and took a long aim. A loud report was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"heard, with which were mingled the cheers of the crew.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"[Illustration] An old grey-bearded gunner . . . .","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The bullet did its work; it hit the animal, but not fatally, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sliding off the rounded surface, was lost in two miles depth of sea.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The chase began again, and the captain, leaning towards me, said—","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I will pursue that beast till my frigate bursts up.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes,” answered I; “and you will be quite right to do it.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I wished the beast would exhaust itself, and not be insensible to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fatigue like a steam engine! But it was of no use. Hours passed,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"without its showing any signs of exhaustion.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"However, it must be said in praise of the _Abraham Lincoln_, that she","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"struggled on indefatigably. I cannot reckon the distance she made under","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"three hundred miles during this unlucky day, November the 6th. But","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"night came on, and overshadowed the rough ocean.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Now I thought our expedition was at an end, and that we should never","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"again see the extraordinary animal. I was mistaken. At ten minutes to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"eleven in the evening, the electric light reappeared three miles to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"windward of the frigate, as pure, as intense as during the preceding","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"night.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The narwhal seemed motionless; perhaps, tired with its day’s work, it","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"slept, letting itself float with the undulation of the waves. Now was a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"chance of which the captain resolved to take advantage.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"He gave his orders. The _Abraham Lincoln_ kept up half steam, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"advanced cautiously so as not to awake its adversary. It is no rare","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"thing to meet in the middle of the ocean whales so sound asleep that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"they can be successfully attacked, and Ned Land had harpooned more than","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"one during its sleep. The Canadian went to take his place again under","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the bowsprit.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The frigate approached noiselessly, stopped at two cables’ lengths from","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the animal, and following its track. No one breathed; a deep silence","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"reigned on the bridge. We were not a hundred feet from the burning","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"focus, the light of which increased and dazzled our eyes.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At this moment, leaning on the forecastle bulwark, I saw below me Ned","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Land grappling the martingale in one hand, brandishing his terrible","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"harpoon in the other, scarcely twenty feet from the motionless animal.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Suddenly his arm straightened, and the harpoon was thrown; I heard the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sonorous stroke of the weapon, which seemed to have struck a hard body.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The electric light went out suddenly, and two enormous waterspouts","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"broke over the bridge of the frigate, rushing like a torrent from stem","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to stern, overthrowing men, and breaking the lashings of the spars. A","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fearful shock followed, and, thrown over the rail without having time","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to stop myself, I fell into the sea.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"CHAPTER VII","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"AN UNKNOWN SPECIES OF WHALE","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"This unexpected fall so stunned me that I have no clear recollection of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"my sensations at the time. I was at first drawn down to a depth of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"about twenty feet. I am a good swimmer (though without pretending to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rival Byron or Edgar Poe, who were masters of the art), and in that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"plunge I did not lose my presence of mind. Two vigorous strokes brought","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"me to the surface of the water. My first care was to look for the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"frigate. Had the crew seen me disappear? Had the _Abraham Lincoln_","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"veered round? Would the captain put out a boat? Might I hope to be","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"saved?","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The darkness was intense. I caught a glimpse of a black mass","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"disappearing in the east, its beacon lights dying out in the distance.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"It was the frigate! I was lost.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Help, help!” I shouted, swimming towards the _Abraham Lincoln_ in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"desperation.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"My clothes encumbered me; they seemed glued to my body, and paralysed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"my movements.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I was sinking! I was suffocating!","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Help!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"This was my last cry. My mouth filled with water; I struggled against","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"being drawn down the abyss. Suddenly my clothes were seized by a strong","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hand, and I felt myself quickly drawn up to the surface of the sea; and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I heard, yes, I heard these words pronounced in my ear—","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“If master would be so good as to lean on my shoulder, master would","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"swim with much greater ease.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I seized with one hand my faithful Conseil’s arm.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Is it you?” said I, “you?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Myself,” answered Conseil; “and waiting master’s orders.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“That shock threw you as well as me into the sea?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“No; but being in my master’s service, I followed him.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The worthy fellow thought that was but natural.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“And the frigate?” I asked.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“The frigate?” replied Conseil, turning on his back; “I think that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"master had better not count too much on her.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“You think so?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I say that, at the time I threw myself into the sea, I heard the men","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"at the wheel say, ‘The screw and the rudder are broken.’”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Broken?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, broken by the monster’s teeth. It is the only injury the _Abraham","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Lincoln_ has sustained. But it is a bad look out for us—she no longer","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"answers her helm.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Then we are lost!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Perhaps so,” calmly answered Conseil. “However, we have still several","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hours before us, and one can do a good deal in some hours.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Conseil’s imperturbable coolness set me up again. I swam more","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"vigorously; but, cramped by my clothes, which stuck to me like a leaden","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"weight, I felt great difficulty in bearing up. Conseil saw this.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Will master let me make a slit?” said he; and, slipping an open knife","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"under my clothes, he ripped them up from top to bottom very rapidly.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Then he cleverly slipped them off me, while I swam for both of us.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Then I did the same for Conseil, and we continued to swim near to each","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"other.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Nevertheless, our situation was no less terrible. Perhaps our","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"disappearance had not been noticed; and if it had been, the frigate","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"could not tack, being without its helm. Conseil argued on this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"supposition, and laid his plans accordingly. This phlegmatic boy was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"perfectly self-possessed. We then decided that, as our only chance of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"safety was being picked up by the _Abraham Lincoln’s_ boats, we ought","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to manage so as to wait for them as long as possible. I resolved then","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to husband our strength, so that both should not be exhausted at the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"same time; and this is how we managed: while one of us lay on our back,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"quite still, with arms crossed, and legs stretched out, the other would","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"swim and push the other on in front. This towing business did not last","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"more than ten minutes each; and relieving each other thus, we could","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"swim on for some hours, perhaps till daybreak. Poor chance! but hope is","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"so firmly rooted in the heart of man! Moreover, there were two of us.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Indeed I declare (though it may seem improbable) if I sought to destroy","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"all hope,—if I wished to despair, I could not.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The collision of the frigate with the cetacean had occurred about","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"eleven o’clock the evening before. I reckoned then we should have eight","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hours to swim before sunrise, an operation quite practicable if we","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"relieved each other. The sea, very calm, was in our favour. Sometimes I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"tried to pierce the intense darkness that was only dispelled by the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"phosphorescence caused by our movements. I watched the luminous waves","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that broke over my hand, whose mirror-like surface was spotted with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"silvery rings. One might have said that we were in a bath of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"quicksilver.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Near one o’clock in the morning, I was seized with dreadful fatigue. My","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"limbs stiffened under the strain of violent cramp. Conseil was obliged","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to keep me up, and our preservation devolved on him alone. I heard the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"poor boy pant; his breathing became short and hurried. I found that he","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"could not keep up much longer.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Leave me! leave me!” I said to him.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Leave my master? Never!” replied he. “I would drown first.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Just then the moon appeared through the fringes of a thick cloud that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the wind was driving to the east. The surface of the sea glittered with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"its rays. This kindly light reanimated us. My head got better again. I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"looked at all points of the horizon. I saw the frigate! She was five","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"miles from us, and looked like a dark mass, hardly discernible. But no","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"boats!","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I would have cried out. But what good would it have been at such a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"distance! My swollen lips could utter no sounds. Conseil could","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"articulate some words, and I heard him repeat at intervals, “Help!","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"help!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Our movements were suspended for an instant; we listened. It might be","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"only a singing in the ear, but it seemed to me as if a cry answered the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cry from Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Did you hear?” I murmured.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes! Yes!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"And Conseil gave one more despairing call.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"This time there was no mistake! A human voice responded to ours! Was it","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the voice of another unfortunate creature, abandoned in the middle of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the ocean, some other victim of the shock sustained by the vessel? Or","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rather was it a boat from the frigate, that was hailing us in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"darkness?","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Conseil made a last effort, and, leaning on my shoulder, while I struck","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"out in a despairing effort, he raised himself half out of the water,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"then fell back exhausted.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“What did you see?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I saw”—murmured he; “I saw—but do not talk—reserve all your strength!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"What had he seen? Then, I know not why, the thought of the monster came","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"into my head for the first time! But that voice! The time is past for","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Jonahs to take refuge in whales’ bellies! However, Conseil was towing","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"me again. He raised his head sometimes, looked before us, and uttered a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cry of recognition, which was responded to by a voice that came nearer","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and nearer. I scarcely heard it. My strength was exhausted; my fingers","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"stiffened; my hand afforded me support no longer; my mouth,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"convulsively opening, filled with salt water. Cold crept over me. I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"raised my head for the last time, then I sank.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At this moment a hard body struck me. I clung to it: then I felt that I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was being drawn up, that I was brought to the surface of the water,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that my chest collapsed:—I fainted.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"It is certain that I soon came to, thanks to the vigorous rubbings that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I received. I half opened my eyes.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Conseil!” I murmured.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Does master call me?” asked Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Just then, by the waning light of the moon which was sinking down to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the horizon, I saw a face which was not Conseil’s and which I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"immediately recognised.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Ned!” I cried.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“The same, sir, who is seeking his prize!” replied the Canadian.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Were you thrown into the sea by the shock to the frigate?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, Professor; but more fortunate than you, I was able to find a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"footing almost directly upon a floating island.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“An island?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Or, more correctly speaking, on our gigantic narwhal.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Explain yourself, Ned!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Only I soon found out why my harpoon had not entered its skin and was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"blunted.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Why, Ned, why?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Because, Professor, that beast is made of sheet iron.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The Canadian’s last words produced a sudden revolution in my brain. I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"wriggled myself quickly to the top of the being, or object, half out of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the water, which served us for a refuge. I kicked it. It was evidently","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a hard impenetrable body, and not the soft substance that forms the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"bodies of the great marine mammalia. But this hard body might be a bony","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"carapace, like that of the antediluvian animals; and I should be free","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to class this monster among amphibious reptiles, such as tortoises or","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"alligators.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Well, no! the blackish back that supported me was smooth, polished,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"without scales. The blow produced a metallic sound; and incredible","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"though it may be, it seemed, I might say, as if it was made of riveted","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"plates.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"There was no doubt about it! This monster, this natural phenomenon that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"had puzzled the learned world, and overthrown and misled the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"imagination of seamen of both hemispheres, it must be owned, a still","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"more astonishing phenomenon, inasmuch as it was a simply human","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"construction.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"We had no time to lose, however. We were lying upon the back of a sort","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of submarine boat, which appeared (as far as I could judge) like a huge","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fish of steel. Ned Land’s mind was made up on this point. Conseil and I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"could only agree with him.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Just then a bubbling began at the back of this strange thing (which was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"evidently propelled by a screw), and it began to move. We had only just","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"time to seize hold of the upper part, which rose about seven feet out","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the water, and happily its speed was not great.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“As long as it sails horizontally,” muttered Ned Land, “I do not mind;","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"but if it takes a fancy to dive, I would not give two straws for my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"life.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The Canadian might have said still less. It became really necessary to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"communicate with the beings, whatever they were, shut up inside the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"machine. I searched all over the outside for an aperture, a panel, or a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"man-hole, to use a technical expression; but the lines of the iron","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rivets, solidly driven into the joints of the iron plates, were clear","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and uniform. Besides, the moon disappeared then, and left us in total","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"darkness.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At last this long night passed. My indistinct remembrance prevents my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"describing all the impressions it made. I can only recall one","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"circumstance. During some lulls of the wind and sea, I fancied I heard","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"several times vague sounds, a sort of fugitive harmony produced by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"words of command. What was then the mystery of this submarine craft, of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which the whole world vainly sought an explanation? What kind of beings","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"existed in this strange boat? What mechanical agent caused its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"prodigious speed?","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Daybreak appeared. The morning mists surrounded us, but they soon","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cleared off. I was about to examine the hull, which formed on deck a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"kind of horizontal platform, when I felt it gradually sinking.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Oh! confound it!” cried Ned Land, kicking the resounding plate. “Open,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"you inhospitable rascals!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Happily the sinking movement ceased. Suddenly a noise, like iron works","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"violently pushed aside, came from the interior of the boat. One iron","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"plate was moved, a man appeared, uttered an odd cry, and disappeared","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"immediately.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Some moments after, eight strong men, with masked faces, appeared","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"noiselessly, and drew us down into their formidable machine.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"CHAPTER VIII","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"MOBILIS IN MOBILI","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"This forcible abduction, so roughly carried out, was accomplished with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the rapidity of lightning. I shivered all over. Whom had we to deal","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with? No doubt some new sort of pirates, who explored the sea in their","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"own way.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Hardly had the narrow panel closed upon me, when I was enveloped in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"darkness. My eyes, dazzled with the outer light, could distinguish","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"nothing. I felt my naked feet cling to the rungs of an iron ladder. Ned","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Land and Conseil, firmly seized, followed me. At the bottom of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ladder, a door opened, and shut after us immediately with a bang.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"We were alone. Where, I could not say, hardly imagine. All was black,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and such a dense black that, after some minutes, my eyes had not been","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"able to discern even the faintest glimmer.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Meanwhile, Ned Land, furious at these proceedings, gave free vent to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"his indignation.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Confound it!” cried he, “here are people who come up to the Scotch for","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hospitality. They only just miss being cannibals. I should not be","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"surprised at it, but I declare that they shall not eat me without my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"protesting.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Calm yourself, friend Ned, calm yourself,” replied Conseil, quietly.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Do not cry out before you are hurt. We are not quite done for yet.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Not quite,” sharply replied the Canadian, “but pretty near, at all","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"events. Things look black. Happily, my bowie knife I have still, and I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"can always see well enough to use it. The first of these pirates who","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"lays a hand on me——”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Do not excite yourself, Ned,” I said to the harpooner, “and do not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"compromise us by useless violence. Who knows that they will not listen","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to us? Let us rather try to find out where we are.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I groped about. In five steps I came to an iron wall, made of plates","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"bolted together. Then turning back I struck against a wooden table,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"near which were ranged several stools. The boards of this prison were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"concealed under a thick mat of phormium, which deadened the noise of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the feet. The bare walls revealed no trace of window or door. Conseil,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"going round the reverse way, met me, and we went back to the middle of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the cabin, which measured about twenty feet by ten. As to its height,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Ned Land, in spite of his own great height, could not measure it.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Half an hour had already passed without our situation being bettered,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"when the dense darkness suddenly gave way to extreme light. Our prison","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was suddenly lighted—that is to say, it became filled with a luminous","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"matter, so strong that I could not bear it at first. In its whiteness","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and intensity I recognised that electric light which played round the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"submarine boat like a magnificent phenomenon of phosphorescence. After","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shutting my eyes involuntarily, I opened them, and saw that this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"luminous agent came from a half globe, unpolished, placed in the roof","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the cabin.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“At last one can see,” cried Ned Land, who, knife in hand, stood on the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"defensive.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes,” said I; “but we are still in the dark about ourselves.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Let master have patience,” said the imperturbable Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The sudden lighting of the cabin enabled me to examine it minutely. It","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"only contained a table and five stools. The invisible door might be","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hermetically sealed. No noise was heard. All seemed dead in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"interior of this boat. Did it move, did it float on the surface of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ocean, or did it dive into its depths? I could not guess.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"A noise of bolts was now heard, the door opened, and two men appeared.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"One was short, very muscular, broad-shouldered, with robust limbs,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"strong head, an abundance of black hair, thick moustache, a quick","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"penetrating look, and the vivacity which characterises the population","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of Southern France.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The second stranger merits a more detailed description. A disciple of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Gratiolet or Engel would have read his face like an open book. I made","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"out his prevailing qualities directly:—self-confidence,—because his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"head was well set on his shoulders, and his black eyes looked around","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with cold assurance; calmness,—for his skin, rather pale, showed his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"coolness of blood; energy,—evinced by the rapid contraction of his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"lofty brows; and courage,—because his deep breathing denoted great","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"power of lungs.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Whether this person was thirty-five or fifty years of age, I could not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"say. He was tall, had a large forehead, straight nose, a clearly cut","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"mouth, beautiful teeth, with fine taper hands, indicative of a highly","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"nervous temperament. This man was certainly the most admirable specimen","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I had ever met. One particular feature was his eyes, rather far from","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"each other, and which could take in nearly a quarter of the horizon at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"once.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"This faculty—(I verified it later)—gave him a range of vision far","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"superior to Ned Land’s. When this stranger fixed upon an object, his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"eyebrows met, his large eyelids closed around so as to contract the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"range of his vision, and he looked as if he magnified the objects","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"lessened by distance, as if he pierced those sheets of water so opaque","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to our eyes, and as if he read the very depths of the seas.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The two strangers, with caps made from the fur of the sea otter, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shod with sea boots of seal’s skin, were dressed in clothes of a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"particular texture, which allowed free movement of the limbs. The","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"taller of the two, evidently the chief on board, examined us with great","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"attention, without saying a word; then turning to his companion, talked","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with him in an unknown tongue. It was a sonorous, harmonious, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"flexible dialect, the vowels seeming to admit of very varied","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"accentuation.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The other replied by a shake of the head, and added two or three","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"perfectly incomprehensible words. Then he seemed to question me by a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"look.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I replied in good French that I did not know his language; but he","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"seemed not to understand me, and my situation became more embarrassing.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“If master were to tell our story,” said Conseil, “perhaps these","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"gentlemen may understand some words.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I began to tell our adventures, articulating each syllable clearly, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"without omitting one single detail. I announced our names and rank,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"introducing in person Professor Aronnax, his servant Conseil, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"master Ned Land, the harpooner.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The man with the soft calm eyes listened to me quietly, even politely,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and with extreme attention; but nothing in his countenance indicated","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that he had understood my story. When I finished, he said not a word.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"There remained one resource, to speak English. Perhaps they would know","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"this almost universal language. I knew it, as well as the German","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"language,—well enough to read it fluently, but not to speak it","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"correctly. But, anyhow, we must make ourselves understood.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Go on in your turn,” I said to the harpooner; “speak your best","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Anglo-Saxon, and try to do better than I.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Ned did not beg off, and recommenced our story.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"To his great disgust, the harpooner did not seem to have made himself","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"more intelligible than I had. Our visitors did not stir. They evidently","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"understood neither the language of Arago nor of Faraday.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Very much embarrassed, after having vainly exhausted our speaking","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"resources, I knew not what part to take, when Conseil said—","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“If master will permit me, I will relate it in German.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"But in spite of the elegant terms and good accent of the narrator, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"German language had no success. At last, nonplussed, I tried to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"remember my first lessons, and to narrate our adventures in Latin, but","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with no better success. This last attempt being of no avail, the two","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"strangers exchanged some words in their unknown language, and retired.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The door shut.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“It is an infamous shame,” cried Ned Land, who broke out for the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"twentieth time. “We speak to those rogues in French, English, German,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and Latin, and not one of them has the politeness to answer!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Calm yourself,” I said to the impetuous Ned, “anger will do no good.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But do you see, Professor,” replied our irascible companion, “that we","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shall absolutely die of hunger in this iron cage?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Bah!” said Conseil, philosophically; “we can hold out some time yet.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“My friends,” I said, “we must not despair. We have been worse off than","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"this. Do me the favour to wait a little before forming an opinion upon","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the commander and crew of this boat.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“My opinion is formed,” replied Ned Land, sharply. “They are rascals.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Good! and from what country?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“From the land of rogues!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“My brave Ned, that country is not clearly indicated on the map of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"world; but I admit that the nationality of the two strangers is hard to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"determine. Neither English, French, nor German, that is quite certain.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"However, I am inclined to think that the commander and his companion","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"were born in low latitudes. There is southern blood in them. But I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cannot decide by their appearance whether they are Spaniards, Turks,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Arabians, or Indians. As to their language, it is quite","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"incomprehensible.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“There is the disadvantage of not knowing all languages,” said Conseil,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“or the disadvantage of not having one universal language.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"As he said these words, the door opened. A steward entered. He brought","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"us clothes, coats and trousers, made of a stuff I did not know. I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hastened to dress myself, and my companions followed my example. During","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that time, the steward—dumb, perhaps deaf—had arranged the table, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"laid three plates.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“This is something like,” said Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Bah!” said the rancorous harpooner, “what do you suppose they eat","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"here? Tortoise liver, filleted shark, and beefsteaks from sea-dogs.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“We shall see,” said Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The dishes, of bell metal, were placed on the table, and we took our","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"places. Undoubtedly we had to do with civilised people, and, had it not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"been for the electric light which flooded us, I could have fancied I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was in the dining-room of the Adelphi Hotel at Liverpool, or at the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Grand Hotel in Paris. I must say, however, that there was neither bread","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"nor wine. The water was fresh and clear, but it was water, and did not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"suit Ned Land’s taste. Amongst the dishes which were brought to us, I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"recognised several fish delicately dressed; but of some, although","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"excellent, I could give no opinion, neither could I tell to what","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"kingdom they belonged, whether animal or vegetable. As to the dinner","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"service, it was elegant, and in perfect taste. Each utensil, spoon,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fork, knife, plate, had a letter engraved on it, with a motto above it,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of which this is an exact facsimile:—","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"MOBILIS IN MOBILI","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"N.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The letter N was no doubt the initial of the name of the enigmatical","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"person, who commanded at the bottom of the sea.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Ned and Conseil did not reflect much. They devoured the food, and I did","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"likewise. I was, besides, reassured as to our fate; and it seemed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"evident that our hosts would not let us die of want.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"However, everything has an end, everything passes away, even the hunger","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of people who have not eaten for fifteen hours. Our appetites","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"satisfied, we felt overcome with sleep.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Faith! I shall sleep well,” said Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“So shall I,” replied Ned Land.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"My two companions stretched themselves on the cabin carpet, and were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"soon sound asleep. For my own part, too many thoughts crowded my brain,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"too many insoluble questions pressed upon me, too many fancies kept my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"eyes half open. Where were we? What strange power carried us on? I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"felt—or rather fancied I felt—the machine sinking down to the lowest","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"mysterious asylums a world of unknown animals, amongst which this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"submarine boat seemed to be of the same kind, living, moving, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"formidable as they. Then my brain grew calmer, my imagination wandered","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"into vague unconsciousness, and I soon fell into a deep sleep.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"NED LAND’S TEMPERS","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"How long we slept I do not know; but our sleep must have lasted long,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"for it rested us completely from our fatigues. I woke first. My","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"companions had not moved, and were still stretched in their corner.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Hardly roused from my somewhat hard couch, I felt my brain freed, my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"mind clear. I then began an attentive examination of our cell. Nothing","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was changed inside. The prison was still a prison,—the prisoners,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"prisoners. However, the steward, during our sleep, had cleared the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"table. I breathed with difficulty. The heavy air seemed to oppress my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"lungs. Although the cell was large, we had evidently consumed a great","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"part of the oxygen that it contained. Indeed, each man consumes, in one","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hour, the oxygen contained in more than 176 pints of air, and this air,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"charged (as then) with a nearly equal quantity of carbonic acid,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"becomes unbreathable.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"It became necessary to renew the atmosphere of our prison, and no doubt","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the whole in the submarine boat. That gave rise to a question in my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"mind. How would the commander of this floating dwelling-place proceed?","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Would he obtain air by chemical means, in getting by heat the oxygen","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"contained in chlorate of potash, and in absorbing carbonic acid by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"caustic potash? Or, a more convenient, economical, and consequently","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"more probable alternative, would he be satisfied to rise and take","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"breath at the surface of the water, like a cetacean, and so renew for","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"twenty-four hours the atmospheric provision?","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"In fact, I was already obliged to increase my respirations to eke out","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of this cell the little oxygen it contained, when suddenly I was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"refreshed by a current of pure air, and perfumed with saline","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"emanations. It was an invigorating sea breeze, charged with iodine. I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"opened my mouth wide, and my lungs saturated themselves with fresh","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"particles.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At the same time I felt the boat rolling. The iron-plated monster had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"evidently just risen to the surface of the ocean to breathe, after the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fashion of whales. I found out from that the mode of ventilating the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"boat.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"When I had inhaled this air freely, I sought the conduit-pipe, which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"conveyed to us the beneficial whiff, and I was not long in finding it.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Above the door was a ventilator, through which volumes of fresh air","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"renewed the impoverished atmosphere of the cell.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I was making my observations, when Ned and Conseil awoke almost at the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"same time, under the influence of this reviving air. They rubbed their","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"eyes, stretched themselves, and were on their feet in an instant.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Did master sleep well?” asked Conseil, with his usual politeness.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Very well, my brave boy. And you, Mr. Land?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Soundly, Professor. But I don’t know if I am right or not; there seems","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to be a sea breeze!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"A seaman could not be mistaken, and I told the Canadian all that had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"passed during his sleep.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Good!” said he; “that accounts for those roarings we heard, when the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"supposed narwhal sighted the _Abraham Lincoln_.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Quite so, Master Land; it was taking breath.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Only, Mr. Aronnax, I have no idea what o’clock it is, unless it is","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"dinner-time.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Dinner-time! my good fellow? Say rather breakfast-time, for we","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"certainly have begun another day.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“So,” said Conseil, “we have slept twenty-four hours?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“That is my opinion.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I will not contradict you,” replied Ned Land. “But dinner or","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"breakfast, the steward will be welcome, whichever he brings.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Master Land, we must conform to the rules on board, and I suppose our","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"appetites are in advance of the dinner hour.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“That is just like you, friend Conseil,” said Ned, impatiently. “You","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"are never out of temper, always calm; you would return thanks before","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"grace, and die of hunger rather than complain!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Time was getting on, and we were fearfully hungry; and this time the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"steward did not appear. It was rather too long to leave us, if they","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"really had good intentions towards us. Ned Land, tormented by the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cravings of hunger, got still more angry; and, notwithstanding his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"promise, I dreaded an explosion when he found himself with one of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"crew.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"For two hours more Ned Land’s temper increased; he cried, he shouted,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"but in vain. The walls were deaf. There was no sound to be heard in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"boat: all was still as death. It did not move, for I should have felt","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the trembling motion of the hull under the influence of the screw.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Plunged in the depths of the waters, it belonged no longer to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"earth:—this silence was dreadful.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I felt terrified, Conseil was calm, Ned Land roared.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Just then a noise was heard outside. Steps sounded on the metal flags.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The locks were turned, the door opened, and the steward appeared.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Before I could rush forward to stop him, the Canadian had thrown him","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"down, and held him by the throat. The steward was choking under the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"grip of his powerful hand.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Conseil was already trying to unclasp the harpooner’s hand from his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"half-suffocated victim, and I was going to fly to the rescue, when","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"suddenly I was nailed to the spot by hearing these words in French—","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Be quiet, Master Land; and you, Professor, will you be so good as to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"listen to me?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"CHAPTER X","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"THE MAN OF THE SEAS","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"It was the commander of the vessel who thus spoke.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At these words, Ned Land rose suddenly. The steward, nearly strangled,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"tottered out on a sign from his master; but such was the power of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"commander on board, that not a gesture betrayed the resentment which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"this man must have felt towards the Canadian. Conseil, interested in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"spite of himself, I stupefied, awaited in silence the result of this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"scene.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The commander, leaning against the corner of a table with his arms","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"folded, scanned us with profound attention. Did he hesitate to speak?","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Did he regret the words which he had just spoken in French? One might","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"almost think so.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"After some moments of silence, which not one of us dreamed of breaking,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Gentlemen,” said he, in a calm and penetrating voice, “I speak French,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"English, German, and Latin equally well. I could, therefore, have","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"answered you at our first interview, but I wished to know you first,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"then to reflect. The story told by each one, entirely agreeing in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"main points, convinced me of your identity. I know now that chance has","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"brought before me M. Pierre Aronnax, Professor of Natural History at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the Museum of Paris, entrusted with a scientific mission abroad,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Conseil, his servant, and Ned Land, of Canadian origin, harpooner on","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"board the frigate _Abraham Lincoln_ of the navy of the United States of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"America.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I bowed assent. It was not a question that the commander put to me.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Therefore there was no answer to be made. This man expressed himself","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with perfect ease, without any accent. His sentences were well turned,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"his words clear, and his fluency of speech remarkable. Yet, I did not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"recognise in him a fellow-countryman.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"He continued the conversation in these terms:","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“You have doubtless thought, sir, that I have delayed long in paying","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"you this second visit. The reason is that, your identity recognised, I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"wished to weigh maturely what part to act towards you. I have hesitated","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"much. Most annoying circumstances have brought you into the presence of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a man who has broken all the ties of humanity. You have come to trouble","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"my existence.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Unintentionally!” said I.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Unintentionally?” replied the stranger, raising his voice a little;","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“was it unintentionally that the _Abraham Lincoln_ pursued me all over","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the seas? Was it unintentionally that you took passage in this frigate?","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Was it unintentionally that your cannon balls rebounded off the plating","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of my vessel? Was it unintentionally that Mr. Ned Land struck me with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"his harpoon?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I detected a restrained irritation in these words. But to these","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"recriminations I had a very natural answer to make and I made it.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Sir,” said I, “no doubt you are ignorant of the discussions which have","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"taken place concerning you in America and Europe. You do not know that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"divers accidents, caused by collisions with your submarine machine,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"have excited public feeling in the two continents. I omit the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hypotheses without number by which it was sought to explain the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"inexplicable phenomenon of which you alone possess the secret. But you","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"must understand that, in pursuing you over the high seas of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Pacific, the _Abraham Lincoln_ believed itself to be chasing some","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"powerful sea-monster, of which it was necessary to rid the ocean at any","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"price.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"A half-smile curled the lips of the commander: then, in a calmer tone—","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“M. Aronnax,” he replied, “dare you affirm that your frigate would not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"as soon have pursued and cannonaded a submarine boat as a monster?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"This question embarrassed me, for certainly Captain Farragut might not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"have hesitated. He might have thought it his duty to destroy a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"contrivance of this kind, as he would a gigantic narwhal.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“You understand then, sir,” continued the stranger, “that I have the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"right to treat you as enemies?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I answered nothing, purposely. For what good would it be to discuss","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"such a proposition, when force could destroy the best arguments?","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I have hesitated some time,” continued the commander; “nothing obliged","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"me to show you hospitality. If I chose to separate myself from you, I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"should have no interest in seeing you again; I could place you upon the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"deck of this vessel which has served you as a refuge, I could sink","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"beneath the waters, and forget that you had ever existed. Would not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that be my right?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“It might be the right of a savage,” I answered, “but not that of a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"civilised man.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Professor,” replied the commander, quickly, “I am not what you call a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"civilised man! I have done with society entirely, for reasons which I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"alone have the right of appreciating. I do not therefore obey its laws,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and I desire you never to allude to them before me again!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"This was said plainly. A flash of anger and disdain kindled in the eyes","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the Unknown, and I had a glimpse of a terrible past in the life of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"this man. Not only had he put himself beyond the pale of human laws,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"but he had made himself independent of them, free in the strictest","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"acceptation of the word, quite beyond their reach! Who then would dare","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to pursue him at the bottom of the sea, when, on its surface, he defied","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"all attempts made against him? What vessel could resist the shock of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"his submarine monitor? What cuirass, however thick, could withstand the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"blows of his spur? No man could demand from him an account of his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"actions; God, if he believed in one—his conscience, if he had one—were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the sole judges to whom he was answerable.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"These reflections crossed my mind rapidly, whilst the stranger","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"personage was silent, absorbed, and as if wrapped up in himself. I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"regarded him with fear mingled with interest, as doubtless, Œdipus","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"regarded the Sphinx.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"After rather a long silence, the commander resumed the conversation.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I have hesitated,” said he, “but I have thought that my interest might","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"be reconciled with that pity to which every human being has a right.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"You will remain on board my vessel, since fate has cast you there. You","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"will be free; and, in exchange for this liberty, I shall only impose","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"one single condition. Your word of honour to submit to it will","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"suffice.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Speak, sir,” I answered. “I suppose this condition is one which a man","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of honour may accept?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, sir; it is this. It is possible that certain events, unforeseen,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"may oblige me to consign you to your cabins for some hours or some","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"days, as the case may be. As I desire never to use violence, I expect","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"from you, more than all the others, a passive obedience. In thus","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"acting, I take all the responsibility: I acquit you entirely, for I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"make it an impossibility for you to see what ought not to be seen. Do","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"you accept this condition?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Then things took place on board which, to say the least, were singular,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and which ought not to be seen by people who were not placed beyond the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pale of social laws. Amongst the surprises which the future was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"preparing for me, this might not be the least.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“We accept,” I answered; “only I will ask your permission, sir, to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"address one question to you—one only.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Speak, sir.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“You said that we should be free on board.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Entirely.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I ask you, then, what you mean by this liberty?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Just the liberty to go, to come, to see, to observe even all that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"passes here,—save under rare circumstances,—the liberty, in short,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which we enjoy ourselves, my companions and I.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"It was evident that we did not understand one another.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Pardon me, sir,” I resumed, “but this liberty is only what every","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"prisoner has of pacing his prison. It cannot suffice us.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“It must suffice you, however.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“What! we must renounce for ever seeing our country, our friends, our","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"relations again?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, sir. But to renounce that unendurable worldly yoke which men","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"believe to be liberty, is not perhaps so painful as you think.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well,” exclaimed Ned Land, “never will I give my word of honour not to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"try to escape.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I did not ask you for your word of honour, Master Land,” answered the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"commander, coldly.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Sir,” I replied, beginning to get angry in spite of myself, “you abuse","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"your situation towards us; it is cruelty.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“No, sir, it is clemency. You are my prisoners of war. I keep you, when","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I could, by a word, plunge you into the depths of the ocean. You","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"attacked me. You came to surprise a secret which no man in the world","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"must penetrate,—the secret of my whole existence. And you think that I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"am going to send you back to that world which must know me no more?","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Never! In retaining you, it is not you whom I guard—it is myself.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"These words indicated a resolution taken on the part of the commander,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"against which no arguments would prevail.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“So, sir,” I rejoined, “you give us simply the choice between life and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"death?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Simply.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“My friends,” said I, “to a question thus put, there is nothing to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"answer. But no word of honour binds us to the master of this vessel.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“None, sir,” answered the Unknown.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Then, in a gentler tone, he continued—","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Now, permit me to finish what I have to say to you. I know you, M.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Aronnax. You and your companions will not, perhaps, have so much to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"complain of in the chance which has bound you to my fate. You will find","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"amongst the books which are my favourite study the work which you have","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"published on ‘the depths of the sea.’ I have often read it. You have","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"carried out your work as far as terrestrial science permitted you. But","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"you do not know all—you have not seen all. Let me tell you then,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Professor, that you will not regret the time passed on board my vessel.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"You are going to visit the land of marvels.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"These words of the commander had a great effect upon me. I cannot deny","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"it. My weak point was touched; and I forgot, for a moment, that the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"contemplation of these sublime subjects was not worth the loss of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"liberty. Besides, I trusted to the future to decide this grave","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"question. So I contented myself with saying—","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“By what name ought I to address you?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Sir,” replied the commander, “I am nothing to you but Captain Nemo;","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and you and your companions are nothing to me but the passengers of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo called. A steward appeared. The captain gave him his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"orders in that strange language which I did not understand. Then,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"turning towards the Canadian and Conseil—","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“A repast awaits you in your cabin,” said he. “Be so good as to follow","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"this man.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“And now, M. Aronnax, our breakfast is ready. Permit me to lead the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"way.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I am at your service, Captain.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I followed Captain Nemo; and as soon as I had passed through the door,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I found myself in a kind of passage lighted by electricity, similar to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the waist of a ship. After we had proceeded a dozen yards, a second","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"door opened before me.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I then entered a dining-room, decorated and furnished in severe taste.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"High oaken sideboards, inlaid with ebony, stood at the two extremities","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the room, and upon their shelves glittered china, porcelain, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"glass of inestimable value. The plate on the table sparkled in the rays","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which the luminous ceiling shed around, while the light was tempered","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and softened by exquisite paintings.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"In the centre of the room was a table richly laid out. Captain Nemo","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"indicated the place I was to occupy.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The breakfast consisted of a certain number of dishes, the contents of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which were furnished by the sea alone; and I was ignorant of the nature","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and mode of preparation of some of them. I acknowledged that they were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"good, but they had a peculiar flavour, which I easily became accustomed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to. These different aliments appeared to me to be rich in phosphorus,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and I thought they must have a marine origin.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo looked at me. I asked him no questions, but he guessed my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"thoughts, and answered of his own accord the questions which I was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"burning to address to him.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“The greater part of these dishes are unknown to you,” he said to me.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“However, you may partake of them without fear. They are wholesome and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"nourishing. For a long time I have renounced the food of the earth, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"am never ill now. My crew, who are healthy, are fed on the same food.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“So,” said I, “all these eatables are the produce of the sea?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, Professor, the sea supplies all my wants. Sometimes I cast my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"nets in tow, and I draw them in ready to break. Sometimes I hunt in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"midst of this element, which appears to be inaccessible to man, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"quarry the game which dwells in my submarine forests. My flocks, like","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"those of Neptune’s old shepherds, graze fearlessly in the immense","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"prairies of the ocean. I have a vast property there, which I cultivate","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"myself, and which is always sown by the hand of the Creator of all","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"things.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I can understand perfectly, sir, that your nets furnish excellent fish","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"for your table; I can understand also that you hunt aquatic game in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"your submarine forests; but I cannot understand at all how a particle","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of meat, no matter how small, can figure in your bill of fare.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“This, which you believe to be meat, Professor, is nothing else than","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fillet of turtle. Here are also some dolphins’ livers, which you take","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to be ragout of pork. My cook is a clever fellow, who excels in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"dressing these various products of the ocean. Taste all these dishes.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Here is a preserve of holothuria, which a Malay would declare to be","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"unrivalled in the world; here is a cream, of which the milk has been","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"furnished by the cetacea, and the sugar by the great fucus of the North","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Sea; and lastly, permit me to offer you some preserve of anemones,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which is equal to that of the most delicious fruits.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I tasted, more from curiosity than as a connoisseur, whilst Captain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Nemo enchanted me with his extraordinary stories.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“You like the sea, Captain?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes; I love it! The sea is everything. It covers seven-tenths of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"terrestrial globe. Its breath is pure and healthy. It is an immense","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"desert, where man is never lonely, for he feels life stirring on all","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sides. The sea is only the embodiment of a supernatural and wonderful","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"existence. It is nothing but love and emotion; it is the ‘Living","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Infinite,’ as one of your poets has said. In fact, Professor, Nature","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"manifests herself in it by her three kingdoms, mineral, vegetable, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"animal. The sea is the vast reservoir of Nature. The globe began with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sea, so to speak; and who knows if it will not end with it? In it is","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"supreme tranquillity. The sea does not belong to despots. Upon its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"surface men can still exercise unjust laws, fight, tear one another to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pieces, and be carried away with terrestrial horrors. But at thirty","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"feet below its level, their reign ceases, their influence is quenched,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and their power disappears. Ah! sir, live—live in the bosom of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"waters! There only is independence! There I recognise no masters! There","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I am free!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo suddenly became silent in the midst of this enthusiasm, by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which he was quite carried away. For a few moments he paced up and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"down, much agitated. Then he became more calm, regained his accustomed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"coldness of expression, and turning towards me—","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Now, Professor,” said he, “if you wish to go over the _Nautilus_, I am","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"at your service.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo rose. I followed him. A double door, contrived at the back","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the dining-room, opened, and I entered a room equal in dimensions to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that which I had just quitted.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"It was a library. High pieces of furniture, of black violet ebony","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"inlaid with brass, supported upon their wide shelves a great number of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"books uniformly bound. They followed the shape of the room, terminating","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"at the lower part in huge divans, covered with brown leather, which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"were curved, to afford the greatest comfort. Light movable desks, made","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to slide in and out at will, allowed one to rest one’s book while","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"reading. In the centre stood an immense table, covered with pamphlets,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"amongst which were some newspapers, already of old date. The electric","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"light flooded everything; it was shed from four unpolished globes half","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sunk in the volutes of the ceiling. I looked with real admiration at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"this room, so ingeniously fitted up, and I could scarcely believe my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"eyes.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Captain Nemo,” said I to my host, who had just thrown himself on one","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the divans, “this is a library which would do honour to more than","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"one of the continental palaces, and I am absolutely astounded when I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"consider that it can follow you to the bottom of the seas.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Where could one find greater solitude or silence, Professor?” replied","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo. “Did your study in the Museum afford you such perfect","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"quiet?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“No, sir; and I must confess that it is a very poor one after yours.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"You must have six or seven thousand volumes here.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Twelve thousand, M. Aronnax. These are the only ties which bind me to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the earth. But I had done with the world on the day when my _Nautilus_","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"plunged for the first time beneath the waters. That day I bought my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"last volumes, my last pamphlets, my last papers, and from that time I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"wish to think that men no longer think or write. These books,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Professor, are at your service besides, and you can make use of them","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"freely.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I thanked Captain Nemo, and went up to the shelves of the library.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Works on science, morals, and literature abounded in every language;","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"but I did not see one single work on political economy; that subject","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"appeared to be strictly proscribed. Strange to say, all these books","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"were irregularly arranged, in whatever language they were written; and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"this medley proved that the Captain of the _Nautilus_ must have read","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"indiscriminately the books which he took up by chance.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Sir,” said I to the Captain, “I thank you for having placed this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"library at my disposal. It contains treasures of science, and I shall","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"profit by them.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“This room is not only a library,” said Captain Nemo, “it is also a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"smoking-room.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“A smoking-room!” I cried. “Then one may smoke on board?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Certainly.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Then, sir, I am forced to believe that you have kept up a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"communication with Havannah.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Not any,” answered the Captain. “Accept this cigar, M. Aronnax; and,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"though it does not come from Havannah, you will be pleased with it, if","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"you are a connoisseur.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I took the cigar which was offered me; its shape recalled the London","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ones, but it seemed to be made of leaves of gold. I lighted it at a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"little brazier, which was supported upon an elegant bronze stem, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"drew the first whiffs with the delight of a lover of smoking who has","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"not smoked for two days.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“It is excellent, but it is not tobacco.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“No!” answered the Captain, “this tobacco comes neither from Havannah","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"nor from the East. It is a kind of sea-weed, rich in nicotine, with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which the sea provides me, but somewhat sparingly.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At that moment Captain Nemo opened a door which stood opposite to that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"by which I had entered the library, and I passed into an immense","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"drawing-room splendidly lighted.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"It was a vast four-sided room, thirty feet long, eighteen wide, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fifteen high. A luminous ceiling, decorated with light arabesques, shed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a soft clear light over all the marvels accumulated in this museum. For","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"it was in fact a museum, in which an intelligent and prodigal hand had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"gathered all the treasures of nature and art, with the artistic","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"confusion which distinguishes a painter’s studio.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Thirty first-rate pictures, uniformly framed, separated by bright","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"drapery, ornamented the walls, which were hung with tapestry of severe","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"design. I saw works of great value, the greater part of which I had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"admired in the special collections of Europe, and in the exhibitions of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"paintings. The several schools of the old masters were represented by a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Madonna of Raphael, a Virgin of Leonardo da Vinci, a nymph of Corregio,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a woman of Titan, an Adoration of Veronese, an Assumption of Murillo, a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"portrait of Holbein, a monk of Velasquez, a martyr of Ribera, a fair of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Rubens, two Flemish landscapes of Teniers, three little “genre”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pictures of Gerard Dow, Metsu, and Paul Potter, two specimens of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Géricault and Prudhon, and some sea-pieces of Backhuysen and Vernet.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Amongst the works of modern painters were pictures with the signatures","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of Delacroix, Ingres, Decamps, Troyon, Meissonier, Daubigny, etc.; and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"some admirable statues in marble and bronze, after the finest antique","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"models, stood upon pedestals in the corners of this magnificent museum.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Amazement, as the Captain of the _Nautilus_ had predicted, had already","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"begun to take possession of me.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Professor,” said this strange man, “you must excuse the unceremonious","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"way in which I receive you, and the disorder of this room.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Sir,” I answered, “without seeking to know who you are, I recognise in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"you an artist.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“An amateur, nothing more, sir. Formerly I loved to collect these","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"beautiful works created by the hand of man. I sought them greedily, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ferreted them out indefatigably, and I have been able to bring together","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"some objects of great value. These are my last souvenirs of that world","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which is dead to me. In my eyes, your modern artists are already old;","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"they have two or three thousand years of existence; I confound them in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"my own mind. Masters have no age.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“And these musicians?” said I, pointing out some works of Weber,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Rossini, Mozart, Beethoven, Haydn, Meyerbeer, Hérold, Wagner, Auber,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Gounod, and a number of others, scattered over a large model","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"piano-organ which occupied one of the panels of the drawing-room.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“These musicians,” replied Captain Nemo, “are the contemporaries of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Orpheus; for in the memory of the dead all chronological differences","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"are effaced; and I am dead, Professor; as much dead as those of your","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"friends who are sleeping six feet under the earth!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo was silent, and seemed lost in a profound reverie. I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"contemplated him with deep interest, analysing in silence the strange","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"expression of his countenance. Leaning on his elbow against an angle of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a costly mosaic table, he no longer saw me,—he had forgotten my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"presence.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I did not disturb this reverie, and continued my observation of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"curiosities which enriched this drawing-room.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Under elegant glass cases, fixed by copper rivets, were classed and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"labelled the most precious productions of the sea which had ever been","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"presented to the eye of a naturalist. My delight as a professor may be","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"conceived.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The division containing the zoophytes presented the most curious","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"specimens of the two groups of polypi and echinodermes. In the first","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"group, the tubipores, were gorgones arranged like a fan, soft sponges","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of Syria, ises of the Moluccas, pennatules, an admirable virgularia of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the Norwegian seas, variegated unbellulairæ, alcyonariæ, a whole series","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of madrepores, which my master Milne Edwards has so cleverly","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"classified, amongst which I remarked some wonderful flabellinæ oculinæ","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the Island of Bourbon, the “Neptune’s car” of the Antilles, superb","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"varieties of corals—in short, every species of those curious polypi of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which entire islands are formed, which will one day become continents.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Of the echinodermes, remarkable for their coating of spines, asteri,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sea-stars, pantacrinæ, comatules, astérophons, echini, holothuri, etc.,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"represented individually a complete collection of this group.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"A somewhat nervous conchyliologist would certainly have fainted before","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"other more numerous cases, in which were classified the specimens of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"molluscs. It was a collection of inestimable value, which time fails me","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to describe minutely. Amongst these specimens I will quote from memory","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"only the elegant royal hammer-fish of the Indian Ocean, whose regular","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"white spots stood out brightly on a red and brown ground, an imperial","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"spondyle, bright-coloured, bristling with spines, a rare specimen in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the European museums—(I estimated its value at not less than £1000); a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"common hammer-fish of the seas of New Holland, which is only procured","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with difficulty; exotic buccardia of Senegal; fragile white bivalve","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shells, which a breath might shatter like a soap-bubble; several","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"varieties of the aspirgillum of Java, a kind of calcareous tube, edged","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with leafy folds, and much debated by amateurs; a whole series of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"trochi, some a greenish-yellow, found in the American seas, others a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"reddish-brown, natives of Australian waters; others from the Gulf of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Mexico, remarkable for their imbricated shell; stellari found in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Southern Seas; and last, the rarest of all, the magnificent spur of New","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Zealand; and every description of delicate and fragile shells to which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"science has given appropriate names.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Apart, in separate compartments, were spread out chaplets of pearls of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the greatest beauty, which reflected the electric light in little","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sparks of fire; pink pearls, torn from the pinna-marina of the Red Sea;","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"green pearls of the haliotyde iris; yellow, blue and black pearls, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"curious productions of the divers molluscs of every ocean, and certain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"mussels of the water-courses of the North; lastly, several specimens of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"inestimable value which had been gathered from the rarest pintadines.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Some of these pearls were larger than a pigeon’s egg, and were worth as","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"much, and more than that which the traveller Tavernier sold to the Shah","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of Persia for three millions, and surpassed the one in the possession","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the Imaum of Muscat, which I had believed to be unrivalled in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"world.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Therefore, to estimate the value of this collection was simply","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"impossible. Captain Nemo must have expended millions in the acquirement","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of these various specimens, and I was thinking what source he could","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"have drawn from, to have been able thus to gratify his fancy for","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"collecting, when I was interrupted by these words—","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“You are examining my shells, Professor? Unquestionably they must be","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"interesting to a naturalist; but for me they have a far greater charm,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"for I have collected them all with my own hand, and there is not a sea","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"on the face of the globe which has escaped my researches.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I can understand, Captain, the delight of wandering about in the midst","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of such riches. You are one of those who have collected their treasures","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"themselves. No museum in Europe possesses such a collection of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"produce of the ocean. But if I exhaust all my admiration upon it, I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shall have none left for the vessel which carries it. I do not wish to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pry into your secrets; but I must confess that this _Nautilus_, with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the motive power which is confined in it, the contrivances which enable","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"it to be worked, the powerful agent which propels it, all excite my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"curiosity to the highest pitch. I see suspended on the walls of this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"room instruments of whose use I am ignorant.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“You will find these same instruments in my own room, Professor, where","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I shall have much pleasure in explaining their use to you. But first","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"come and inspect the cabin which is set apart for your own use. You","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"must see how you will be accommodated on board the _Nautilus_.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I followed Captain Nemo, who, by one of the doors opening from each","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"panel of the drawing-room, regained the waist. He conducted me towards","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the bow, and there I found, not a cabin, but an elegant room, with a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"bed, dressing-table, and several other pieces of furniture.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I could only thank my host.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Your room adjoins mine,” said he, opening a door, “and mine opens into","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the drawing-room that we have just quitted.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I entered the Captain’s room: it had a severe, almost a monkish,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"aspect. A small iron bedstead, a table, some articles for the toilet;","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the whole lighted by a skylight. No comforts, the strictest necessaries","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"only.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo pointed to a seat.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Be so good as to sit down,” he said. I seated myself, and he began","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"thus:","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"CHAPTER XI","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ALL BY ELECTRICITY","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Sir,” said Captain Nemo, showing me the instruments hanging on the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"walls of his room, “here are the contrivances required for the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"navigation of the _Nautilus_. Here, as in the drawing-room, I have them","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"always under my eyes, and they indicate my position and exact direction","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in the middle of the ocean. Some are known to you, such as the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"thermometer, which gives the internal temperature of the _Nautilus;_","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the barometer, which indicates the weight of the air and foretells the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"changes of the weather; the hygrometer, which marks the dryness of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"atmosphere; the storm-glass, the contents of which, by decomposing,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"announce the approach of tempests; the compass, which guides my course;","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the sextant, which shows the latitude by the altitude of the sun;","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"chronometers, by which I calculate the longitude; and glasses for day","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and night, which I use to examine the points of the horizon, when the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_ rises to the surface of the waves.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“These are the usual nautical instruments,” I replied, “and I know the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"use of them. But these others, no doubt, answer to the particular","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"requirements of the _Nautilus_. This dial with the movable needle is a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"manometer, is it not?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“It is actually a manometer. But by communication with the water, whose","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"external pressure it indicates, it gives our depth at the same time.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“And these other instruments, the use of which I cannot guess?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Here, Professor, I ought to give you some explanations. Will you be","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"kind enough to listen to me?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"He was silent for a few moments, then he said—","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“There is a powerful agent, obedient, rapid, easy, which conforms to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"every use, and reigns supreme on board my vessel. Everything is done by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"means of it. It lights it, warms it, and is the soul of my mechanical","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"apparatus. This agent is electricity.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Electricity?” I cried in surprise.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, sir.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Nevertheless, Captain, you possess an extreme rapidity of movement,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which does not agree with the power of electricity. Until now, its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"dynamic force has remained under restraint, and has only been able to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"produce a small amount of power.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Professor,” said Captain Nemo, “my electricity is not everybody’s. You","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"know what sea-water is composed of. In a thousand grammes are found 96½","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"per cent. of water, and about 2-2/3 per cent. of chloride of sodium;","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"then, in a smaller quantity, chlorides of magnesium and of potassium,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"bromide of magnesium, sulphate of magnesia, sulphate and carbonate of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"lime. You see, then, that chloride of sodium forms a large part of it.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"So it is this sodium that I extract from sea-water, and of which I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"compose my ingredients. I owe all to the ocean; it produces","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"electricity, and electricity gives heat, light, motion, and, in a word,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"life to the _Nautilus_.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But not the air you breathe?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Oh! I could manufacture the air necessary for my consumption, but it","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"is useless, because I go up to the surface of the water when I please.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"However, if electricity does not furnish me with air to breathe, it","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"works at least the powerful pumps that are stored in spacious","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"reservoirs, and which enable me to prolong at need, and as long as I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"will, my stay in the depths of the sea. It gives a uniform and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"unintermittent light, which the sun does not. Now look at this clock;","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"it is electrical, and goes with a regularity that defies the best","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"chronometers. I have divided it into twenty-four hours, like the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Italian clocks, because for me there is neither night nor day, sun nor","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"moon, but only that factitious light that I take with me to the bottom","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the sea. Look! just now, it is ten o’clock in the morning.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Exactly.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Another application of electricity. This dial hanging in front of us","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"indicates the speed of the _Nautilus_. An electric thread puts it in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"communication with the screw, and the needle indicates the real speed.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Look! now we are spinning along with a uniform speed of fifteen miles","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"an hour.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“It is marvelous! And I see, Captain, you were right to make use of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"this agent that takes the place of wind, water, and steam.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“We have not finished, M. Aronnax,” said Captain Nemo, rising. “If you","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"will follow me, we will examine the stern of the _Nautilus_.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Really, I knew already the anterior part of this submarine boat, of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which this is the exact division, starting from the ship’s head:—the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"dining-room, five yards long, separated from the library by a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"water-tight partition; the library, five yards long; the large","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"drawing-room, ten yards long, separated from the Captain’s room by a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"second water-tight partition; the said room, five yards in length;","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"mine, two and a half yards; and, lastly a reservoir of air, seven and a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"half yards, that extended to the bows. Total length thirty five yards,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"or one hundred and five feet. The partitions had doors that were shut","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hermetically by means of india-rubber instruments, and they ensured the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"safety of the _Nautilus_ in case of a leak.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I followed Captain Nemo through the waist, and arrived at the centre of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the boat. There was a sort of well that opened between two partitions.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"An iron ladder, fastened with an iron hook to the partition, led to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"upper end. I asked the Captain what the ladder was used for.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“It leads to the small boat,” he said.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“What! have you a boat?” I exclaimed, in surprise.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Of course; an excellent vessel, light and insubmersible, that serves","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"either as a fishing or as a pleasure boat.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But then, when you wish to embark, you are obliged to come to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"surface of the water?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Not at all. This boat is attached to the upper part of the hull of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_, and occupies a cavity made for it. It is decked, quite","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"water-tight, and held together by solid bolts. This ladder leads to a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"man-hole made in the hull of the _Nautilus_, that corresponds with a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"similar hole made in the side of the boat. By this double opening I get","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"into the small vessel. They shut the one belonging to the _Nautilus;_ I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shut the other by means of screw pressure. I undo the bolts, and the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"little boat goes up to the surface of the sea with prodigious rapidity.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I then open the panel of the bridge, carefully shut till then; I mast","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"it, hoist my sail, take my oars, and I’m off.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But how do you get back on board?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I do not come back, M. Aronnax; the _Nautilus_ comes to me.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“By your orders?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“By my orders. An electric thread connects us. I telegraph to it, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that is enough.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Really,” I said, astonished at these marvels, “nothing can be more","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"simple.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"After having passed by the cage of the staircase that led to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"platform, I saw a cabin six feet long, in which Conseil and Ned Land,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"enchanted with their repast, were devouring it with avidity. Then a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"door opened into a kitchen nine feet long, situated between the large","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"storerooms. There electricity, better than gas itself, did all the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cooking. The streams under the furnaces gave out to the sponges of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"platina a heat which was regularly kept up and distributed. They also","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"heated a distilling apparatus, which, by evaporation, furnished","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"excellent drinkable water. Near this kitchen was a bathroom comfortably","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"furnished, with hot and cold water taps.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Next to the kitchen was the berthroom of the vessel, sixteen feet long.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"But the door was shut, and I could not see the management of it, which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"might have given me an idea of the number of men employed on board the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At the bottom was a fourth partition that separated this office from","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the engine-room. A door opened, and I found myself in the compartment","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"where Captain Nemo—certainly an engineer of a very high order—had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"arranged his locomotive machinery. This engine-room, clearly lighted,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"did not measure less than sixty-five feet in length. It was divided","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"into two parts; the first contained the materials for producing","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"electricity, and the second the machinery that connected it with the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"screw. I examined it with great interest, in order to understand the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"machinery of the _Nautilus_.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“You see,” said the Captain, “I use Bunsen’s contrivances, not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Ruhmkorff’s. Those would not have been powerful enough. Bunsen’s are","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fewer in number, but strong and large, which experience proves to be","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the best. The electricity produced passes forward, where it works, by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"electro-magnets of great size, on a system of levers and cog-wheels","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that transmit the movement to the axle of the screw. This one, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"diameter of which is nineteen feet, and the thread twenty-three feet,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"performs about a hundred and twenty revolutions in a second.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“And you get then?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“A speed of fifty miles an hour.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I have seen the _Nautilus_ manœuvre before the _Abraham Lincoln_, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I have my own ideas as to its speed. But this is not enough. We must","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"see where we go. We must be able to direct it to the right, to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"left, above, below. How do you get to the great depths, where you find","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"an increasing resistance, which is rated by hundreds of atmospheres?","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"How do you return to the surface of the ocean? And how do you maintain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"yourselves in the requisite medium? Am I asking too much?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Not at all, Professor,” replied the Captain, with some hesitation;","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“since you may never leave this submarine boat. Come into the saloon,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"it is our usual study, and there you will learn all you want to know","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"about the _Nautilus_.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"CHAPTER XII","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"SOME FIGURES","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"A moment after we were seated on a divan in the saloon smoking. The","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain showed me a sketch that gave the plan, section, and elevation","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the _Nautilus_. Then he began his description in these words:—","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Here, M. Aronnax, are the several dimensions of the boat you are in.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"It is an elongated cylinder with conical ends. It is very like a cigar","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in shape, a shape already adopted in London in several constructions of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the same sort. The length of this cylinder, from stem to stern, is","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"exactly 232 feet, and its maximum breadth is twenty-six feet. It is not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"built quite like your long-voyage steamers, but its lines are","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sufficiently long, and its curves prolonged enough, to allow the water","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to slide off easily, and oppose no obstacle to its passage. These two","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"dimensions enable you to obtain by a simple calculation the surface and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cubic contents of the _Nautilus_. Its area measures 6032 feet; and its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"contents about 1500 cubic yards—that is to say, when completely","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"immersed it displaces 50,000 feet of water, or weighs 1500 tons.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“When I made the plans for this submarine vessel, I meant that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"nine-tenths should be submerged: consequently, it ought only to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"displace nine-tenths of its bulk—that is to say, only to weigh that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"number of tons. I ought not, therefore, to have exceeded that weight,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"constructing it on the aforesaid dimensions.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“The _Nautilus_ is composed of two hulls, one inside, the other","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"outside, joined by T-shaped irons, which render it very strong. Indeed,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"owing to this cellular arrangement it resists like a block, as if it","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"were solid. Its sides cannot yield; it coheres spontaneously, and not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"by the closeness of its rivets; and the homogenity of its construction,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"due to the perfect union of the materials, enables it to defy the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"roughest seas.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“These two hulls are composed of steel plates, whose density is from .7","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to .8 that of water. The first is not less than two inches and a half","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"thick and weighs 394 tons. The second envelope, the keel, twenty inches","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"high and ten thick, weighs alone sixty-two tons. The engine, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ballast, the several accessories and apparatus appendages, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"partitions and bulkheads, weigh 961.62 tons. Do you follow all this?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I do.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Then, when the _Nautilus_ is afloat under these circumstances,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"one-tenth is out of the water. Now, if I have made reservoirs of a size","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"equal to this tenth, or capable of holding 150 tons, and if I fill them","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with water, the boat, weighing then 1507 tons, will be completely","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"immersed. That would happen, Professor. These reservoirs are in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"lower parts of the _Nautilus_. I turn on taps and they fill, and the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"vessel sinks that had just been level with the surface.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well, Captain, but now we come to the real difficulty. I can","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"understand your rising to the surface; but diving below the surface,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"does not your submarine contrivance encounter a pressure, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"consequently undergo an upward thrust of one atmosphere for every","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"thirty feet of water, just about fifteen pounds per square inch?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Just so, sir.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Then, unless you quite fill the _Nautilus_, I do not see how you can","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"draw it down to those depths.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Professor, you must not confound statics with dynamics or you will be","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"exposed to grave errors. There is very little labour spent in attaining","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the lower regions of the ocean, for all bodies have a tendency to sink.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"When I wanted to find out the necessary increase of weight required to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sink the _Nautilus_, I had only to calculate the reduction of volume","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that sea-water acquires according to the depth.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“That is evident.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Now, if water is not absolutely incompressible, it is at least capable","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of very slight compression. Indeed, after the most recent calculations","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"this reduction is only .000436 of an atmosphere for each thirty feet of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"depth. If we want to sink 3000 feet, I should keep account of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"reduction of bulk under a pressure equal to that of a column of water","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of a thousand feet. The calculation is easily verified. Now, I have","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"supplementary reservoirs capable of holding a hundred tons. Therefore I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"can sink to a considerable depth. When I wish to rise to the level of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the sea, I only let off the water, and empty all the reservoirs if I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"want the _Nautilus_ to emerge from the tenth part of her total","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"capacity.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I had nothing to object to these reasonings.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I admit your calculations, Captain,” I replied; “I should be wrong to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"dispute them since daily experience confirms them; but I foresee a real","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"difficulty in the way.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“What, sir?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“When you are about 1000 feet deep, the walls of the _Nautilus_ bear a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pressure of 100 atmospheres. If, then, just now you were to empty the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"supplementary reservoirs, to lighten the vessel, and to go up to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"surface, the pumps must overcome the pressure of 100 atmospheres, which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"is 1500 pounds per square inch. From that a power——”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“That electricity alone can give,” said the Captain, hastily. “I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"repeat, sir, that the dynamic power of my engines is almost infinite.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The pumps of the _Nautilus_ have an enormous power, as you must have","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"observed when their jets of water burst like a torrent upon the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Abraham Lincoln_. Besides I use subsidiary reservoirs only to attain a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"mean depth of 750 to 1000 fathoms, and that with a view of managing my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"machines. Also, when I have a mind to visit the depths of the ocean","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"five or six miles below the surface, I make use of slower but not less","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"infallible means.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“What are they, Captain?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“That involves my telling you how the _Nautilus_ is worked.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I am impatient to learn.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“To steer this boat to starboard or port, to turn—in a word, following","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a horizontal plan, I use an ordinary rudder fixed on the back of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"stern-post, and with one wheel and some tackle to steer by. But I can","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"also make the _Nautilus_ rise and sink, and sink and rise, by a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"vertical movement by means of two inclined planes fastened to its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sides, opposite the centre of flotation, planes that move in every","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"direction, and that are worked by powerful levers from the interior. If","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the planes are kept parallel with the boat, it moves horizontally. If","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"slanted, the _Nautilus_, according to this inclination, and under the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"influence of the screw, either sinks diagonally or rises diagonally as","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"it suits me. And even if I wish to rise more quickly to the surface, I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ship the screw, and the pressure of the water causes the _Nautilus_ to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rise vertically like a balloon filled with hydrogen.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Bravo, Captain! But how can the steersman follow the route in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"middle of the waters?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“The steersman is placed in a glazed box, that is raised about the hull","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the _Nautilus_, and furnished with lenses.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Are these lenses capable of resisting such pressure?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Perfectly. Glass, which breaks at a blow, is, nevertheless, capable of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"offering considerable resistance. During some experiments of fishing by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"electric light in 1864 in the Northern Seas, we saw plates less than a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"third of an inch thick resist a pressure of sixteen atmospheres. Now,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the glass that I use is not less than thirty times thicker.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Granted. But, after all, in order to see, the light must exceed the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"darkness, and in the midst of the darkness in the water, how can you","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"see?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Behind the steersman’s cage is placed a powerful electric reflector,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the rays from which light up the sea for half a mile in front.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Ah! bravo, bravo, Captain! Now I can account for this phosphorescence","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in the supposed narwhal that puzzled us so. I now ask you if the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"boarding of the _Nautilus_ and of the _Scotia_, that has made such a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"noise, has been the result of a chance rencontre?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Quite accidental, sir. I was sailing only one fathom below the surface","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the water, when the shock came. It had no bad result.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“None, sir. But now, about your rencontre with the _Abraham Lincoln?_”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Professor, I am sorry for one of the best vessels in the American","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"navy; but they attacked me, and I was bound to defend myself. I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"contented myself, however, with putting the frigate _hors de combat;_","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"she will not have any difficulty in getting repaired at the next port.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Ah, Commander! your _Nautilus_ is certainly a marvellous boat.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, Professor; and I love it as if it were part of myself. If danger","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"threatens one of your vessels on the ocean, the first impression is the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"feeling of an abyss above and below. On the _Nautilus_ men’s hearts","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"never fail them. No defects to be afraid of, for the double shell is as","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"firm as iron; no rigging to attend to; no sails for the wind to carry","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"away; no boilers to burst; no fire to fear, for the vessel is made of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"iron, not of wood; no coal to run short, for electricity is the only","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"mechanical agent; no collision to fear, for it alone swims in deep","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"water; no tempest to brave, for when it dives below the water, it","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"reaches absolute tranquillity. There, sir! that is the perfection of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"vessels! And if it is true that the engineer has more confidence in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"vessel than the builder, and the builder than the captain himself, you","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"understand the trust I repose in my _Nautilus;_ for I am at once","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"captain, builder, and engineer.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But how could you construct this wonderful _Nautilus_ in secret?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Each separate portion, M. Aronnax, was brought from different parts of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the globe. The keel was forged at Creusot, the shaft of the screw at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Penn & Co.’s, London, the iron plates of the hull at Laird’s of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Liverpool, the screw itself at Scott’s at Glasgow. The reservoirs were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"made by Cail & Co. at Paris, the engine by Krupp in Prussia, its beak","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in Motala’s workshop in Sweden, its mathematical instruments by Hart","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Brothers, of New York, etc.; and each of these people had my orders","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"under different names.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But these parts had to be put together and arranged?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Professor, I had set up my workshops upon a desert island in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ocean. There my workmen, that is to say, the brave men that I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"instructed and educated, and myself have put together our _Nautilus_.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Then when the work was finished, fire destroyed all trace of our","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"proceedings on this island, that I could have jumped over if I had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"liked.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Then the cost of this vessel is great?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“M. Aronnax, an iron vessel costs £145 per ton. Now the _Nautilus_","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"weighed 1500. It came therefore to £67,500, and £80,000 more for","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fitting it up, and about £200,000 with the works of art and the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"collections it contains.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“One last question, Captain Nemo.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Ask it, Professor.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“You are rich?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Immensely rich, sir; and I could, without missing it, pay the national","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"debt of France.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I stared at the singular person who spoke thus. Was he playing upon my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"credulity? The future would decide that.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"THE BLACK RIVER","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The portion of the terrestrial globe which is covered by water is","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"estimated at upwards of eighty millions of acres. This fluid mass","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"comprises two billions two hundred and fifty millions of cubic miles,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"forming a spherical body of a diameter of sixty leagues, the weight of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which would be three quintillions of tons. To comprehend the meaning of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"these figures, it is necessary to observe that a quintillion is to a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"billion as a billion is to unity; in other words, there are as many","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"billions in a quintillion as there are units in a billion. This mass of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fluid is equal to about the quantity of water which would be discharged","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"by all the rivers of the earth in forty thousand years.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"During the geological epochs, the igneous period succeeded to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"aqeous. The ocean originally prevailed everywhere. Then by degrees, in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the silurian period, the tops of the mountains began to appear, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"islands emerged, then disappeared in partial deluges, reappeared,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"became settled, formed continents, till at length the earth became","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"geographically arranged, as we see in the present day. The solid had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"wrested from the liquid thirty-seven million six hundred and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fifty-seven square miles, equal to twelve billion nine hundred and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sixty millions of acres.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The shape of continents allows us to divide the waters into five great","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"portions: the Arctic or Frozen Ocean, the Antarctic or Frozen Ocean,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the Indian, the Atlantic, and the Pacific Oceans.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The Pacific Ocean extends from north to south between the two polar","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"circles, and from east to west between Asia and America, over an extent","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of 145 degrees of longitude. It is the quietest of seas; its currents","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"are broad and slow, it has medium tides, and abundant rain. Such was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the ocean that my fate destined me first to travel over under these","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"strange conditions.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Sir,” said Captain Nemo, “we will, if you please, take our bearings","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and fix the starting-point of this voyage. It is a quarter to twelve; I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"will go up again to the surface.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The Captain pressed an electric clock three times. The pumps began to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"drive the water from the tanks; the needle of the manometer marked by a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"different pressure the ascent of the _Nautilus_, then it stopped.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“We have arrived,” said the Captain.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I went to the central staircase which opened on to the platform,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"clambered up the iron steps, and found myself on the upper part of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The platform was only three feet out of water. The front and back of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the _Nautilus_ was of that spindle-shape which caused it justly to be","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"compared to a cigar. I noticed that its iron plates, slightly","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"overlaying each other, resembled the shell which clothes the bodies of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"our large terrestrial reptiles. It explained to me how natural it was,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in spite of all glasses, that this boat should have been taken for a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"marine animal.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Toward the middle of the platform the long-boat, half buried in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hull of the vessel, formed a slight excrescence. Fore and aft rose two","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cages of medium height with inclined sides, and partly closed by thick","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"lenticular glasses; one destined for the steersman who directed the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_, the other containing a brilliant lantern to give light on","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the road.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The sea was beautiful, the sky pure. Scarcely could the long vehicle","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"feel the broad undulations of the ocean. A light breeze from the east","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rippled the surface of the waters. The horizon, free from fog, made","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"observation easy. Nothing was in sight. Not a quicksand, not an island.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"A vast desert.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo, by the help of his sextant, took the altitude of the sun,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which ought also to give the latitude. He waited for some moments till","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"its disc touched the horizon. Whilst taking observations not a muscle","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"moved, the instrument could not have been more motionless in a hand of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"marble.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"[Illustration] Captain Nemo took the Sun’s altitude","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Twelve o’clock, sir,” said he. “When you like——”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I cast a last look upon the sea, slightly yellowed by the Japanese","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"coast, and descended to the saloon.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“And now, sir, I leave you to your studies,” added the Captain; “our","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"course is E.N.E., our depth is twenty-six fathoms. Here are maps on a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"large scale by which you may follow it. The saloon is at your disposal,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and with your permission, I will retire.” Captain Nemo bowed, and I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"remained alone, lost in thoughts all bearing on the commander of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"For a whole hour was I deep in these reflections, seeking to pierce","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"this mystery so interesting to me. Then my eyes fell upon the vast","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"planisphere spread upon the table, and I placed my finger on the very","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"spot where the given latitude and longitude crossed.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The sea has its large rivers like the continents. They are special","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"currents known by their temperature and their colour. The most","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"remarkable of these is known by the name of the Gulf Stream. Science","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"has decided on the globe the direction of five principal currents: one","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in the North Atlantic, a second in the South, a third in the North","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Pacific, a fourth in the South, and a fifth in the Southern Indian","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Ocean. It is even probable that a sixth current existed at one time or","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"another in the Northern Indian Ocean, when the Caspian and Aral Seas","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"formed but one vast sheet of water.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At this point indicated on the planisphere one of these currents was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rolling, the Kuro-Scivo of the Japanese, the Black River, which,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"leaving the Gulf of Bengal, where it is warmed by the perpendicular","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rays of a tropical sun, crosses the Straits of Malacca along the coast","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of Asia, turns into the North Pacific to the Aleutian Islands, carrying","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with it trunks of camphor-trees and other indigenous productions, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"edging the waves of the ocean with the pure indigo of its warm water.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"It was this current that the _Nautilus_ was to follow. I followed it","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with my eye; saw it lose itself in the vastness of the Pacific, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"felt myself drawn with it, when Ned Land and Conseil appeared at the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"door of the saloon.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"My two brave companions remained petrified at the sight of the wonders","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"spread before them.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Where are we, where are we?” exclaimed the Canadian. “In the museum at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Quebec?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“My friends,” I answered, making a sign for them to enter, “you are not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in Canada, but on board the _Nautilus_, fifty yards below the level of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the sea.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But, M. Aronnax,” said Ned Land, “can you tell me how many men there","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"are on board? Ten, twenty, fifty, a hundred?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I cannot answer you, Mr. Land; it is better to abandon for a time all","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"idea of seizing the _Nautilus_ or escaping from it. This ship is a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"masterpiece of modern industry, and I should be sorry not to have seen","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"it. Many people would accept the situation forced upon us, if only to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"move amongst such wonders. So be quiet and let us try and see what","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"passes around us.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“See!” exclaimed the harpooner, “but we can see nothing in this iron","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"prison! We are walking—we are sailing—blindly.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Ned Land had scarcely pronounced these words when all was suddenly","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"darkness. The luminous ceiling was gone, and so rapidly that my eyes","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"received a painful impression.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"We remained mute, not stirring, and not knowing what surprise awaited","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"us, whether agreeable or disagreeable. A sliding noise was heard: one","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"would have said that panels were working at the sides of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“It is the end of the end!” said Ned Land.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Suddenly light broke at each side of the saloon, through two oblong","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"openings. The liquid mass appeared vividly lit up by the electric","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"gleam. Two crystal plates separated us from the sea. At first I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"trembled at the thought that this frail partition might break, but","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"strong bands of copper bound them, giving an almost infinite power of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"resistance.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The sea was distinctly visible for a mile all round the _Nautilus_.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"What a spectacle! What pen can describe it? Who could paint the effects","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the light through those transparent sheets of water, and the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"softness of the successive gradations from the lower to the superior","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"strata of the ocean?","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"We know the transparency of the sea and that its clearness is far","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"beyond that of rock-water. The mineral and organic substances which it","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"holds in suspension heightens its transparency. In certain parts of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ocean at the Antilles, under seventy-five fathoms of water, can be seen","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with surprising clearness a bed of sand. The penetrating power of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"solar rays does not seem to cease for a depth of one hundred and fifty","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fathoms. But in this middle fluid travelled over by the _Nautilus_, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"electric brightness was produced even in the bosom of the waves. It was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"no longer luminous water, but liquid light.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"On each side a window opened into this unexplored abyss. The obscurity","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the saloon showed to advantage the brightness outside, and we looked","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"out as if this pure crystal had been the glass of an immense aquarium.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“You wished to see, friend Ned; well, you see now.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Curious! curious!” muttered the Canadian, who, forgetting his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ill-temper, seemed to submit to some irresistible attraction; “and one","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"would come further than this to admire such a sight!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Ah!” thought I to myself, “I understand the life of this man; he has","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"made a world apart for himself, in which he treasures all his greatest","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"wonders.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"For two whole hours an aquatic army escorted the _Nautilus_. During","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"their games, their bounds, while rivalling each other in beauty,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"brightness, and velocity, I distinguished the green labre; the banded","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"mullet, marked by a double line of black; the round-tailed goby, of a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"white colour, with violet spots on the back; the Japanese scombrus, a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"beautiful mackerel of those seas, with a blue body and silvery head;","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the brilliant azurors, whose name alone defies description; some banded","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"spares, with variegated fins of blue and yellow; the woodcocks of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"seas, some specimens of which attain a yard in length; Japanese","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"salamanders, spider lampreys, serpents six feet long, with eyes small","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and lively, and a huge mouth bristling with teeth; with many other","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"species.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Our imagination was kept at its height, interjections followed quickly","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"on each other. Ned named the fish, and Conseil classed them. I was in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ecstasies with the vivacity of their movements and the beauty of their","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"forms. Never had it been given to me to surprise these animals, alive","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and at liberty, in their natural element. I will not mention all the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"varieties which passed before my dazzled eyes, all the collection of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the seas of China and Japan. These fish, more numerous than the birds","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the air, came, attracted, no doubt, by the brilliant focus of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"electric light.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Suddenly there was daylight in the saloon, the iron panels closed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"again, and the enchanting vision disappeared. But for a long time I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"dreamt on till my eyes fell on the instruments hanging on the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"partition. The compass still showed the course to be E.N.E., the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"manometer indicated a pressure of five atmospheres, equivalent to a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"depth of twenty-five fathoms, and the electric log gave a speed of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fifteen miles an hour. I expected Captain Nemo, but he did not appear.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The clock marked the hour of five.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Ned Land and Conseil returned to their cabin, and I retired to my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"chamber. My dinner was ready. It was composed of turtle soup made of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the most delicate hawksbills, of a surmullet served with puff paste","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"(the liver of which, prepared by itself, was most delicious), and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fillets of the emperor-holocanthus, the savour of which seemed to me","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"superior even to salmon.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I passed the evening reading, writing, and thinking. Then sleep","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"overpowered me, and I stretched myself on my couch of zostera, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"slept profoundly, whilst the _Nautilus_ was gliding rapidly through the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"current of the Black River.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"A NOTE OF INVITATION","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The next day was the 9th of November. I awoke after a long sleep of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"twelve hours. Conseil came, according to custom, to know “how I had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"passed the night,” and to offer his services. He had left his friend","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the Canadian sleeping like a man who had never done anything else all","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"his life. I let the worthy fellow chatter as he pleased, without caring","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to answer him. I was pre-occupied by the absence of the Captain during","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"our sitting of the day before, and hoping to see him to-day.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"As soon as I was dressed I went into the saloon. It was deserted.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I plunged into the study of the shell treasures hidden behind the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"glasses. I revelled also in great herbals filled with the rarest marine","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"plants, which, although dried up, retained their lovely colours.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Amongst these precious hydrophytes I remarked some vorticellæ,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pavonariæ, delicate ceramies with scarlet tints, some fan-shaped agari,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and some natabuli like flat mushrooms, which at one time used to be","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"classed as zoophytes; in short, a perfect series of algæ.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The whole day passed without my being honoured by a visit from Captain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Nemo. The panels of the saloon did not open. Perhaps they did not wish","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"us to tire of these beautiful things.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The course of the _Nautilus_ was E.N.E., her speed twelve knots, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"depth below the surface between twenty-five and thirty fathoms.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The next day, 10th of November, the same desertion, the same solitude.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I did not see one of the ship’s crew: Ned and Conseil spent the greater","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"part of the day with me. They were astonished at the inexplicable","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"absence of the Captain. Was this singular man ill?—had he altered his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"intentions with regard to us?","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"After all, as Conseil said, we enjoyed perfect liberty, we were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"delicately and abundantly fed. Our host kept to his terms of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"treaty. We could not complain, and, indeed, the singularity of our fate","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"reserved such wonderful compensation for us, that we had no right to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"accuse it as yet.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"That day I commenced the journal of these adventures which has enabled","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"me to relate them with more scrupulous exactitude and minute detail. I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"wrote it on paper made from the zostera marina.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"11th November, early in the morning. The fresh air spreading over the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"interior of the _Nautilus_ told me that we had come to the surface of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the ocean to renew our supply of oxygen. I directed my steps to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"central staircase, and mounted the platform.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"It was six o’clock, the weather was cloudy, the sea grey but calm.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Scarcely a billow. Captain Nemo, whom I hoped to meet, would he be","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"there? I saw no one but the steersman imprisoned in his glass cage.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Seated upon the projection formed by the hull of the pinnace, I inhaled","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the salt breeze with delight.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"By degrees the fog disappeared under the action of the sun’s rays, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"radiant orb rose from behind the eastern horizon. The sea flamed under","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"its glance like a train of gunpowder. The clouds scattered in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"heights were coloured with lively tints of beautiful shades, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"numerous “mare’s tails,” which betokened wind for that day. But what","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was wind to this _Nautilus_ which tempests could not frighten!","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I was admiring this joyous rising of the sun, so gay, and so","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"lifegiving, when I heard steps approaching the platform. I was prepared","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to salute Captain Nemo, but it was his second (whom I had already seen","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"on the Captain’s first visit) who appeared. He advanced on the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"platform, not seeming to see me. With his powerful glass to his eye he","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"scanned every point of the horizon with great attention. This","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"examination over, he approached the panel and pronounced a sentence in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"exactly these terms. I have remembered it, for every morning it was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"repeated under exactly the same conditions. It was thus worded—","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Nautron respoc lorni virch.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"What it meant I could not say.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"These words pronounced, the second descended. I thought that the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_ was about to return to its submarine navigation. I regained","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the panel and returned to my chamber.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Five days sped thus, without any change in our situation. Every morning","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I mounted the platform. The same phrase was pronounced by the same","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"individual. But Captain Nemo did not appear.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I had made up my mind that I should never see him again, when, on the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"16th November, on returning to my room with Ned and Conseil, I found","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"upon my table a note addressed to me. I opened it impatiently. It was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"written in a bold, clear hand, the characters rather pointed, recalling","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the German type. The note was worded as follows—","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"16th of _November_, 1867.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"TO PROFESSOR ARONNAX, On board the _Nautilus_.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo invites Professor Aronnax to a hunting-party, which will","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"take place to-morrow morning in the forests of the island of Crespo. He","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hopes that nothing will prevent the Professor from being present, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"he will with pleasure see him joined by his companions.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"CAPTAIN NEMO, Commander of the _Nautilus_.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“A hunt!” exclaimed Ned.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“And in the forests of the island of Crespo!” added Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Oh! then the gentleman is going on _terra firma?_” replied Ned Land.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“That seems to me to be clearly indicated,” said I, reading the letter","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"once more.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well, we must accept,” said the Canadian. “But once more on dry","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ground, we shall know what to do. Indeed, I shall not be sorry to eat a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"piece of fresh venison.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Without seeking to reconcile what was contradictory between Captain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Nemo’s manifest aversion to islands and continents, and his invitation","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to hunt in a forest, I contented myself with replying—","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Let us first see where the island of Crespo is.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I consulted the planisphere, and in 32° 40′ north lat. and 157° 50′","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"west long., I found a small island, recognised in 1801 by Captain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Crespo, and marked in the ancient Spanish maps as Rocca de la Plata,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the meaning of which is “The Silver Rock.” We were then about eighteen","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hundred miles from our starting-point, and the course of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_, a little changed, was bringing it back towards the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"south-east.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I showed this little rock lost in the midst of the North Pacific to my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"companions.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“If Captain Nemo does sometimes go on dry ground,” said I, “he at least","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"chooses desert islands.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Ned Land shrugged his shoulders without speaking, and Conseil and he","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"left me.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"After supper, which was served by the steward mute and impassive, I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"went to bed, not without some anxiety.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The next morning, the 17th of November, on awakening, I felt that the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_ was perfectly still. I dressed quickly and entered the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"saloon.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo was there, waiting for me. He rose, bowed, and asked me if","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"it was convenient for me to accompany him. As he made no allusion to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"his absence during the last eight days, I did not mention it, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"simply answered that my companions and myself were ready to follow him.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"We entered the dining-room, where breakfast was served.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“M. Aronnax,” said the Captain, “pray, share my breakfast without","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ceremony; we will chat as we eat. For though I promised you a walk in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the forest, I did not undertake to find hotels there. So breakfast as a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"man who will most likely not have his dinner till very late.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I did honour to the repast. It was composed of several kinds of fish,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and slices of holothuridæ (excellent zoophytes), and different sorts of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sea-weed. Our drink consisted of pure water, to which the Captain added","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"some drops of a fermented liquor, extracted by the Kamschatcha method","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"from a sea-weed known under the name of _Rhodomenia palmata_. Captain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Nemo ate at first without saying a word. Then he began—","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Sir, when I proposed to you to hunt in my submarine forest of Crespo,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"you evidently thought me mad. Sir, you should never judge lightly of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"any man.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But Captain, believe me——”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Be kind enough to listen, and you will then see whether you have any","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cause to accuse me of folly and contradiction.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I listen.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“You know as well as I do, Professor, that man can live under water,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"providing he carries with him a sufficient supply of breathable air. In","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"submarine works, the workman, clad in an impervious dress, with his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"head in a metal helmet, receives air from above by means of forcing","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pumps and regulators.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“That is a diving apparatus,” said I.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Just so, but under these conditions the man is not at liberty; he is","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"attached to the pump which sends him air through an india-rubber tube,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and if we were obliged to be thus held to the _Nautilus_, we could not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"go far.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“And the means of getting free?” I asked.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“It is to use the Rouquayrol apparatus, invented by two of your own","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"countrymen, which I have brought to perfection for my own use, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which will allow you to risk yourself under these new physiological","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"conditions without any organ whatever suffering. It consists of a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"reservoir of thick iron plates, in which I store the air under a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pressure of fifty atmospheres. This reservoir is fixed on the back by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"means of braces, like a soldier’s knapsack. Its upper part forms a box","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in which the air is kept by means of a bellows, and therefore cannot","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"escape unless at its normal tension. In the Rouquayrol apparatus such","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"as we use, two india-rubber pipes leave this box and join a sort of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"tent which holds the nose and mouth; one is to introduce fresh air, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"other to let out the foul, and the tongue closes one or the other","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"according to the wants of the respirator. But I, in encountering great","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pressures at the bottom of the sea, was obliged to shut my head, like","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that of a diver in a ball of copper; and it is to this ball of copper","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that the two pipes, the inspirator and the expirator, open.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Perfectly, Captain Nemo; but the air that you carry with you must soon","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"be used; when it only contains fifteen per cent. of oxygen it is no","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"longer fit to breathe.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Right! But I told you, M. Aronnax, that the pumps of the _Nautilus_","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"allow me to store the air under considerable pressure, and on those","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"conditions the reservoir of the apparatus can furnish breathable air","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"for nine or ten hours.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I have no further objections to make,” I answered; “I will only ask","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"you one thing, Captain—how can you light your road at the bottom of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sea?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“With the Ruhmkorff apparatus, M. Aronnax; one is carried on the back,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the other is fastened to the waist. It is composed of a Bunsen pile,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which I do not work with bichromate of potash, but with sodium. A wire","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"is introduced which collects the electricity produced, and directs it","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"towards a particularly made lantern. In this lantern is a spiral glass","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which contains a small quantity of carbonic gas. When the apparatus is","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"at work this gas becomes luminous, giving out a white and continuous","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"light. Thus provided, I can breathe and I can see.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Captain Nemo, to all my objections you make such crushing answers,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that I dare no longer doubt. But if I am forced to admit the Rouquayrol","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and Ruhmkorff apparatus, I must be allowed some reservations with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"regard to the gun I am to carry.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But it is not a gun for powder,” answered the Captain.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Then it is an air-gun.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Doubtless! How would you have me manufacture gunpowder on board,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"without either saltpetre, sulphur, or charcoal?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Besides,” I added, “to fire under water in a medium eight hundred and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fifty-five times denser than the air, we must conquer very considerable","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"resistance.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“That would be no difficulty. There exist guns, according to Fulton,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"perfected in England by Philip Coles and Burley, in France by Furcy,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and in Italy by Landi, which are furnished with a peculiar system of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"closing, which can fire under these conditions. But I repeat, having no","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"powder, I use air under great pressure, which the pumps of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_ furnish abundantly.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But this air must be rapidly used?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well, have I not my Rouquayrol reservoir, which can furnish it at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"need? A tap is all that is required. Besides, M. Aronnax, you must see","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"yourself that, during our submarine hunt, we can spend but little air","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and but few balls.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But it seems to me that in this twilight, and in the midst of this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fluid, which is very dense compared with the atmosphere, shots could","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"not go far, nor easily prove mortal.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Sir, on the contrary, with this gun every blow is mortal; and however","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"lightly the animal is touched, it falls as if struck by a thunderbolt.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Why?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Because the balls sent by this gun are not ordinary balls, but little","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cases of glass (invented by Leniebroek, an Austrian chemist), of which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I have a large supply. These glass cases are covered with a case of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"steel, and weighted with a pellet of lead; they are real Leyden","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"bottles, into which the electricity is forced to a very high tension.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"With the slightest shock they are discharged, and the animal, however","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"strong it may be, falls dead. I must tell you that these cases are size","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"number four, and that the charge for an ordinary gun would be ten.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I will argue no longer,” I replied, rising from the table; “I have","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"nothing left me but to take my gun. At all events, I will go where you","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"go.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo then led me aft; and in passing before Ned’s and Conseil’s","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cabin, I called my two companions, who followed immediately. We then","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"came to a kind of cell near the machinery-room, in which we were to put","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"on our walking-dress.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"CHAPTER XV","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"A WALK ON THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"This cell was, to speak correctly, the arsenal and wardrobe of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_. A dozen diving apparatuses hung from the partition, waiting","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"our use.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Ned Land, on seeing them, showed evident repugnance to dress himself in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"one.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But, my worthy Ned, the forests of the Island of Crespo are nothing","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"but submarine forests.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Good!” said the disappointed harpooner, who saw his dreams of fresh","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"meat fade away. “And you, M. Aronnax, are you going to dress yourself","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in those clothes?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“There is no alternative, Master Ned.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“As you please, sir,” replied the harpooner, shrugging his shoulders;","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“but as for me, unless I am forced, I will never get into one.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“No one will force you, Master Ned,” said Captain Nemo.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Is Conseil going to risk it?” asked Ned.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I follow my master wherever he goes,” replied Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At the Captain’s call two of the ship’s crew came to help us to dress","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in these heavy and impervious clothes, made of india-rubber without","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"seam, and constructed expressly to resist considerable pressure. One","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"would have thought it a suit of armour, both supple and resisting. This","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"suit formed trousers and waistcoat. The trousers were finished off with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"thick boots, weighted with heavy leaden soles. The texture of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"waistcoat was held together by bands of copper, which crossed the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"chest, protecting it from the great pressure of the water, and leaving","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the lungs free to act; the sleeves ended in gloves, which in no way","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"restrained the movement of the hands. There was a vast difference","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"noticeable between these consummate apparatuses and the old cork","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"breastplates, jackets, and other contrivances in vogue during the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"eighteenth century.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo and one of his companions (a sort of Hercules, who must","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"have possessed great strength), Conseil, and myself, were soon","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"enveloped in the dresses. There remained nothing more to be done but to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"enclose our heads in the metal box. But before proceeding to this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"operation, I asked the Captain’s permission to examine the guns we were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to carry.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"One of the _Nautilus_ men gave me a simple gun, the butt end of which,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"made of steel, hollow in the centre, was rather large. It served as a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"reservoir for compressed air, which a valve, worked by a spring,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"allowed to escape into a metal tube. A box of projectiles, in a groove","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in the thickness of the butt end, contained about twenty of these","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"electric balls, which, by means of a spring, were forced into the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"barrel of the gun. As soon as one shot was fired, another was ready.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Captain Nemo,” said I, “this arm is perfect, and easily handled: I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"only ask to be allowed to try it. But how shall we gain the bottom of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the sea?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“At this moment, Professor, the _Nautilus_ is stranded in five fathoms,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and we have nothing to do but to start.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But how shall we get off?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“You shall see.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo thrust his head into the helmet, Conseil and I did the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"same, not without hearing an ironical “Good sport!” from the Canadian.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The upper part of our dress terminated in a copper collar upon which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was screwed the metal helmet. Three holes, protected by thick glass,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"allowed us to see in all directions, by simply turning our head in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"interior of the head-dress. As soon as it was in position, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Rouquayrol apparatus on our backs began to act; and, for my part, I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"could breathe with ease.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"With the Ruhmkorff lamp hanging from my belt, and the gun in my hand, I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was ready to set out. But to speak the truth, imprisoned in these heavy","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"garments, and glued to the deck by my leaden soles, it was impossible","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"for me to take a step.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"[Illustration] I was ready to set out","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"But this state of things was provided for. I felt myself being pushed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"into a little room contiguous to the wardrobe-room. My companions","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"followed, towed along in the same way. I heard a water-tight door,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"furnished with stopper-plates, close upon us, and we were wrapped in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"profound darkness.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"After some minutes, a loud hissing was heard. I felt the cold mount","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"from my feet to my chest. Evidently from some part of the vessel they","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"had, by means of a tap, given entrance to the water, which was invading","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"us, and with which the room was soon filled. A second door cut in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"side of the _Nautilus_ then opened. We saw a faint light. In another","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"instant our feet trod the bottom of the sea.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"And now, how can I retrace the impression left upon me by that walk","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"under the waters? Words are impotent to relate such wonders! Captain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Nemo walked in front, his companion followed some steps behind. Conseil","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and I remained near each other, as if an exchange of words had been","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"possible through our metallic cases. I no longer felt the weight of my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"clothing, or of my shoes, of my reservoir of air, or my thick helmet,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in the midst of which my head rattled like an almond in its shell.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The light, which lit the soil thirty feet below the surface of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ocean, astonished me by its power. The solar rays shone through the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"watery mass easily, and dissipated all colour, and I clearly","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"distinguished objects at a distance of a hundred and fifty yards.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Beyond that the tints darkened into fine gradations of ultramarine, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"faded into vague obscurity. Truly this water which surrounded me was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"but another air denser than the terrestrial atmosphere, but almost as","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"transparent. Above me was the calm surface of the sea.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"We were walking on fine, even sand, not wrinkled, as on a flat shore,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which retains the impression of the billows. This dazzling carpet,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"really a reflector, repelled the rays of the sun with wonderful","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"intensity, which accounted for the vibration which penetrated every","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"atom of liquid. Shall I be believed when I say that, at the depth of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"thirty feet, I could see as if I was in broad daylight?","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"For a quarter of an hour I trod on this sand, sown with the impalpable","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"dust of shells. The hull of the _Nautilus_, resembling a long shoal,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"disappeared by degrees; but its lantern, when darkness should overtake","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"us in the waters, would help to guide us on board by its distinct rays.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Soon forms of objects outlined in the distance were discernible. I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"recognised magnificent rocks, hung with a tapestry of zoophytes of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"most beautiful kind, and I was at first struck by the peculiar effect","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of this medium.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"It was then ten in the morning; the rays of the sun struck the surface","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the waves at rather an oblique angle, and at the touch of their","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"light, decomposed by refraction as through a prism, flowers, rocks,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"plants, shells, and polypi were shaded at the edges by the seven solar","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"colours. It was marvellous, a feast for the eyes, this complication of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"coloured tints, a perfect kaleidoscope of green, yellow, orange,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"violet, indigo, and blue; in one word, the whole palette of an","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"enthusiastic colourist! Why could I not communicate to Conseil the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"lively sensations which were mounting to my brain, and rival him in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"expressions of admiration? For aught I knew, Captain Nemo and his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"companion might be able to exchange thoughts by means of signs","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"previously agreed upon. So, for want of better, I talked to myself; I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"declaimed in the copper box which covered my head, thereby expending","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"more air in vain words than was perhaps expedient.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Various kinds of isis, clusters of pure tuft-coral, prickly fungi, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"anemones formed a brilliant garden of flowers, enamelled with porphitæ,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"decked with their collarettes of blue tentacles, sea-stars studding the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sandy bottom, together with asterophytons like fine lace embroidered by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the hands of naïads, whose festoons were waved by the gentle","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"undulations caused by our walk. It was a real grief to me to crush","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"under my feet the brilliant specimens of molluscs which strewed the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ground by thousands, of hammer-heads, donaciae (veritable bounding","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shells), of staircases, and red helmet-shells, angel-wings, and many","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"others produced by this inexhaustible ocean. But we were bound to walk,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"so we went on, whilst above our heads waved shoals of physalides","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"leaving their tentacles to float in their train, medusæ whose umbrellas","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of opal or rose-pink, escalloped with a band of blue, sheltered us from","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the rays of the sun and fiery pelagiæ, which, in the darkness, would","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"have strewn our path with phosphorescent light.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"All these wonders I saw in the space of a quarter of a mile, scarcely","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"stopping, and following Captain Nemo, who beckoned me on by signs. Soon","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the nature of the soil changed; to the sandy plain succeeded an extent","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of slimy mud, which the Americans call “ooze,” composed of equal parts","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of silicious and calcareous shells. We then travelled over a plain of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sea-weed of wild and luxuriant vegetation. This sward was of close","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"texture, and soft to the feet, and rivalled the softest carpet woven by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the hand of man. But whilst verdure was spread at our feet, it did not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"abandon our heads. A light network of marine plants, of that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"inexhaustible family of sea-weeds of which more than two thousand kinds","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"are known, grew on the surface of the water. I saw long ribbons of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fucus floating, some globular, others tuberous; laurenciæ and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cladostephi of most delicate foliage, and some rhodomeniæ palmatæ,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"resembling the fan of a cactus. I noticed that the green plants kept","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"nearer the top of the sea, whilst the red were at a greater depth,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"leaving to the black or brown hydrophytes the care of forming gardens","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and parterres in the remote beds of the ocean.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"We had quitted the _Nautilus_ about an hour and a half. It was near","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"noon; I knew by the perpendicularity of the sun’s rays, which were no","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"longer refracted. The magical colours disappeared by degrees, and the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shades of emerald and sapphire were effaced. We walked with a regular","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"step, which rang upon the ground with astonishing intensity; the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"slightest noise was transmitted with a quickness to which the ear is","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"unaccustomed on the earth; indeed, water is a better conductor of sound","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"than air, in the ratio of four to one. At this period the earth sloped","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"downwards; the light took a uniform tint. We were at a depth of a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hundred and five yards and twenty inches, undergoing a pressure of six","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"atmospheres.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At this depth I could still see the rays of the sun, though feebly; to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"their intense brilliancy had succeeded a reddish twilight, the lowest","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"state between day and night; but we could still see well enough; it was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"not necessary to resort to the Ruhmkorff apparatus as yet. At this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"moment Captain Nemo stopped; he waited till I joined him, and then","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pointed to an obscure mass, looming in the shadow, at a short distance.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“It is the forest of the Island of Crespo,” thought I;—and I was not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"mistaken.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"CHAPTER XVI","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"A SUBMARINE FOREST","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"We had at last arrived on the borders of this forest, doubtless one of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the finest of Captain Nemo’s immense domains. He looked upon it as his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"own, and considered he had the same right over it that the first men","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"had in the first days of the world. And, indeed, who would have","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"disputed with him the possession of this submarine property? What other","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hardier pioneer would come, hatchet in hand, to cut down the dark","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"copses?","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"This forest was composed of large tree-plants; and the moment we","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"penetrated under its vast arcades, I was struck by the singular","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"position of their branches—a position I had not yet observed.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Not a herb which carpeted the ground, not a branch which clothed the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"trees, was either broken or bent, nor did they extend horizontally; all","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"stretched up to the surface of the ocean. Not a filament, not a ribbon,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"however thin they might be, but kept as straight as a rod of iron. The","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fuci and llianas grew in rigid perpendicular lines, due to the density","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the element which had produced them. Motionless, yet when bent to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"one side by the hand, they directly resumed their former position.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Truly it was the region of perpendicularity!","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I soon accustomed myself to this fantastic position, as well as to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"comparative darkness which surrounded us. The soil of the forest seemed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"covered with sharp blocks, difficult to avoid. The submarine flora","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"struck me as being very perfect, and richer even than it would have","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"been in the arctic or tropical zones, where these productions are not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"so plentiful. But for some minutes I involuntarily confounded the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"genera, taking zoophytes for hydrophytes, animals for plants; and who","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"would not have been mistaken? The fauna and the flora are too closely","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"allied in this submarine world.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"These plants are self-propagated, and the principle of their existence","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"is in the water, which upholds and nourishes them. The greater number,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"instead of leaves, shot forth blades of capricious shapes, comprised","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"within a scale of colours,—pink, carmine, green, olive, fawn, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"brown. I saw there (but not dried up, as our specimens of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_ are) pavonari spread like a fan, as if to catch the breeze;","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"scarlet ceramies, whose laminaries extended their edible shoots of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fern-shaped nereocysti, which grow to a height of fifteen feet;","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"clusters of acetabuli, whose stems increase in size upwards; and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"numbers of other marine plants, all devoid of flowers!","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Curious anomaly, fantastic element!” said an ingenious naturalist, “in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which the animal kingdom blossoms, and the vegetable does not!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Under these numerous shrubs (as large as trees of the temperate zone),","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and under their damp shadow, were massed together real bushes of living","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"flowers, hedges of zoophytes, on which blossomed some zebrameandrines,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with crooked grooves, some yellow caryophylliæ; and, to complete the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"allusion, the fish-flies flew from branch to branch like a swarm of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"humming-birds, whilst yellow lepisacomthi, with bristling jaws,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"dactylopteri, and monocentrides rose at our feet like a flight of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"snipes.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"In about an hour Captain Nemo gave the signal to halt. I, for my part,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was not sorry, and we stretched ourselves under an arbour of alariæ,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the long thin blades of which stood up like arrows.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"This short rest seemed delicious to me; there was nothing wanting but","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the charm of conversation; but, impossible to speak, impossible to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"answer, I only put my great copper head to Conseil’s. I saw the worthy","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fellow’s eyes glistening with delight, and to show his satisfaction, he","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shook himself in his breastplate of air in the most comical way in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"world.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"After four hours of this walking I was surprised not to find myself","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"dreadfully hungry. How to account for this state of the stomach I could","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"not tell. But instead I felt an insurmountable desire to sleep, which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"happens to all divers. And my eyes soon closed behind the thick","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"glasses, and I fell into a heavy slumber, which the movement alone had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"prevented before. Captain Nemo and his robust companion, stretched in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the clear crystal, set us the example.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"How long I remained buried in this drowsiness I cannot judge; but, when","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I woke, the sun seemed sinking towards the horizon. Captain Nemo had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"already risen, and I was beginning to stretch my limbs, when an","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"unexpected apparition brought me briskly to my feet.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"A few steps off, a monstrous sea-spider, about thirty-eight inches","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"high, was watching me with squinting eyes, ready to spring upon me.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Though my diver’s dress was thick enough to defend me from the bite of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"this animal, I could not help shuddering with horror. Conseil and the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sailor of the _Nautilus_ awoke at this moment. Captain Nemo pointed out","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the hideous crustacean, which a blow from the butt end of the gun","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"knocked over, and I saw the horrible claws of the monster writhe in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"terrible convulsions. This accident reminded me that other animals more","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to be feared might haunt these obscure depths, against whose attacks my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"diving-dress would not protect me. I had never thought of it before,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"but I now resolved to be upon my guard. Indeed, I thought that this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"halt would mark the termination of our walk; but I was mistaken, for,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"instead of returning to the _Nautilus_, Captain Nemo continued his bold","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"excursion. The ground was still on the incline, its declivity seemed to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"be getting greater, and to be leading us to greater depths. It must","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"have been about three o’clock when we reached a narrow valley, between","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"high perpendicular walls, situated about seventy-five fathoms deep.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Thanks to the perfection of our apparatus, we were forty-five fathoms","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"below the limit which nature seems to have imposed on man as to his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"submarine excursions.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I say seventy-five fathoms, though I had no instrument by which to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"judge the distance. But I knew that even in the clearest waters the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"solar rays could not penetrate further. And accordingly the darkness","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"deepened. At ten paces not an object was visible. I was groping my way,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"when I suddenly saw a brilliant white light. Captain Nemo had just put","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"his electric apparatus into use; his companion did the same, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Conseil and I followed their example. By turning a screw I established","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a communication between the wire and the spiral glass, and the sea, lit","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"by our four lanterns, was illuminated for a circle of thirty-six yards.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo was still plunging into the dark depths of the forest,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"whose trees were getting scarcer at every step. I noticed that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"vegetable life disappeared sooner than animal life. The medusæ had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"already abandoned the arid soil, from which a great number of animals,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"zoophytes, articulata, molluscs, and fishes, still obtained sustenance.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"As we walked I, thought the light of our Ruhmkorff apparatus could not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fail to draw some inhabitant from its dark couch. But if they did","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"approach us, they at least kept at a respectful distance from the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hunters. Several times I saw Captain Nemo stop, put his gun to his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shoulder, and after some moments drop it and walk on. At last, after","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"about four hours, this marvellous excursion came to an end. A wall of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"superb rocks, in an imposing mass, rose before us, a heap of gigantic","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"blocks, an enormous, steep granite shore, forming dark grottos, but","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which presented no practicable slope; it was the prop of the Island of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Crespo. It was the earth! Captain Nemo stopped suddenly. A gesture of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"his brought us all to a halt, and, however desirous I might be to scale","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the wall, I was obliged to stop. Here ended Captain Nemo’s domains. And","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"he would not go beyond them. Further on was a portion of the globe he","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"might not trample upon.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The return began. Captain Nemo had returned to the head of his little","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"band, directing their course without hesitation. I thought we were not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"following the same road to return to the _Nautilus_. The new road was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"very steep, and consequently very painful. We approached the surface of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the sea rapidly. But this return to the upper strata was not so sudden","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"as to cause relief from the pressure too rapidly, which might have","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"produced serious disorder in our organisation, and brought on internal","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"lesions, so fatal to divers. Very soon light reappeared and grew, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the sun being low on the horizon, the refraction edged the different","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"objects with a spectral ring. At ten yards and a half deep, we walked","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"amidst a shoal of little fishes of all kinds, more numerous than the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"birds of the air, and also more agile; but no aquatic game worthy of a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shot had as yet met our gaze, when at that moment I saw the Captain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shoulder his gun quickly, and follow a moving object into the shrubs.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"He fired;—I heard a slight hissing, and a creature fell stunned at some","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"distance from us. It was a magnificent sea-otter, an enhydrus, the only","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"exclusively marine quadruped. This otter was five feet long, and must","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"have been very valuable. Its skin, chestnut-brown above and silvery","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"underneath, would have made one of those beautiful furs so sought after","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in the Russian and Chinese markets; the fineness and the lustre of its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"coat would certainly fetch £80. I admired this curious mammal, with its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rounded head ornamented with short ears, its round eyes, and white","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"whiskers like those of a cat, with webbed feet and nails, and tufted","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"tail. This precious animal, hunted and tracked by fishermen, has now","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"become very rare, and taken refuge chiefly in the northern parts of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Pacific, or probably its race would soon become extinct.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo’s companion took the beast, threw it over his shoulder,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and we continued our journey. For one hour a plain of sand lay","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"stretched before us. Sometimes it rose to within two yards and some","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"inches of the surface of the water. I then saw our image clearly","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"reflected, drawn inversely, and above us appeared an identical group","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"reflecting our movements and our actions; in a word, like us in every","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"point, except that they walked with their heads downward and their feet","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in the air.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Another effect I noticed, which was the passage of thick clouds which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"formed and vanished rapidly; but on reflection I understood that these","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"seeming clouds were due to the varying thickness of the reeds at the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"bottom, and I could even see the fleecy foam which their broken tops","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"multiplied on the water, and the shadows of large birds passing above","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"our heads, whose rapid flight I could discern on the surface of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sea.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"On this occasion, I was witness to one of the finest gun-shots which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ever made the nerves of a hunter thrill. A large bird of great breadth","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of wing, clearly visible, approached, hovering over us. Captain Nemo’s","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"companion shouldered his gun and fired, when it was only a few yards","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"above the waves. The creature fell stunned, and the force of its fall","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"brought it within the reach of dexterous hunter’s grasp. It was an","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"albatross of the finest kind.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Our march had not been interrupted by this incident. For two hours we","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"followed these sandy plains, then fields of algæ very disagreeable to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cross. Candidly, I could do no more when I saw a glimmer of light,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which, for a half mile, broke the darkness of the waters. It was the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"lantern of the _Nautilus_. Before twenty minutes were over we should be","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"on board, and I should be able to breathe with ease, for it seemed that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"my reservoir supplied air very deficient in oxygen. But I did not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"reckon on an accidental meeting, which delayed our arrival for some","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"time.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I had remained some steps behind, when I presently saw Captain Nemo","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"coming hurriedly towards me. With his strong hand he bent me to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ground, his companion doing the same to Conseil. At first I knew not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"what to think of this sudden attack, but I was soon reassured by seeing","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the Captain lie down beside me, and remain immovable.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I was stretched on the ground, just under the shelter of a bush of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"algæ, when, raising my head, I saw some enormous mass, casting","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"phosphorescent gleams, pass blusteringly by.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"My blood froze in my veins as I recognised two formidable sharks which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"threatened us. It was a couple of tintoreas, terrible creatures, with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"enormous tails and a dull glassy stare, the phosphorescent matter","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ejected from holes pierced around the muzzle. Monstrous brutes! which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"would crush a whole man in their iron jaws. I did not know whether","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Conseil stopped to classify them; for my part, I noticed their silver","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"bellies, and their huge mouths bristling with teeth, from a very","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"unscientific point of view, and more as a possible victim than as a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"naturalist.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Happily the voracious creatures do not see well. They passed without","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"seeing us, brushing us with their brownish fins, and we escaped by a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"miracle from a danger certainly greater than meeting a tiger full-face","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in the forest. Half an hour after, guided by the electric light, we","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"reached the _Nautilus_. The outside door had been left open, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo closed it as soon as we had entered the first cell. He","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"then pressed a knob. I heard the pumps working in the midst of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"vessel, I felt the water sinking from around me, and in a few moments","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the cell was entirely empty. The inside door then opened, and we","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"entered the vestry.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"There our diving-dress was taken off, not without some trouble; and,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fairly worn out from want of food and sleep. I returned to my room, in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"great wonder at this surprising excursion at the bottom of the sea.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"CHAPTER XVII","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"FOUR THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE PACIFIC","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The next morning, the 18th of November, I had quite recovered from my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fatigues of the day before, and I went up on to the platform, just as","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the second lieutenant was uttering his daily phrase.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I was admiring the magnificent aspect of the ocean when Captain Nemo","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"appeared. He did not seem to be aware of my presence, and began a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"series of astronomical observations. Then, when he had finished, he","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"went and leant on the cage of the watch-light, and gazed abstractedly","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"on the ocean. In the meantime, a number of the sailors of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_, all strong and healthy men, had come up onto the platform.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"They came to draw up the nets that had been laid all night. These","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sailors were evidently of different nations, although the European type","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was visible in all of them. I recognised some unmistakable Irishmen,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Frenchmen, some Sclaves, and a Greek, or a Candiote. They were civil,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and only used that odd language among themselves, the origin of which I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"could not guess, neither could I question them.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The nets were hauled in. They were a large kind of “chaluts,” like","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"those on the Normandy coasts, great pockets that the waves and a chain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fixed in the smaller meshes kept open. These pockets, drawn by iron","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"poles, swept through the water, and gathered in everything in their","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"way. That day they brought up curious specimens from those productive","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"coasts.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I reckoned that the haul had brought in more than nine hundredweight of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fish. It was a fine haul, but not to be wondered at. Indeed, the nets","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"are let down for several hours, and enclose in their meshes an infinite","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"variety. We had no lack of excellent food, and the rapidity of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_ and the attraction of the electric light could always renew","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"our supply. These several productions of the sea were immediately","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"lowered through the panel to the steward’s room, some to be eaten","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fresh, and others pickled.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The fishing ended, the provision of air renewed, I thought that the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_ was about to continue its submarine excursion, and was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"preparing to return to my room, when, without further preamble, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain turned to me, saying:","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Professor, is not this ocean gifted with real life? It has its tempers","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and its gentle moods. Yesterday it slept as we did, and now it has woke","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"after a quiet night. Look!” he continued, “it wakes under the caresses","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the sun. It is going to renew its diurnal existence. It is an","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"interesting study to watch the play of its organisation. It has a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pulse, arteries, spasms; and I agree with the learned Maury, who","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"discovered in it a circulation as real as the circulation of blood in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"animals.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, the ocean has indeed circulation, and to promote it, the Creator","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"has caused things to multiply in it—caloric, salt, and animalculae.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"When Captain Nemo spoke thus, he seemed altogether changed, and aroused","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"an extraordinary emotion in me.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Also,” he added, “true existence is there; and I can imagine the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"foundations of nautical towns, clusters of submarine houses, which,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"like the _Nautilus_, would ascend every morning to breathe at the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"surface of the water, free towns, independent cities. Yet who knows","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"whether some despot——”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo finished his sentence with a violent gesture. Then,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"addressing me as if to chase away some sorrowful thought:","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“M. Aronnax,” he asked, “do you know the depth of the ocean?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I only know, Captain, what the principal soundings have taught us.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Could you tell me them, so that I can suit them to my purpose?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“These are some,” I replied, “that I remember. If I am not mistaken, a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"depth of 8,000 yards has been found in the North Atlantic, and 2,500","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"yards in the Mediterranean. The most remarkable soundings have been","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"made in the South Atlantic, near the thirty-fifth parallel, and they","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"gave 12,000 yards, 14,000 yards, and 15,000 yards. To sum up all, it is","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"reckoned that if the bottom of the sea were levelled, its mean depth","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"would be about one and three-quarter leagues.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well, Professor,” replied the Captain, “we shall show you better than","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that I hope. As to the mean depth of this part of the Pacific, I tell","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"you it is only 4,000 yards.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Having said this, Captain Nemo went towards the panel, and disappeared","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"down the ladder. I followed him, and went into the large drawing-room.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The screw was immediately put in motion, and the log gave twenty miles","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"an hour.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"During the days and weeks that passed, Captain Nemo was very sparing of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"his visits. I seldom saw him. The lieutenant pricked the ship’s course","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"regularly on the chart, so I could always tell exactly the route of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Nearly every day, for some time, the panels of the drawing-room were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"opened, and we were never tired of penetrating the mysteries of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"submarine world.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The general direction of the _Nautilus_ was south-east, and it kept","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"between 100 and 150 yards of depth. One day, however, I do not know","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"why, being drawn diagonally by means of the inclined planes, it touched","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the bed of the sea. The thermometer indicated a temperature of 4.25","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"(cent.): a temperature that at this depth seemed common to all","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"latitudes.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At three o’clock in the morning of the 26th of November the _Nautilus_","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"crossed the tropic of Cancer at 172° long. On 27th instant it sighted","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the Sandwich Islands, where Cook died, February 14, 1779. We had then","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"gone 4,860 leagues from our starting-point. In the morning, when I went","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"on the platform, I saw two miles to windward, Hawaii, the largest of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the seven islands that form the group. I saw clearly the cultivated","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ranges, and the several mountain-chains that run parallel with the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"side, and the volcanoes that overtop Mouna-Rea, which rise 5,000 yards","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"above the level of the sea. Besides other things the nets brought up,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"were several flabellariae and graceful polypi, that are peculiar to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that part of the ocean. The direction of the _Nautilus_ was still to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the south-east. It crossed the equator December 1, in 142° long.; and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"on the 4th of the same month, after crossing rapidly and without","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"anything in particular occurring, we sighted the Marquesas group. I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"saw, three miles off, Martin’s peak in Nouka-Hiva, the largest of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"group that belongs to France. I only saw the woody mountains against","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the horizon, because Captain Nemo did not wish to bring the ship to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"wind. There the nets brought up beautiful specimens of fish: some with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"azure fins and tails like gold, the flesh of which is unrivalled; some","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"nearly destitute of scales, but of exquisite flavour; others, with bony","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"jaws, and yellow-tinged gills, as good as bonitos; all fish that would","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"be of use to us. After leaving these charming islands protected by the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"French flag, from the 4th to the 11th of December the _Nautilus_ sailed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"over about 2,000 miles.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"During the daytime of the 11th of December I was busy reading in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"large drawing-room. Ned Land and Conseil watched the luminous water","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"through the half-open panels. The _Nautilus_ was immovable. While its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"reservoirs were filled, it kept at a depth of 1,000 yards, a region","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rarely visited in the ocean, and in which large fish were seldom seen.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I was then reading a charming book by Jean Mace, The Slaves of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Stomach, and I was learning some valuable lessons from it, when Conseil","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"interrupted me.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Will master come here a moment?” he said, in a curious voice.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“What is the matter, Conseil?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I want master to look.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I rose, went, and leaned on my elbows before the panes and watched.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"In a full electric light, an enormous black mass, quite immovable, was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"suspended in the midst of the waters. I watched it attentively, seeking","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to find out the nature of this gigantic cetacean. But a sudden thought","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"crossed my mind. “A vessel!” I said, half aloud.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes,” replied the Canadian, “a disabled ship that has sunk","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"perpendicularly.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Ned Land was right; we were close to a vessel of which the tattered","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shrouds still hung from their chains. The keel seemed to be in good","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"order, and it had been wrecked at most some few hours. Three stumps of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"masts, broken off about two feet above the bridge, showed that the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"vessel had had to sacrifice its masts. But, lying on its side, it had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"filled, and it was heeling over to port. This skeleton of what it had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"once been was a sad spectacle as it lay lost under the waves, but","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sadder still was the sight of the bridge, where some corpses, bound","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with ropes, were still lying. I counted five—four men, one of whom was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"standing at the helm, and a woman standing by the poop, holding an","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"infant in her arms. She was quite young. I could distinguish her","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"features, which the water had not decomposed, by the brilliant light","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"from the _Nautilus_. In one despairing effort, she had raised her","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"infant above her head—poor little thing!—whose arms encircled its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"mother’s neck. The attitude of the four sailors was frightful,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"distorted as they were by their convulsive movements, whilst making a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"last effort to free themselves from the cords that bound them to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"vessel. The steersman alone, calm, with a grave, clear face, his grey","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hair glued to his forehead, and his hand clutching the wheel of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"helm, seemed even then to be guiding the three broken masts through the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"depths of the ocean.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"What a scene! We were dumb; our hearts beat fast before this shipwreck,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"taken as it were from life and photographed in its last moments. And I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"saw already, coming towards it with hungry eyes, enormous sharks,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"attracted by the human flesh.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"However, the _Nautilus_, turning, went round the submerged vessel, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in one instant I read on the stern—“The Florida, Sunderland.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"VANIKORO","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"This terrible spectacle was the forerunner of the series of maritime","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"catastrophes that the _Nautilus_ was destined to meet with in its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"route. As long as it went through more frequented waters, we often saw","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the hulls of shipwrecked vessels that were rotting in the depths, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"deeper down cannons, bullets, anchors, chains, and a thousand other","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"iron materials eaten up by rust. However, on the 11th of December we","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sighted the Pomotou Islands, the old “dangerous group” of Bougainville,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that extend over a space of 500 leagues at E.S.E. to W.N.W., from the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Island Ducie to that of Lazareff. This group covers an area of 370","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"square leagues, and it is formed of sixty groups of islands, among","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which the Gambier group is remarkable, over which France exercises","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sway. These are coral islands, slowly raised, but continuous, created","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"by the daily work of polypi. Then this new island will be joined later","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"on to the neighboring groups, and a fifth continent will stretch from","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"New Zealand and New Caledonia, and from thence to the Marquesas.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"One day, when I was suggesting this theory to Captain Nemo, he replied","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"coldly:","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“The earth does not want new continents, but new men.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Chance had conducted the _Nautilus_ towards the Island of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Clermont-Tonnere, one of the most curious of the group, that was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"discovered in 1822 by Captain Bell of the Minerva. I could study now","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the madreporal system, to which are due the islands in this ocean.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Madrepores (which must not be mistaken for corals) have a tissue lined","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with a calcareous crust, and the modifications of its structure have","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"induced M. Milne Edwards, my worthy master, to class them into five","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sections. The animalcule that the marine polypus secretes live by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"millions at the bottom of their cells. Their calcareous deposits become","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rocks, reefs, and large and small islands. Here they form a ring,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"surrounding a little inland lake, that communicates with the sea by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"means of gaps. There they make barriers of reefs like those on the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"coasts of New Caledonia and the various Pomoton islands. In other","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"places, like those at Reunion and at Maurice, they raise fringed reefs,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"high, straight walls, near which the depth of the ocean is","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"considerable.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Some cable-lengths off the shores of the Island of Clermont I admired","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the gigantic work accomplished by these microscopical workers. These","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"walls are specially the work of those madrepores known as milleporas,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"porites, madrepores, and astraeas. These polypi are found particularly","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in the rough beds of the sea, near the surface; and consequently it is","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"from the upper part that they begin their operations, in which they","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"bury themselves by degrees with the debris of the secretions that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"support them. Such is, at least, Darwin’s theory, who thus explains the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"formation of the _atolls_, a superior theory (to my mind) to that given","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the foundation of the madreporical works, summits of mountains or","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"volcanoes, that are submerged some feet below the level of the sea.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I could observe closely these curious walls, for perpendicularly they","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"were more than 300 yards deep, and our electric sheets lighted up this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"calcareous matter brilliantly. Replying to a question Conseil asked me","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"as to the time these colossal barriers took to be raised, I astonished","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"him much by telling him that learned men reckoned it about the eighth","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of an inch in a hundred years.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Towards evening Clermont-Tonnerre was lost in the distance, and the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"route of the _Nautilus_ was sensibly changed. After having crossed the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"tropic of Capricorn in 135° longitude, it sailed W.N.W., making again","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"for the tropical zone. Although the summer sun was very strong, we did","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"not suffer from heat, for at fifteen or twenty fathoms below the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"surface, the temperature did not rise above from ten to twelve degrees.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"On 15th of December, we left to the east the bewitching group of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Societies and the graceful Tahiti, queen of the Pacific. I saw in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"morning, some miles to the windward, the elevated summits of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"island. These waters furnished our table with excellent fish, mackerel,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"bonitos, and some varieties of a sea-serpent.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"On the 25th of December the _Nautilus_ sailed into the midst of the New","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Hebrides, discovered by Quiros in 1606, and that Bougainville explored","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in 1768, and to which Cook gave its present name in 1773. This group is","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"composed principally of nine large islands, that form a band of 120","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"leagues N.N.S. to S.S.W., between 15° and 2° S. lat., and 164 deg. and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"168° long. We passed tolerably near to the Island of Aurou, that at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"noon looked like a mass of green woods, surmounted by a peak of great","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"height.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"That day being Christmas Day, Ned Land seemed to regret sorely the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"non-celebration of “Christmas,” the family fete of which Protestants","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"are so fond. I had not seen Captain Nemo for a week, when, on the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"morning of the 27th, he came into the large drawing-room, always","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"seeming as if he had seen you five minutes before. I was busily tracing","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the route of the _Nautilus_ on the planisphere. The Captain came up to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"me, put his finger on one spot on the chart, and said this single word.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Vanikoro.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The effect was magical! It was the name of the islands on which La","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Perouse had been lost! I rose suddenly.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“The _Nautilus_ has brought us to Vanikoro?” I asked.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, Professor,” said the Captain.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“And I can visit the celebrated islands where the Boussole and the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Astrolabe struck?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“If you like, Professor.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“When shall we be there?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“We are there now.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Followed by Captain Nemo, I went up on to the platform, and greedily","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"scanned the horizon.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"To the N.E. two volcanic islands emerged of unequal size, surrounded by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a coral reef that measured forty miles in circumference. We were close","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to Vanikoro, really the one to which Dumont d’Urville gave the name of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Isle de la Recherche, and exactly facing the little harbour of Vanou,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"situated in 16° 4′ S. lat., and 164° 32′ E. long. The earth seemed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"covered with verdure from the shore to the summits in the interior,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that were crowned by Mount Kapogo, 476 feet high. The _Nautilus_,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"having passed the outer belt of rocks by a narrow strait, found itself","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"among breakers where the sea was from thirty to forty fathoms deep.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Under the verdant shade of some mangroves I perceived some savages, who","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"appeared greatly surprised at our approach. In the long black body,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"moving between wind and water, did they not see some formidable","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cetacean that they regarded with suspicion?","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Just then Captain Nemo asked me what I knew about the wreck of La","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Perouse.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Only what everyone knows, Captain,” I replied.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“And could you tell me what everyone knows about it?” he inquired,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ironically.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Easily.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I related to him all that the last works of Dumont d’Urville had made","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"known—works from which the following is a brief account.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"La Perouse, and his second, Captain de Langle, were sent by Louis XVI,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in 1785, on a voyage of circumnavigation. They embarked in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"corvettes Boussole and the Astrolabe, neither of which were again heard","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of. In 1791, the French Government, justly uneasy as to the fate of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"these two sloops, manned two large merchantmen, the Recherche and the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Esperance, which left Brest the 28th of September under the command of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Bruni d’Entrecasteaux.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Two months after, they learned from Bowen, commander of the Albemarle,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that the debris of shipwrecked vessels had been seen on the coasts of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"New Georgia. But D’Entrecasteaux, ignoring this communication—rather","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"uncertain, besides—directed his course towards the Admiralty Islands,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"mentioned in a report of Captain Hunter’s as being the place where La","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Perouse was wrecked.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"They sought in vain. The Esperance and the Recherche passed before","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Vanikoro without stopping there, and, in fact, this voyage was most","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"disastrous, as it cost D’Entrecasteaux his life, and those of two of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"his lieutenants, besides several of his crew.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Dillon, a shrewd old Pacific sailor, was the first to find","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"unmistakable traces of the wrecks. On the 15th of May, 1824, his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"vessel, the St. Patrick, passed close to Tikopia, one of the New","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Hebrides. There a Lascar came alongside in a canoe, sold him the handle","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of a sword in silver that bore the print of characters engraved on the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hilt. The Lascar pretended that six years before, during a stay at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Vanikoro, he had seen two Europeans that belonged to some vessels that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"had run aground on the reefs some years ago.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Dillon guessed that he meant La Perouse, whose disappearance had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"troubled the whole world. He tried to get on to Vanikoro, where,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"according to the Lascar, he would find numerous debris of the wreck,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"but winds and tides prevented him.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Dillon returned to Calcutta. There he interested the Asiatic Society","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and the Indian Company in his discovery. A vessel, to which was given","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the name of the Recherche, was put at his disposal, and he set out,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"23rd January, 1827, accompanied by a French agent.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The Recherche, after touching at several points in the Pacific, cast","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"anchor before Vanikoro, 7th July, 1827, in that same harbour of Vanou","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"where the _Nautilus_ was at this time.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"There it collected numerous relics of the wreck—iron utensils, anchors,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pulley-strops, swivel-guns, an 18 lbs. shot, fragments of astronomical","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"instruments, a piece of crown work, and a bronze clock, bearing this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"inscription—“Bazin m’a fait,” the mark of the foundry of the arsenal at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Brest about 1785. There could be no further doubt.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Dillon, having made all inquiries, stayed in the unlucky place till","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"October. Then he quitted Vanikoro, and directed his course towards New","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Zealand; put into Calcutta, 7th April, 1828, and returned to France,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"where he was warmly welcomed by Charles X.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"But at the same time, without knowing Dillon’s movements, Dumont","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"d’Urville had already set out to find the scene of the wreck. And they","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"had learned from a whaler that some medals and a cross of St. Louis had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"been found in the hands of some savages of Louisiade and New Caledonia.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Dumont d’Urville, commander of the Astrolabe, had then sailed, and two","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"months after Dillon had left Vanikoro he put into Hobart Town. There he","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"learned the results of Dillon’s inquiries, and found that a certain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"James Hobbs, second lieutenant of the Union of Calcutta, after landing","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"on an island situated 8° 18′ S. lat., and 156° 30′ E. long., had seen","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"some iron bars and red stuffs used by the natives of these parts.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Dumont d’Urville, much perplexed, and not knowing how to credit the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"reports of low-class journals, decided to follow Dillon’s track.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"On the 10th of February, 1828, the Astrolabe appeared off Tikopia, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"took as guide and interpreter a deserter found on the island; made his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"way to Vanikoro, sighted it on the 12th inst., lay among the reefs","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"until the 14th, and not until the 20th did he cast anchor within the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"barrier in the harbour of Vanou.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"On the 23rd, several officers went round the island and brought back","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"some unimportant trifles. The natives, adopting a system of denials and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"evasions, refused to take them to the unlucky place. This ambiguous","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"conduct led them to believe that the natives had ill-treated the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"castaways, and indeed they seemed to fear that Dumont d’Urville had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"come to avenge La Perouse and his unfortunate crew.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"However, on the 26th, appeased by some presents, and understanding that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"they had no reprisals to fear, they led M. Jacquireot to the scene of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the wreck.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"There, in three or four fathoms of water, between the reefs of Pacou","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and Vanou, lay anchors, cannons, pigs of lead and iron, embedded in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"limy concretions. The large boat and the whaler belonging to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Astrolabe were sent to this place, and, not without some difficulty,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"their crews hauled up an anchor weighing 1,800 lbs., a brass gun, some","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pigs of iron, and two copper swivel-guns.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Dumont d’Urville, questioning the natives, learned too that La Perouse,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"after losing both his vessels on the reefs of this island, had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"constructed a smaller boat, only to be lost a second time. Where, no","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"one knew.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"But the French Government, fearing that Dumont d’Urville was not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"acquainted with Dillon’s movements, had sent the sloop Bayonnaise,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"commanded by Legoarant de Tromelin, to Vanikoro, which had been","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"stationed on the west coast of America. The Bayonnaise cast her anchor","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"before Vanikoro some months after the departure of the Astrolabe, but","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"found no new document; but stated that the savages had respected the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"monument to La Perouse. That is the substance of what I told Captain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Nemo.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“So,” he said, “no one knows now where the third vessel perished that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was constructed by the castaways on the island of Vanikoro?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“No one knows.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo said nothing, but signed to me to follow him into the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"large saloon. The _Nautilus_ sank several yards below the waves, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the panels were opened.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I hastened to the aperture, and under the crustations of coral, covered","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with fungi, syphonules, alcyons, madrepores, through myriads of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"charming fish—girelles, glyphisidri, pompherides, diacopes, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"holocentres—I recognised certain debris that the drags had not been","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"able to tear up—iron stirrups, anchors, cannons, bullets, capstan","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fittings, the stem of a ship, all objects clearly proving the wreck of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"some vessel, and now carpeted with living flowers. While I was looking","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"on this desolate scene, Captain Nemo said, in a sad voice:","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Commander La Perouse set out 7th December, 1785, with his vessels La","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Boussole and the Astrolabe. He first cast anchor at Botany Bay, visited","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the Friendly Isles, New Caledonia, then directed his course towards","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Santa Cruz, and put into Namouka, one of the Hapai group. Then his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"vessels struck on the unknown reefs of Vanikoro. The Boussole, which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"went first, ran aground on the southerly coast. The Astrolabe went to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"its help, and ran aground too. The first vessel was destroyed almost","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"immediately. The second, stranded under the wind, resisted some days.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The natives made the castaways welcome. They installed themselves in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the island, and constructed a smaller boat with the debris of the two","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"large ones. Some sailors stayed willingly at Vanikoro; the others, weak","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and ill, set out with La Perouse. They directed their course towards","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the Solomon Islands, and there perished, with everything, on the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"westerly coast of the chief island of the group, between Capes","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Deception and Satisfaction.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“How do you know that?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“By this, that I found on the spot where was the last wreck.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo showed me a tin-plate box, stamped with the French arms,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and corroded by the salt water. He opened it, and I saw a bundle of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"papers, yellow but still readable.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"They were the instructions of the naval minister to Commander La","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Perouse, annotated in the margin in Louis XVI’s handwriting.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Ah! it is a fine death for a sailor!” said Captain Nemo, at last. “A","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"coral tomb makes a quiet grave; and I trust that I and my comrades will","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"find no other.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"During the night of the 27th or 28th of December, the _Nautilus_ left","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the shores of Vanikoro with great speed. Her course was south-westerly,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and in three days she had gone over the 750 leagues that separated it","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"Early on the 1st of January, 1863, Conseil joined me on the platform.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Master, will you permit me to wish you a happy New Year?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“What! Conseil; exactly as if I was at Paris in my study at the Jardin","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"des Plantes? Well, I accept your good wishes, and thank you for them.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Only, I will ask you what you mean by a ‘Happy New Year’ under our","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"circumstances? Do you mean the year that will bring us to the end of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"our imprisonment, or the year that sees us continue this strange","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"voyage?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Really, I do not know how to answer, master. We are sure to see","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"curious things, and for the last two months we have not had time for","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"dullness. The last marvel is always the most astonishing; and, if we","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"continue this progression, I do not know how it will end. It is my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"opinion that we shall never again see the like. I think then, with no","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"offence to master, that a happy year would be one in which we could see","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"everything.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"On 2nd January we had made 11,340 miles, or 5,250 French leagues, since","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"our starting-point in the Japan Seas. Before the ship’s head stretched","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the dangerous shores of the coral sea, on the north-east coast of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"which Cook’s vessel was lost, 10th June, 1770. The boat in which Cook","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was struck on a rock, and, if it did not sink, it was owing to a piece","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of coral that was broken by the shock, and fixed itself in the broken","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"keel.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I had wished to visit the reef, 360 leagues long, against which the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sea, always rough, broke with great violence, with a noise like","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"thunder. But just then the inclined planes drew the _Nautilus_ down to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a great depth, and I could see nothing of the high coral walls. I had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to content myself with the different specimens of fish brought up by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the nets. I remarked, among others, some germons, a species of mackerel","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"as large as a tunny, with bluish sides, and striped with transverse","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"bands, that disappear with the animal’s life.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"These fish followed us in shoals, and furnished us with very delicate","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"food. We took also a large number of gilt-heads, about one and a half","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"inches long, tasting like dorys; and flying pyrapeds like submarine","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"swallows, which, in dark nights, light alternately the air and water","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with their phosphorescent light. Among the molluscs and zoophytes, I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"found in the meshes of the net several species of alcyonarians, echini,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hammers, spurs, dials, cerites, and hyalleae. The flora was represented","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"by beautiful floating seaweeds, laminariae, and macrocystes,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"impregnated with the mucilage that transudes through their pores; and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"among which I gathered an admirable Nemastoma Geliniarois, that was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"classed among the natural curiosities of the museum.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Two days after crossing the coral sea, 4th January, we sighted the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Papuan coasts. On this occasion, Captain Nemo informed me that his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"intention was to get into the Indian Ocean by the Strait of Torres. His","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"communication ended there.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The Torres Straits are nearly thirty-four leagues wide; but they are","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"obstructed by an innumerable quantity of islands, islets, breakers, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rocks, that make its navigation almost impracticable; so that Captain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Nemo took all needful precautions to cross them. The _Nautilus_,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"floating betwixt wind and water, went at a moderate pace. Her screw,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"like a cetacean’s tail, beat the waves slowly.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Profiting by this, I and my two companions went up on to the deserted","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"platform. Before us was the steersman’s cage, and I expected that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo was there directing the course of the _Nautilus_. I had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"before me the excellent charts of the Straits of Torres, and I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"consulted them attentively. Round the _Nautilus_ the sea dashed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"furiously. The course of the waves, that went from south-east to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"north-west at the rate of two and a half miles, broke on the coral that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"showed itself here and there.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“This is a bad sea!” remarked Ned Land.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Detestable indeed, and one that does not suit a boat like the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“The Captain must be very sure of his route, for I see there pieces of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"coral that would do for its keel if it only touched them slightly.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Indeed the situation was dangerous, but the _Nautilus_ seemed to slide","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"like magic off these rocks. It did not follow the routes of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Astrolabe and the Zelee exactly, for they proved fatal to Dumont","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"d’Urville. It bore more northwards, coasted the Islands of Murray, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"came back to the south-west towards Cumberland Passage. I thought it","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was going to pass it by, when, going back to north-west, it went","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"through a large quantity of islands and islets little known, towards","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the Island Sound and Canal Mauvais.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I wondered if Captain Nemo, foolishly imprudent, would steer his vessel","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"into that pass where Dumont d’Urville’s two corvettes touched; when,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"swerving again, and cutting straight through to the west, he steered","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"for the Island of Gilboa.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"It was then three in the afternoon. The tide began to recede, being","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"quite full. The _Nautilus_ approached the island, that I still saw,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with its remarkable border of screw-pines. He stood off it at about two","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"miles distant. Suddenly a shock overthrew me. The _Nautilus_ just","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"touched a rock, and stayed immovable, laying lightly to port side.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"When I rose, I perceived Captain Nemo and his lieutenant on the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"platform. They were examining the situation of the vessel, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"exchanging words in their incomprehensible dialect.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"She was situated thus: Two miles, on the starboard side, appeared","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Gilboa, stretching from north to west like an immense arm. Towards the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"south and east some coral showed itself, left by the ebb. We had run","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"aground, and in one of those seas where the tides are middling—a sorry","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"matter for the floating of the _Nautilus_. However, the vessel had not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"suffered, for her keel was solidly joined. But, if she could neither","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"glide off nor move, she ran the risk of being for ever fastened to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"these rocks, and then Captain Nemo’s submarine vessel would be done","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"for.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I was reflecting thus, when the Captain, cool and calm, always master","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of himself, approached me.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“An accident?” I asked.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“No; an incident.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But an incident that will oblige you perhaps to become an inhabitant","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of this land from which you flee?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo looked at me curiously, and made a negative gesture, as","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"much as to say that nothing would force him to set foot on terra firma","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"again. Then he said:","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Besides, M. Aronnax, the _Nautilus_ is not lost; it will carry you yet","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"into the midst of the marvels of the ocean. Our voyage is only begun,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and I do not wish to be deprived so soon of the honour of your","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"company.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“However, Captain Nemo,” I replied, without noticing the ironical turn","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of his phrase, “the _Nautilus_ ran aground in open sea. Now the tides","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"are not strong in the Pacific; and, if you cannot lighten the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_, I do not see how it will be reinflated.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“The tides are not strong in the Pacific: you are right there,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Professor; but in Torres Straits one finds still a difference of a yard","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and a half between the level of high and low seas. To-day is 4th","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"January, and in five days the moon will be full. Now, I shall be very","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"much astonished if that satellite does not raise these masses of water","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sufficiently, and render me a service that I should be indebted to her","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"for.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Having said this, Captain Nemo, followed by his lieutenant, redescended","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to the interior of the _Nautilus_. As to the vessel, it moved not, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was immovable, as if the coralline polypi had already walled it up with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"their in destructible cement.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well, sir?” said Ned Land, who came up to me after the departure of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the Captain.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well, friend Ned, we will wait patiently for the tide on the 9th","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"instant; for it appears that the moon will have the goodness to put it","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"off again.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Really?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Really.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“And this Captain is not going to cast anchor at all since the tide","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"will suffice?” said Conseil, simply.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The Canadian looked at Conseil, then shrugged his shoulders.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Sir, you may believe me when I tell you that this piece of iron will","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"navigate neither on nor under the sea again; it is only fit to be sold","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"for its weight. I think, therefore, that the time has come to part","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"company with Captain Nemo.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Friend Ned, I do not despair of this stout _Nautilus_, as you do; and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in four days we shall know what to hold to on the Pacific tides.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Besides, flight might be possible if we were in sight of the English or","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Provencal coast; but on the Papuan shores, it is another thing; and it","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"will be time enough to come to that extremity if the _Nautilus_ does","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"not recover itself again, which I look upon as a grave event.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But do they know, at least, how to act circumspectly? There is an","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"island; on that island there are trees; under those trees, terrestrial","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"animals, bearers of cutlets and roast beef, to which I would willingly","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"give a trial.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“In this, friend Ned is right,” said Conseil, “and I agree with him.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Could not master obtain permission from his friend Captain Nemo to put","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"us on land, if only so as not to lose the habit of treading on the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"solid parts of our planet?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I can ask him, but he will refuse.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Will master risk it?” asked Conseil, “and we shall know how to rely","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"upon the Captain’s amiability.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"To my great surprise, Captain Nemo gave me the permission I asked for,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and he gave it very agreeably, without even exacting from me a promise","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to return to the vessel; but flight across New Guinea might be very","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"perilous, and I should not have counselled Ned Land to attempt it.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Better to be a prisoner on board the _Nautilus_ than to fall into the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hands of the natives.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At eight o’clock, armed with guns and hatchets, we got off the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_. The sea was pretty calm; a slight breeze blew on land.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Conseil and I rowing, we sped along quickly, and Ned steered in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"straight passage that the breakers left between them. The boat was well","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"handled, and moved rapidly.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Ned Land could not restrain his joy. He was like a prisoner that had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"escaped from prison, and knew not that it was necessary to re-enter it.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Meat! We are going to eat some meat; and what meat!” he replied. “Real","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"game! no, bread, indeed.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I do not say that fish is not good; we must not abuse it; but a piece","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of fresh venison, grilled on live coals, will agreeably vary our","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ordinary course.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Glutton!” said Conseil, “he makes my mouth water.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“It remains to be seen,” I said, “if these forests are full of game,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and if the game is not such as will hunt the hunter himself.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well said, M. Aronnax,” replied the Canadian, whose teeth seemed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sharpened like the edge of a hatchet; “but I will eat tiger—loin of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"tiger—if there is no other quadruped on this island.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Friend Ned is uneasy about it,” said Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Whatever it may be,” continued Ned Land, “every animal with four paws","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"without feathers, or with two paws without feathers, will be saluted by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"my first shot.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Very well! Master Land’s imprudences are beginning.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Never fear, M. Aronnax,” replied the Canadian; “I do not want","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"twenty-five minutes to offer you a dish, of my sort.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At half-past eight the _Nautilus_ boat ran softly aground on a heavy","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sand, after having happily passed the coral reef that surrounds the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Island of Gilboa.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"CHAPTER XX","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"A FEW DAYS ON LAND","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I was much impressed on touching land. Ned Land tried the soil with his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"feet, as if to take possession of it. However, it was only two months","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"before that we had become, according to Captain Nemo, “passengers on","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"board the _Nautilus_,” but, in reality, prisoners of its commander.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"In a few minutes we were within musket-shot of the coast. The whole","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"horizon was hidden behind a beautiful curtain of forests. Enormous","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"trees, the trunks of which attained a height of 200 feet, were tied to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"each other by garlands of bindweed, real natural hammocks, which a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"light breeze rocked. They were mimosas, figs, hibisci, and palm trees,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"mingled together in profusion; and under the shelter of their verdant","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"vault grew orchids, leguminous plants, and ferns.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"But, without noticing all these beautiful specimens of Papuan flora,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the Canadian abandoned the agreeable for the useful. He discovered a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"coco-tree, beat down some of the fruit, broke them, and we drunk the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"milk and ate the nut with a satisfaction that protested against the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ordinary food on the _Nautilus_.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Excellent!” said Ned Land.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Exquisite!” replied Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“And I do not think,” said the Canadian, “that he would object to our","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"introducing a cargo of coco-nuts on board.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I do not think he would, but he would not taste them.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“So much the worse for him,” said Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“And so much the better for us,” replied Ned Land. “There will be more","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"for us.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“One word only, Master Land,” I said to the harpooner, who was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"beginning to ravage another coco-nut tree. “Coco-nuts are good things,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"but before filling the canoe with them it would be wise to reconnoitre","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and see if the island does not produce some substance not less useful.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Fresh vegetables would be welcome on board the _Nautilus_.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Master is right,” replied Conseil; “and I propose to reserve three","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"places in our vessel, one for fruits, the other for vegetables, and the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"third for the venison, of which I have not yet seen the smallest","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"specimen.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Conseil, we must not despair,” said the Canadian.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Let us continue,” I returned, “and lie in wait. Although the island","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"seems uninhabited, it might still contain some individuals that would","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"be less hard than we on the nature of game.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Ho! ho!” said Ned Land, moving his jaws significantly.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well, Ned!” said Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“My word!” returned the Canadian, “I begin to understand the charms of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"anthropophagy.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Ned! Ned! what are you saying? You, a man-eater? I should not feel","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"safe with you, especially as I share your cabin. I might perhaps wake","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"one day to find myself half devoured.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Friend Conseil, I like you much, but not enough to eat you","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"unnecessarily.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I would not trust you,” replied Conseil. “But enough. We must","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"absolutely bring down some game to satisfy this cannibal, or else one","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of these fine mornings, master will find only pieces of his servant to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"serve him.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"While we were talking thus, we were penetrating the sombre arches of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the forest, and for two hours we surveyed it in all directions.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Chance rewarded our search for eatable vegetables, and one of the most","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"useful products of the tropical zones furnished us with precious food","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that we missed on board. I would speak of the bread-fruit tree, very","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"abundant in the island of Gilboa; and I remarked chiefly the variety","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"destitute of seeds, which bears in Malaya the name of “rima.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Ned Land knew these fruits well. He had already eaten many during his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"numerous voyages, and he knew how to prepare the eatable substance.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Moreover, the sight of them excited him, and he could contain himself","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"no longer.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Master,” he said, “I shall die if I do not taste a little of this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"bread-fruit pie.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Taste it, friend Ned—taste it as you want. We are here to make","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"experiments—make them.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“It won’t take long,” said the Canadian.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"And, provided with a lentil, he lighted a fire of dead wood that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"crackled joyously. During this time, Conseil and I chose the best","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fruits of the bread-fruit. Some had not then attained a sufficient","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"degree of maturity; and their thick skin covered a white but rather","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fibrous pulp. Others, the greater number yellow and gelatinous, waited","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"only to be picked.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"These fruits enclosed no kernel. Conseil brought a dozen to Ned Land,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"who placed them on a coal fire, after having cut them in thick slices,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and while doing this repeating:","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“You will see, master, how good this bread is. More so when one has","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"been deprived of it so long. It is not even bread,” added he, “but a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"delicate pastry. You have eaten none, master?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“No, Ned.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Very well, prepare yourself for a juicy thing. If you do not come for","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"more, I am no longer the king of harpooners.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"After some minutes, the part of the fruits that was exposed to the fire","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was completely roasted. The interior looked like a white pasty, a sort","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of soft crumb, the flavour of which was like that of an artichoke.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"It must be confessed this bread was excellent, and I ate of it with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"great relish.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“What time is it now?” asked the Canadian.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Two o’clock at least,” replied Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“How time flies on firm ground!” sighed Ned Land.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Let us be off,” replied Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"We returned through the forest, and completed our collection by a raid","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"upon the cabbage-palms, that we gathered from the tops of the trees,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"little beans that I recognised as the “abrou” of the Malays, and yams","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of a superior quality.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"We were loaded when we reached the boat. But Ned Land did not find his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"provisions sufficient. Fate, however, favoured us. Just as we were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pushing off, he perceived several trees, from twenty-five to thirty","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"feet high, a species of palm-tree.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At last, at five o’clock in the evening, loaded with our riches, we","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"quitted the shore, and half an hour after we hailed the _Nautilus_. No","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"one appeared on our arrival. The enormous iron-plated cylinder seemed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"deserted. The provisions embarked, I descended to my chamber, and after","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"supper slept soundly.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The next day, 6th January, nothing new on board. Not a sound inside,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"not a sign of life. The boat rested along the edge, in the same place","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in which we had left it. We resolved to return to the island. Ned Land","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hoped to be more fortunate than on the day before with regard to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hunt, and wished to visit another part of the forest.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At dawn we set off. The boat, carried on by the waves that flowed to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shore, reached the island in a few minutes.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"We landed, and, thinking that it was better to give in to the Canadian,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"we followed Ned Land, whose long limbs threatened to distance us. He","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"wound up the coast towards the west: then, fording some torrents, he","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"gained the high plain that was bordered with admirable forests. Some","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"kingfishers were rambling along the water-courses, but they would not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"let themselves be approached. Their circumspection proved to me that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"these birds knew what to expect from bipeds of our species, and I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"concluded that, if the island was not inhabited, at least human beings","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"occasionally frequented it.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"After crossing a rather large prairie, we arrived at the skirts of a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"little wood that was enlivened by the songs and flight of a large","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"number of birds.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“There are only birds,” said Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But they are eatable,” replied the harpooner.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I do not agree with you, friend Ned, for I see only parrots there.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Friend Conseil,” said Ned, gravely, “the parrot is like pheasant to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"those who have nothing else.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“And,” I added, “this bird, suitably prepared, is worth knife and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fork.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Indeed, under the thick foliage of this wood, a world of parrots were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"flying from branch to branch, only needing a careful education to speak","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the human language. For the moment, they were chattering with parrots","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of all colours, and grave cockatoos, who seemed to meditate upon some","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"philosophical problem, whilst brilliant red lories passed like a piece","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of bunting carried away by the breeze, papuans, with the finest azure","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"colours, and in all a variety of winged things most charming to behold,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"but few eatable.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"However, a bird peculiar to these lands, and which has never passed the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"limits of the Arrow and Papuan islands, was wanting in this collection.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"But fortune reserved it for me before long.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"After passing through a moderately thick copse, we found a plain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"obstructed with bushes. I saw then those magnificent birds, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"disposition of whose long feathers obliges them to fly against the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"wind. Their undulating flight, graceful aerial curves, and the shading","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of their colours, attracted and charmed one’s looks. I had no trouble","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in recognising them.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Birds of paradise!” I exclaimed.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The Malays, who carry on a great trade in these birds with the Chinese,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"have several means that we could not employ for taking them. Sometimes","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"they put snares on the top of high trees that the birds of paradise","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"prefer to frequent. Sometimes they catch them with a viscous birdlime","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that paralyses their movements. They even go so far as to poison the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fountains that the birds generally drink from. But we were obliged to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fire at them during flight, which gave us few chances to bring them","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"down; and, indeed, we vainly exhausted one half our ammunition.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"About eleven o’clock in the morning, the first range of mountains that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"form the centre of the island was traversed, and we had killed nothing.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Hunger drove us on. The hunters had relied on the products of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"chase, and they were wrong. Happily Conseil, to his great surprise,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"made a double shot and secured breakfast. He brought down a white","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pigeon and a wood-pigeon, which, cleverly plucked and suspended from a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"skewer, was roasted before a red fire of dead wood. While these","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"interesting birds were cooking, Ned prepared the fruit of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"bread-tree. Then the wood-pigeons were devoured to the bones, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"declared excellent. The nutmeg, with which they are in the habit of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"stuffing their crops, flavours their flesh and renders it delicious","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"eating.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Now, Ned, what do you miss now?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Some four-footed game, M. Aronnax. All these pigeons are only","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"side-dishes and trifles; and until I have killed an animal with cutlets","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I shall not be content.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Nor I, Ned, if I do not catch a bird of paradise.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Let us continue hunting,” replied Conseil. “Let us go towards the sea.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"We have arrived at the first declivities of the mountains, and I think","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"we had better regain the region of forests.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"That was sensible advice, and was followed out. After walking for one","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hour we had attained a forest of sago-trees. Some inoffensive serpents","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"glided away from us. The birds of paradise fled at our approach, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"truly I despaired of getting near one when Conseil, who was walking in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"front, suddenly bent down, uttered a triumphal cry, and came back to me","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"bringing a magnificent specimen.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Ah! bravo, Conseil!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Master is very good.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“No, my boy; you have made an excellent stroke. Take one of these","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"living birds, and carry it in your hand.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“If master will examine it, he will see that I have not deserved great","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"merit.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Why, Conseil?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Because this bird is as drunk as a quail.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Drunk!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, sir; drunk with the nutmegs that it devoured under the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"nutmeg-tree, under which I found it. See, friend Ned, see the monstrous","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"effects of intemperance!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“By Jove!” exclaimed the Canadian, “because I have drunk gin for two","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"months, you must needs reproach me!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"However, I examined the curious bird. Conseil was right. The bird,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"drunk with the juice, was quite powerless. It could not fly; it could","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hardly walk.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"This bird belonged to the most beautiful of the eight species that are","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"found in Papua and in the neighbouring islands. It was the “large","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"emerald bird, the most rare kind.” It measured three feet in length.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Its head was comparatively small, its eyes placed near the opening of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the beak, and also small. But the shades of colour were beautiful,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"having a yellow beak, brown feet and claws, nut-coloured wings with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"purple tips, pale yellow at the back of the neck and head, and emerald","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"colour at the throat, chestnut on the breast and belly. Two horned,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"downy nets rose from below the tail, that prolonged the long light","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"feathers of admirable fineness, and they completed the whole of this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"marvellous bird, that the natives have poetically named the “bird of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the sun.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"But if my wishes were satisfied by the possession of the bird of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"paradise, the Canadian’s were not yet. Happily, about two o’clock, Ned","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Land brought down a magnificent hog; from the brood of those the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"natives call “bari-outang.” The animal came in time for us to procure","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"real quadruped meat, and he was well received. Ned Land was very proud","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of his shot. The hog, hit by the electric ball, fell stone dead. The","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Canadian skinned and cleaned it properly, after having taken half a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"dozen cutlets, destined to furnish us with a grilled repast in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"evening. Then the hunt was resumed, which was still more marked by Ned","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and Conseil’s exploits.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Indeed, the two friends, beating the bushes, roused a herd of kangaroos","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that fled and bounded along on their elastic paws. But these animals","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"did not take to flight so rapidly but what the electric capsule could","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"stop their course.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Ah, Professor!” cried Ned Land, who was carried away by the delights","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the chase, “what excellent game, and stewed, too! What a supply for","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the _Nautilus!_ Two! three! five down! And to think that we shall eat","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that flesh, and that the idiots on board shall not have a crumb!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I think that, in the excess of his joy, the Canadian, if he had not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"talked so much, would have killed them all. But he contented himself","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with a single dozen of these interesting marsupians. These animals were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"small. They were a species of those “kangaroo rabbitss” that live","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"habitually in the hollows of trees, and whose speed is extreme; but","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"they are moderately fat, and furnish, at least, estimable food. We were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"very satisfied with the results of the hunt. Happy Ned proposed to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"return to this enchanting island the next day, for he wished to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"depopulate it of all the eatable quadrupeds. But he had reckoned","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"without his host.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At six o’clock in the evening we had regained the shore; our boat was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"moored to the usual place. The _Nautilus_, like a long rock, emerged","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"from the waves two miles from the beach. Ned Land, without waiting,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"occupied himself about the important dinner business. He understood all","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"about cooking well. The “bari-outang,” grilled on the coals, soon","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"scented the air with a delicious odour.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Indeed, the dinner was excellent. Two wood-pigeons completed this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"extraordinary menu. The sago pasty, the artocarpus bread, some mangoes,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"half a dozen pineapples, and the liquor fermented from some coco-nuts,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"overjoyed us. I even think that my worthy companions’ ideas had not all","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the plainness desirable.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Suppose we do not return to the _Nautilus_ this evening?” said","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Suppose we never return?” added Ned Land.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Just then a stone fell at our feet and cut short the harpooner’s","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"proposition.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"CHAPTER XXI","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"CAPTAIN NEMO’S THUNDERBOLT","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"We looked at the edge of the forest without rising, my hand stopping in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the action of putting it to my mouth, Ned Land’s completing its office.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Stones do not fall from the sky,” remarked Conseil, “or they would","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"merit the name aerolites.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"A second stone, carefully aimed, that made a savoury pigeon’s leg fall","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"from Conseil’s hand, gave still more weight to his observation. We all","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"three arose, shouldered our guns, and were ready to reply to any","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"attack.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Are they apes?” cried Ned Land.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Very nearly—they are savages.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“To the boat!” I said, hurrying to the sea.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"It was indeed necessary to beat a retreat, for about twenty natives","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"armed with bows and slings appeared on the skirts of a copse that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"masked the horizon to the right, hardly a hundred steps from us.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Our boat was moored about sixty feet from us. The savages approached","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"us, not running, but making hostile demonstrations. Stones and arrows","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fell thickly.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Ned Land had not wished to leave his provisions; and, in spite of his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"imminent danger, his pig on one side and kangaroos on the other, he","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"went tolerably fast. In two minutes we were on the shore. To load the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"boat with provisions and arms, to push it out to sea, and ship the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"oars, was the work of an instant. We had not gone two cable-lengths,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"when a hundred savages, howling and gesticulating, entered the water up","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to their waists. I watched to see if their apparition would attract","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"some men from the _Nautilus_ on to the platform. But no. The enormous","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"machine, lying off, was absolutely deserted.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Twenty minutes later we were on board. The panels were open. After","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"making the boat fast, we entered into the interior of the _Nautilus_.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I descended to the drawing-room, from whence I heard some chords.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo was there, bending over his organ, and plunged in a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"musical ecstasy.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Captain!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"He did not hear me.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Captain!” I said, touching his hand.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"He shuddered, and, turning round, said, “Ah! it is you, Professor?","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Well, have you had a good hunt, have you botanised successfully?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes Captain; but we have unfortunately brought a troop of bipeds,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"whose vicinity troubles me.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“What bipeds?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Savages.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Savages!” he echoed, ironically. “So you are astonished, Professor, at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"having set foot on a strange land and finding savages? Savages! where","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"are there not any? Besides, are they worse than others, these whom you","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"call savages?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But Captain——”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“How many have you counted?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“A hundred at least.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“M. Aronnax,” replied Captain Nemo, placing his fingers on the organ","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"stops, “when all the natives of Papua are assembled on this shore, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_ will have nothing to fear from their attacks.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The Captain’s fingers were then running over the keys of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"instrument, and I remarked that he touched only the black keys, which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"gave his melodies an essentially Scotch character. Soon he had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"forgotten my presence, and had plunged into a reverie that I did not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"disturb. I went up again on to the platform: night had already fallen;","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"for, in this low latitude, the sun sets rapidly and without twilight. I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"could only see the island indistinctly; but the numerous fires, lighted","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"on the beach, showed that the natives did not think of leaving it. I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was alone for several hours, sometimes thinking of the natives—but","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"without any dread of them, for the imperturbable confidence of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain was catching—sometimes forgetting them to admire the splendours","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the night in the tropics. My remembrances went to France in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"train of those zodiacal stars that would shine in some hours’ time. The","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"moon shone in the midst of the constellations of the zenith.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The night slipped away without any mischance, the islanders frightened","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"no doubt at the sight of a monster aground in the bay. The panels were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"open, and would have offered an easy access to the interior of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At six o’clock in the morning of the 8th January I went up on to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"platform. The dawn was breaking. The island soon showed itself through","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the dissipating fogs, first the shore, then the summits.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The natives were there, more numerous than on the day before—five or","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"six hundred perhaps—some of them, profiting by the low water, had come","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"on to the coral, at less than two cable-lengths from the _Nautilus_. I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"distinguished them easily; they were true Papuans, with athletic","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"figures, men of good race, large high foreheads, large, but not broad","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and flat, and white teeth. Their woolly hair, with a reddish tinge,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"showed off on their black shining bodies like those of the Nubians.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"From the lobes of their ears, cut and distended, hung chaplets of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"bones. Most of these savages were naked. Amongst them, I remarked some","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"women, dressed from the hips to knees in quite a crinoline of herbs,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that sustained a vegetable waistband. Some chiefs had ornamented their","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"necks with a crescent and collars of glass beads, red and white; nearly","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"all were armed with bows, arrows, and shields and carried on their","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shoulders a sort of net containing those round stones which they cast","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"from their slings with great skill. One of these chiefs, rather near to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the _Nautilus_, examined it attentively. He was, perhaps, a “mado” of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"high rank, for he was draped in a mat of banana-leaves, notched round","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the edges, and set off with brilliant colours.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I could easily have knocked down this native, who was within a short","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"length; but I thought that it was better to wait for real hostile","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"demonstrations. Between Europeans and savages, it is proper for the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Europeans to parry sharply, not to attack.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"During low water the natives roamed about near the _Nautilus_, but were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"not troublesome; I heard them frequently repeat the word “Assai,” and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"by their gestures I understood that they invited me to go on land, an","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"invitation that I declined.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"So that, on that day, the boat did not push off, to the great","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"displeasure of Master Land, who could not complete his provisions.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"This adroit Canadian employed his time in preparing the viands and meat","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that he had brought off the island. As for the savages, they returned","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to the shore about eleven o’clock in the morning, as soon as the coral","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"tops began to disappear under the rising tide; but I saw their numbers","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"had increased considerably on the shore. Probably they came from the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"neighbouring islands, or very likely from Papua. However, I had not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"seen a single native canoe. Having nothing better to do, I thought of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"dragging these beautiful limpid waters, under which I saw a profusion","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of shells, zoophytes, and marine plants. Moreover, it was the last day","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that the _Nautilus_ would pass in these parts, if it float in open sea","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the next day, according to Captain Nemo’s promise.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I therefore called Conseil, who brought me a little light drag, very","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"like those for the oyster fishery. Now to work! For two hours we fished","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"unceasingly, but without bringing up any rarities. The drag was filled","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with midas-ears, harps, melames, and particularly the most beautiful","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hammers I have ever seen. We also brought up some sea-slugs,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pearl-oysters, and a dozen little turtles that were reserved for the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pantry on board.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"But just when I expected it least, I put my hand on a wonder, I might","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"say a natural deformity, very rarely met with. Conseil was just","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"dragging, and his net came up filled with divers ordinary shells, when,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"all at once, he saw me plunge my arm quickly into the net, to draw out","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a shell, and heard me utter a cry.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“What is the matter, sir?” he asked in surprise. “Has master been","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"bitten?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“No, my boy; but I would willingly have given a finger for my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"discovery.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“What discovery?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“This shell,” I said, holding up the object of my triumph.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“It is simply an olive porphyry, genus olive, order of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pectinibranchidæ, class of gasteropods, sub-class mollusca.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, Conseil; but, instead of being rolled from right to left, this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"olive turns from left to right.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Is it possible?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, my boy; it is a left shell.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Shells are all right-handed, with rare exceptions; and, when by chance","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"their spiral is left, amateurs are ready to pay their weight in gold.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Conseil and I were absorbed in the contemplation of our treasure, and I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was promising myself to enrich the museum with it, when a stone","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"unfortunately thrown by a native struck against, and broke, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"precious object in Conseil’s hand. I uttered a cry of despair! Conseil","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"took up his gun, and aimed at a savage who was poising his sling at ten","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"yards from him. I would have stopped him, but his blow took effect and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"broke the bracelet of amulets which encircled the arm of the savage.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"[Illustration] Conseil seized his gun","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Conseil!” cried I. “Conseil!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well, sir! do you not see that the cannibal has commenced the attack?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“A shell is not worth the life of a man,” said I.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Ah! the scoundrel!” cried Conseil; “I would rather he had broken my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shoulder!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Conseil was in earnest, but I was not of his opinion. However, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"situation had changed some minutes before, and we had not perceived. A","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"score of canoes surrounded the _Nautilus_. These canoes, scooped out of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the trunk of a tree, long, narrow, well adapted for speed, were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"balanced by means of a long bamboo pole, which floated on the water.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"They were managed by skilful, half-naked paddlers, and I watched their","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"advance with some uneasiness. It was evident that these Papuans had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"already had dealings with the Europeans and knew their ships. But this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"long iron cylinder anchored in the bay, without masts or chimneys, what","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"could they think of it? Nothing good, for at first they kept at a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"respectful distance. However, seeing it motionless, by degrees they","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"took courage, and sought to familiarise themselves with it. Now this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"familiarity was precisely what it was necessary to avoid. Our arms,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which were noiseless, could only produce a moderate effect on the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"savages, who have little respect for aught but blustering things. The","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"thunderbolt without the reverberations of thunder would frighten man","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"but little, though the danger lies in the lightning, not in the noise.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At this moment the canoes approached the _Nautilus_, and a shower of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"arrows alighted on her.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I went down to the saloon, but found no one there. I ventured to knock","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"at the door that opened into the Captain’s room. “Come in,” was the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"answer.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I entered, and found Captain Nemo deep in algebraical calculations of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_x_ and other quantities.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I am disturbing you,” said I, for courtesy’s sake.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“That is true, M. Aronnax,” replied the Captain; “but I think you have","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"serious reasons for wishing to see me?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Very grave ones; the natives are surrounding us in their canoes, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in a few minutes we shall certainly be attacked by many hundreds of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"savages.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Ah!” said Captain Nemo quietly, “they are come with their canoes?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, sir.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well, sir, we must close the hatches.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Exactly, and I came to say to you——”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Nothing can be more simple,” said Captain Nemo. And, pressing an","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"electric button, he transmitted an order to the ship’s crew.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“It is all done, sir,” said he, after some moments. “The pinnace is","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ready, and the hatches are closed. You do not fear, I imagine, that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"these gentlemen could stave in walls on which the balls of your frigate","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"have had no effect?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“No, Captain; but a danger still exists.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“What is that, sir?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“It is that to-morrow, at about this hour, we must open the hatches to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"renew the air of the _Nautilus_. Now, if, at this moment, the Papuans","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"should occupy the platform, I do not see how you could prevent them","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"from entering.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Then, sir, you suppose that they will board us?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I am certain of it.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well, sir, let them come. I see no reason for hindering them. After","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"all, these Papuans are poor creatures, and I am unwilling that my visit","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to the island should cost the life of a single one of these wretches.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Upon that I was going away; But Captain Nemo detained me, and asked me","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to sit down by him. He questioned me with interest about our excursions","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"on shore, and our hunting; and seemed not to understand the craving for","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"meat that possessed the Canadian. Then the conversation turned on","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"various subjects, and, without being more communicative, Captain Nemo","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"showed himself more amiable.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Amongst other things, we happened to speak of the situation of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_, run aground in exactly the same spot in this strait where","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Dumont d’Urville was nearly lost. Apropos of this:","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“This D’Urville was one of your great sailors,” said the Captain to me,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“one of your most intelligent navigators. He is the Captain Cook of you","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Frenchmen. Unfortunate man of science, after having braved the icebergs","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the South Pole, the coral reefs of Oceania, the cannibals of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Pacific, to perish miserably in a railway train! If this energetic man","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"could have reflected during the last moments of his life, what must","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"have been uppermost in his last thoughts, do you suppose?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"So speaking, Captain Nemo seemed moved, and his emotion gave me a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"better opinion of him. Then, chart in hand, we reviewed the travels of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the French navigator, his voyages of circumnavigation, his double","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"detention at the South Pole, which led to the discovery of Adelaide and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Louis Philippe, and fixing the hydrographical bearings of the principal","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"islands of Oceania.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“That which your D’Urville has done on the surface of the seas,” said","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo, “that have I done under them, and more easily, more","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"completely than he. The Astrolabe and the Zelee, incessantly tossed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"about by the hurricane, could not be worth the _Nautilus_, quiet","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"repository of labour that she is, truly motionless in the midst of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"waters.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“To-morrow,” added the Captain, rising, “to-morrow, at twenty minutes","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to three p.m., the _Nautilus_ shall float, and leave the Strait of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Torres uninjured.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Having curtly pronounced these words, Captain Nemo bowed slightly. This","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was to dismiss me, and I went back to my room.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"There I found Conseil, who wished to know the result of my interview","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with the Captain.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“My boy,” said I, “when I feigned to believe that his _Nautilus_ was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"threatened by the natives of Papua, the Captain answered me very","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sarcastically. I have but one thing to say to you: Have confidence in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"him, and go to sleep in peace.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Have you no need of my services, sir?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“No, my friend. What is Ned Land doing?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“If you will excuse me, sir,” answered Conseil, “friend Ned is busy","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"making a kangaroo-pie which will be a marvel.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I remained alone and went to bed, but slept indifferently. I heard the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"noise of the savages, who stamped on the platform, uttering deafening","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cries. The night passed thus, without disturbing the ordinary repose of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the crew. The presence of these cannibals affected them no more than","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the soldiers of a masked battery care for the ants that crawl over its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"front.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At six in the morning I rose. The hatches had not been opened. The","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"inner air was not renewed, but the reservoirs, filled ready for any","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"emergency, were now resorted to, and discharged several cubic feet of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"oxygen into the exhausted atmosphere of the _Nautilus_.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I worked in my room till noon, without having seen Captain Nemo, even","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"for an instant. On board no preparations for departure were visible.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I waited still some time, then went into the large saloon. The clock","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"marked half-past two. In ten minutes it would be high-tide: and, if","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo had not made a rash promise, the _Nautilus_ would be","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"immediately detached. If not, many months would pass ere she could","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"leave her bed of coral.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"However, some warning vibrations began to be felt in the vessel. I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"heard the keel grating against the rough calcareous bottom of the coral","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"reef.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At five-and-twenty minutes to three, Captain Nemo appeared in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"saloon.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“We are going to start,” said he.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Ah!” replied I.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I have given the order to open the hatches.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“And the Papuans?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“The Papuans?” answered Captain Nemo, slightly shrugging his shoulders.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Will they not come inside the _Nautilus?_”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“How?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Only by leaping over the hatches you have opened.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“M. Aronnax,” quietly answered Captain Nemo, “they will not enter the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hatches of the _Nautilus_ in that way, even if they were open.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I looked at the Captain.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“You do not understand?” said he.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Hardly.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well, come and you will see.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I directed my steps towards the central staircase. There Ned Land and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Conseil were slyly watching some of the ship’s crew, who were opening","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the hatches, while cries of rage and fearful vociferations resounded","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"outside.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The port lids were pulled down outside. Twenty horrible faces appeared.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"But the first native who placed his hand on the stair-rail, struck from","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"behind by some invisible force, I know not what, fled, uttering the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"most fearful cries and making the wildest contortions.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Ten of his companions followed him. They met with the same fate.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Conseil was in ecstasy. Ned Land, carried away by his violent","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"instincts, rushed on to the staircase. But the moment he seized the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rail with both hands, he, in his turn, was overthrown.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I am struck by a thunderbolt,” cried he, with an oath.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"This explained all. It was no rail; but a metallic cable charged with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"electricity from the deck communicating with the platform. Whoever","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"touched it felt a powerful shock—and this shock would have been mortal","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"if Captain Nemo had discharged into the conductor the whole force of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the current. It might truly be said that between his assailants and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"himself he had stretched a network of electricity which none could pass","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with impunity.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Meanwhile, the exasperated Papuans had beaten a retreat paralysed with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"terror. As for us, half laughing, we consoled and rubbed the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"unfortunate Ned Land, who swore like one possessed.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"But at this moment the _Nautilus_, raised by the last waves of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"tide, quitted her coral bed exactly at the fortieth minute fixed by the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain. Her screw swept the waters slowly and majestically. Her speed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"increased gradually, and, sailing on the surface of the ocean, she","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"quitted safe and sound the dangerous passes of the Straits of Torres.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"CHAPTER XXII","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“ÆGRI SOMNIA”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The following day 10th January, the _Nautilus_ continued her course","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"between two seas, but with such remarkable speed that I could not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"estimate it at less than thirty-five miles an hour. The rapidity of her","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"screw was such that I could neither follow nor count its revolutions.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"When I reflected that this marvellous electric agent, after having","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"afforded motion, heat, and light to the _Nautilus_, still protected her","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"from outward attack, and transformed her into an ark of safety which no","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"profane hand might touch without being thunderstricken, my admiration","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was unbounded, and from the structure it extended to the engineer who","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"had called it into existence.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Our course was directed to the west, and on the 11th of January we","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"doubled Cape Wessel, situation in 135° long. and 10° S. lat., which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"forms the east point of the Gulf of Carpentaria. The reefs were still","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"numerous, but more equalised, and marked on the chart with extreme","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"precision. The _Nautilus_ easily avoided the breakers of Money to port","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and the Victoria reefs to starboard, placed at 130° long. and on the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"10th parallel, which we strictly followed.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"On the 13th of January, Captain Nemo arrived in the Sea of Timor, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"recognised the island of that name in 122° long.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"From this point the direction of the _Nautilus_ inclined towards the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"south-west. Her head was set for the Indian Ocean. Where would the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fancy of Captain Nemo carry us next? Would he return to the coast of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Asia or would he approach again the shores of Europe? Improbable","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"conjectures both, to a man who fled from inhabited continents. Then","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"would he descend to the south? Was he going to double the Cape of Good","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Hope, then Cape Horn, and finally go as far as the Antarctic pole?","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Would he come back at last to the Pacific, where his _Nautilus_ could","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sail free and independently? Time would show.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"After having skirted the sands of Cartier, of Hibernia, Seringapatam,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and Scott, last efforts of the solid against the liquid element, on the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"14th of January we lost sight of land altogether. The speed of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_ was considerably abated, and with irregular course she","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sometimes swam in the bosom of the waters, sometimes floated on their","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"surface.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"During this period of the voyage, Captain Nemo made some interesting","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"experiments on the varied temperature of the sea, in different beds.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Under ordinary conditions these observations are made by means of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rather complicated instruments, and with somewhat doubtful results, by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"means of thermometrical sounding-leads, the glasses often breaking","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"under the pressure of the water, or an apparatus grounded on the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"variations of the resistance of metals to the electric currents.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Results so obtained could not be correctly calculated. On the contrary,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo went himself to test the temperature in the depths of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sea, and his thermometer, placed in communication with the different","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sheets of water, gave him the required degree immediately and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"accurately.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"It was thus that, either by overloading her reservoirs or by descending","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"obliquely by means of her inclined planes, the _Nautilus_ successively","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"attained the depth of three, four, five, seven, nine, and ten thousand","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"yards, and the definite result of this experience was that the sea","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"preserved an average temperature of four degrees and a half at a depth","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of five thousand fathoms under all latitudes.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"On the 16th of January, the _Nautilus_ seemed becalmed only a few yards","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"beneath the surface of the waves. Her electric apparatus remained","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"inactive and her motionless screw left her to drift at the mercy of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"currents. I supposed that the crew was occupied with interior repairs,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rendered necessary by the violence of the mechanical movements of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"machine.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"My companions and I then witnessed a curious spectacle. The hatches of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the saloon were open, and, as the beacon light of the _Nautilus_ was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"not in action, a dim obscurity reigned in the midst of the waters. I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"observed the state of the sea, under these conditions, and the largest","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fish appeared to me no more than scarcely defined shadows, when the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_ found herself suddenly transported into full light. I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"thought at first that the beacon had been lighted, and was casting its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"electric radiance into the liquid mass. I was mistaken, and after a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rapid survey perceived my error.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The _Nautilus_ floated in the midst of a phosphorescent bed which, in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"this obscurity, became quite dazzling. It was produced by myriads of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"luminous animalculae, whose brilliancy was increased as they glided","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"over the metallic hull of the vessel. I was surprised by lightning in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the midst of these luminous sheets, as though they had been rivulets of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"lead melted in an ardent furnace or metallic masses brought to a white","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"heat, so that, by force of contrast, certain portions of light appeared","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to cast a shade in the midst of the general ignition, from which all","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shade seemed banished. No; this was not the calm irradiation of our","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ordinary lightning. There was unusual life and vigour: this was truly","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"living light!","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"In reality, it was an infinite agglomeration of coloured infusoria, of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"veritable globules of jelly, provided with a threadlike tentacle, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of which as many as twenty-five thousand have been counted in less than","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"two cubic half-inches of water.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"During several hours the _Nautilus_ floated in these brilliant waves,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and our admiration increased as we watched the marine monsters","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"disporting themselves like salamanders. I saw there in the midst of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"this fire that burns not the swift and elegant porpoise (the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"indefatigable clown of the ocean), and some swordfish ten feet long,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"those prophetic heralds of the hurricane whose formidable sword would","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"now and then strike the glass of the saloon. Then appeared the smaller","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fish, the balista, the leaping mackerel, wolf-thorn-tails, and a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hundred others which striped the luminous atmosphere as they swam. This","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"dazzling spectacle was enchanting! Perhaps some atmospheric condition","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"increased the intensity of this phenomenon. Perhaps some storm agitated","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the surface of the waves. But at this depth of some yards, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_ was unmoved by its fury and reposed peacefully in still","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"water.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"So we progressed, incessantly charmed by some new marvel. The days","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"passed rapidly away, and I took no account of them. Ned, according to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"habit, tried to vary the diet on board. Like snails, we were fixed to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"our shells, and I declare it is easy to lead a snail’s life.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Thus this life seemed easy and natural, and we thought no longer of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"life we led on land; but something happened to recall us to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"strangeness of our situation.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"On the 18th of January, the _Nautilus_ was in 105° long. and 15° S.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"lat. The weather was threatening, the sea rough and rolling. There was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a strong east wind. The barometer, which had been going down for some","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"days, foreboded a coming storm. I went up on to the platform just as","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the second lieutenant was taking the measure of the horary angles, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"waited, according to habit till the daily phrase was said. But on this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"day it was exchanged for another phrase not less incomprehensible.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Almost directly, I saw Captain Nemo appear with a glass, looking","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"towards the horizon.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"For some minutes he was immovable, without taking his eye off the point","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of observation. Then he lowered his glass and exchanged a few words","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with his lieutenant. The latter seemed to be a victim to some emotion","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that he tried in vain to repress. Captain Nemo, having more command","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"over himself, was cool. He seemed, too, to be making some objections to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which the lieutenant replied by formal assurances. At least I concluded","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"so by the difference of their tones and gestures. For myself, I had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"looked carefully in the direction indicated without seeing anything.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The sky and water were lost in the clear line of the horizon.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"However, Captain Nemo walked from one end of the platform to the other,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"without looking at me, perhaps without seeing me. His step was firm,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"but less regular than usual. He stopped sometimes, crossed his arms,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and observed the sea. What could he be looking for on that immense","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"expanse?","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The _Nautilus_ was then some hundreds of miles from the nearest coast.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The lieutenant had taken up the glass and examined the horizon","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"steadfastly, going and coming, stamping his foot and showing more","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"nervous agitation than his superior officer. Besides, this mystery must","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"necessarily be solved, and before long; for, upon an order from Captain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Nemo, the engine, increasing its propelling power, made the screw turn","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"more rapidly.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Just then the lieutenant drew the Captain’s attention again. The latter","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"stopped walking and directed his glass towards the place indicated. He","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"looked long. I felt very much puzzled, and descended to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"drawing-room, and took out an excellent telescope that I generally","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"used. Then, leaning on the cage of the watch-light that jutted out from","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the front of the platform, set myself to look over all the line of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sky and sea.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"But my eye was no sooner applied to the glass than it was quickly","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"snatched out of my hands.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I turned round. Captain Nemo was before me, but I did not know him. His","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"face was transfigured. His eyes flashed sullenly; his teeth were set;","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"his stiff body, clenched fists, and head shrunk between his shoulders,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"betrayed the violent agitation that pervaded his whole frame. He did","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"not move. My glass, fallen from his hands, had rolled at his feet.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Had I unwittingly provoked this fit of anger? Did this incomprehensible","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"person imagine that I had discovered some forbidden secret? No; I was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"not the object of this hatred, for he was not looking at me; his eye","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was steadily fixed upon the impenetrable point of the horizon. At last","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo recovered himself. His agitation subsided. He addressed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"some words in a foreign language to his lieutenant, then turned to me.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“M. Aronnax,” he said, in rather an imperious tone, “I require you to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"keep one of the conditions that bind you to me.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“What is it, Captain?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“You must be confined, with your companions, until I think fit to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"release you.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“You are the master,” I replied, looking steadily at him. “But may I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ask you one question?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“None, sir.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"There was no resisting this imperious command, it would have been","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"useless. I went down to the cabin occupied by Ned Land and Conseil, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"told them the Captain’s determination. You may judge how this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"communication was received by the Canadian.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"But there was not time for altercation. Four of the crew waited at the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"door, and conducted us to that cell where we had passed our first night","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"on board the _Nautilus_.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Ned Land would have remonstrated, but the door was shut upon him.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Will master tell me what this means?” asked Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I told my companions what had passed. They were as much astonished as","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I, and equally at a loss how to account for it.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Meanwhile, I was absorbed in my own reflections, and could think of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"nothing but the strange fear depicted in the Captain’s countenance. I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was utterly at a loss to account for it, when my cogitations were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"disturbed by these words from Ned Land:","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Hallo! breakfast is ready.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"And indeed the table was laid. Evidently Captain Nemo had given this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"order at the same time that he had hastened the speed of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Will master permit me to make a recommendation?” asked Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, my boy.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well, it is that master breakfasts. It is prudent, for we do not know","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"what may happen.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“You are right, Conseil.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Unfortunately,” said Ned Land, “they have only given us the ship’s","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fare.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Friend Ned,” asked Conseil, “what would you have said if the breakfast","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"had been entirely forgotten?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"This argument cut short the harpooner’s recriminations.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"We sat down to table. The meal was eaten in silence.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Just then the luminous globe that lighted the cell went out, and left","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"us in total darkness. Ned Land was soon asleep, and what astonished me","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was that Conseil went off into a heavy slumber. I was thinking what","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"could have caused his irresistible drowsiness, when I felt my brain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"becoming stupefied. In spite of my efforts to keep my eyes open, they","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"would close. A painful suspicion seized me. Evidently soporific","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"substances had been mixed with the food we had just taken. Imprisonment","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was not enough to conceal Captain Nemo’s projects from us, sleep was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"more necessary. I then heard the panels shut. The undulations of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sea, which caused a slight rolling motion, ceased. Had the _Nautilus_","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"quitted the surface of the ocean? Had it gone back to the motionless","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"bed of water? I tried to resist sleep. It was impossible. My breathing","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"grew weak. I felt a mortal cold freeze my stiffened and half-paralysed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"limbs. My eye lids, like leaden caps, fell over my eyes. I could not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"raise them; a morbid sleep, full of hallucinations, bereft me of my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"being. Then the visions disappeared, and left me in complete","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"insensibility.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"THE CORAL KINGDOM","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The next day I woke with my head singularly clear. To my great","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"surprise, I was in my own room. My companions, no doubt, had been","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"reinstated in their cabin, without having perceived it any more than I.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Of what had passed during the night they were as ignorant as I was, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to penetrate this mystery I only reckoned upon the chances of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"future.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I then thought of quitting my room. Was I free again or a prisoner?","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Quite free. I opened the door, went to the half-deck, went up the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"central stairs. The panels, shut the evening before, were open. I went","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"on to the platform.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Ned Land and Conseil waited there for me. I questioned them; they knew","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"nothing. Lost in a heavy sleep in which they had been totally","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"unconscious, they had been astonished at finding themselves in their","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cabin.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"As for the _Nautilus_, it seemed quiet and mysterious as ever. It","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"floated on the surface of the waves at a moderate pace. Nothing seemed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"changed on board.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The second lieutenant then came on to the platform, and gave the usual","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"order below.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"As for Captain Nemo, he did not appear.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Of the people on board, I only saw the impassive steward, who served me","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with his usual dumb regularity.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"About two o’clock, I was in the drawing-room, busied in arranging my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"notes, when the Captain opened the door and appeared. I bowed. He made","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a slight inclination in return, without speaking. I resumed my work,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hoping that he would perhaps give me some explanation of the events of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the preceding night. He made none. I looked at him. He seemed fatigued;","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"his heavy eyes had not been refreshed by sleep; his face looked very","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sorrowful. He walked to and fro, sat down and got up again, took a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"chance book, put it down, consulted his instruments without taking his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"habitual notes, and seemed restless and uneasy. At last, he came up to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"me, and said:","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Are you a doctor, M. Aronnax?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I so little expected such a question that I stared some time at him","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"without answering.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Are you a doctor?” he repeated. “Several of your colleagues have","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"studied medicine.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well,” said I, “I am a doctor and resident surgeon to the hospital. I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"practised several years before entering the museum.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Very well, sir.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"My answer had evidently satisfied the Captain. But, not knowing what he","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"would say next, I waited for other questions, reserving my answers","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"according to circumstances.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“M. Aronnax, will you consent to prescribe for one of my men?” he","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"asked.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Is he ill?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I am ready to follow you.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Come, then.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I own my heart beat, I do not know why. I saw certain connection","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"between the illness of one of the crew and the events of the day","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"before; and this mystery interested me at least as much as the sick","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"man.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo conducted me to the poop of the _Nautilus_, and took me","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"into a cabin situated near the sailors’ quarters.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"There, on a bed, lay a man about forty years of age, with a resolute","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"expression of countenance, a true type of an Anglo-Saxon.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I leant over him. He was not only ill, he was wounded. His head,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"swathed in bandages covered with blood, lay on a pillow. I undid the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"bandages, and the wounded man looked at me with his large eyes and gave","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"no sign of pain as I did it. It was a horrible wound. The skull,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shattered by some deadly weapon, left the brain exposed, which was much","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"injured. Clots of blood had formed in the bruised and broken mass, in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"colour like the dregs of wine.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"There was both contusion and suffusion of the brain. His breathing was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"slow, and some spasmodic movements of the muscles agitated his face. I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"felt his pulse. It was intermittent. The extremities of the body were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"growing cold already, and I saw death must inevitably ensue. After","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"dressing the unfortunate man’s wounds, I readjusted the bandages on his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"head, and turned to Captain Nemo.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“What caused this wound?” I asked.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“What does it signify?” he replied, evasively. “A shock has broken one","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the levers of the engine, which struck myself. But your opinion as","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to his state?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I hesitated before giving it.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“You may speak,” said the Captain. “This man does not understand","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"French.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I gave a last look at the wounded man.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“He will be dead in two hours.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Can nothing save him?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Nothing.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo’s hand contracted, and some tears glistened in his eyes,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which I thought incapable of shedding any.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"For some moments I still watched the dying man, whose life ebbed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"slowly. His pallor increased under the electric light that was shed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"over his death-bed. I looked at his intelligent forehead, furrowed with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"premature wrinkles, produced probably by misfortune and sorrow. I tried","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to learn the secret of his life from the last words that escaped his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"lips.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“You can go now, M. Aronnax,” said the Captain.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I left him in the dying man’s cabin, and returned to my room much","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"affected by this scene. During the whole day, I was haunted by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"uncomfortable suspicions, and at night I slept badly, and between my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"broken dreams I fancied I heard distant sighs like the notes of a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"funeral psalm. Were they the prayers of the dead, murmured in that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"language that I could not understand?","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The next morning I went on to the bridge. Captain Nemo was there before","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"me. As soon as he perceived me he came to me.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Professor, will it be convenient to you to make a submarine excursion","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to-day?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“With my companions?” I asked.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“If they like.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“We obey your orders, Captain.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Will you be so good then as to put on your cork jackets?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"It was not a question of dead or dying. I rejoined Ned Land and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Conseil, and told them of Captain Nemo’s proposition. Conseil hastened","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to accept it, and this time the Canadian seemed quite willing to follow","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"our example.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"It was eight o’clock in the morning. At half-past eight we were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"equipped for this new excursion, and provided with two contrivances for","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"light and breathing. The double door was open; and, accompanied by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo, who was followed by a dozen of the crew, we set foot, at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a depth of about thirty feet, on the solid bottom on which the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_ rested.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"A slight declivity ended in an uneven bottom, at fifteen fathoms depth.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"This bottom differed entirely from the one I had visited on my first","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"excursion under the waters of the Pacific Ocean. Here, there was no","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fine sand, no submarine prairies, no sea-forest. I immediately","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"recognised that marvellous region in which, on that day, the Captain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"did the honours to us. It was the coral kingdom.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The light produced a thousand charming varieties, playing in the midst","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the branches that were so vividly coloured. I seemed to see the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"membraneous and cylindrical tubes tremble beneath the undulation of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"waters. I was tempted to gather their fresh petals, ornamented with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"delicate tentacles, some just blown, the others budding, while a small","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fish, swimming swiftly, touched them slightly, like flights of birds.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"But if my hand approached these living flowers, these animated,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sensitive plants, the whole colony took alarm. The white petals","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"re-entered their red cases, the flowers faded as I looked, and the bush","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"changed into a block of stony knobs.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Chance had thrown me just by the most precious specimens of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"zoophyte. This coral was more valuable than that found in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Mediterranean, on the coasts of France, Italy and Barbary. Its tints","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"justified the poetical names of “Flower of Blood,” and “Froth of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Blood,” that trade has given to its most beautiful productions. Coral","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"is sold for £20 per ounce; and in this place the watery beds would make","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the fortunes of a company of coral-divers. This precious matter, often","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"confused with other polypi, formed then the inextricable plots called","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“macciota,” and on which I noticed several beautiful specimens of pink","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"coral.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"But soon the bushes contract, and the arborisations increase. Real","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"petrified thickets, long joints of fantastic architecture, were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"disclosed before us. Captain Nemo placed himself under a dark gallery,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"where by a slight declivity we reached a depth of a hundred yards. The","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"light from our lamps produced sometimes magical effects, following the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rough outlines of the natural arches and pendants disposed like","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"lustres, that were tipped with points of fire.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At last, after walking two hours, we had attained a depth of about","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"three hundred yards, that is to say, the extreme limit on which coral","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"begins to form. But there was no isolated bush, nor modest brushwood,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"at the bottom of lofty trees. It was an immense forest of large mineral","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"vegetations, enormous petrified trees, united by garlands of elegant","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sea-bindweed, all adorned with clouds and reflections. We passed freely","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"under their high branches, lost in the shade of the waves.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo had stopped. I and my companions halted, and, turning","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"round, I saw his men were forming a semi-circle round their chief.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Watching attentively, I observed that four of them carried on their","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shoulders an object of an oblong shape.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"We occupied, in this place, the centre of a vast glade surrounded by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the lofty foliage of the submarine forest. Our lamps threw over this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"place a sort of clear twilight that singularly elongated the shadows on","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the ground. At the end of the glade the darkness increased, and was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"only relieved by little sparks reflected by the points of coral.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Ned Land and Conseil were near me. We watched, and I thought I was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"going to witness a strange scene. On observing the ground, I saw that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"it was raised in certain places by slight excrescences encrusted with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"limy deposits, and disposed with a regularity that betrayed the hand of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"man.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"In the midst of the glade, on a pedestal of rocks roughly piled up,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"stood a cross of coral that extended its long arms that one might have","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"thought were made of petrified blood. Upon a sign from Captain Nemo one","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the men advanced; and at some feet from the cross he began to dig a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hole with a pickaxe that he took from his belt. I understood all! This","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"glade was a cemetery, this hole a tomb, this oblong object the body of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the man who had died in the night! The Captain and his men had come to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"bury their companion in this general resting-place, at the bottom of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"this inaccessible ocean!","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The grave was being dug slowly; the fish fled on all sides while their","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"retreat was being thus disturbed; I heard the strokes of the pickaxe,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which sparkled when it hit upon some flint lost at the bottom of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"waters. The hole was soon large and deep enough to receive the body.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Then the bearers approached; the body, enveloped in a tissue of white","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"linen, was lowered into the damp grave. Captain Nemo, with his arms","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"crossed on his breast, and all the friends of him who had loved them,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"knelt in prayer.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"[Illustration] All fell on their knees in an attitude of prayer","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The grave was then filled in with the rubbish taken from the ground,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which formed a slight mound. When this was done, Captain Nemo and his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"men rose; then, approaching the grave, they knelt again, and all","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"extended their hands in sign of a last adieu. Then the funeral","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"procession returned to the _Nautilus_, passing under the arches of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"forest, in the midst of thickets, along the coral bushes, and still on","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the ascent. At last the light of the ship appeared, and its luminous","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"track guided us to the _Nautilus_. At one o’clock we had returned.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"As soon as I had changed my clothes I went up on to the platform, and,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a prey to conflicting emotions, I sat down near the binnacle. Captain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Nemo joined me. I rose and said to him:","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“So, as I said he would, this man died in the night?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, M. Aronnax.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“And he rests now, near his companions, in the coral cemetery?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, forgotten by all else, but not by us. We dug the grave, and the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"polypi undertake to seal our dead for eternity.” And, burying his face","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"quickly in his hands, he tried in vain to suppress a sob. Then he","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"added: “Our peaceful cemetery is there, some hundred feet below the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"surface of the waves.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Your dead sleep quietly, at least, Captain, out of the reach of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sharks.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, sir, of sharks and men,” gravely replied the Captain.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"CHAPTER I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"THE INDIAN OCEAN","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"We now come to the second part of our journey under the sea. The first","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ended with the moving scene in the coral cemetery which left such a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"deep impression on my mind. Thus, in the midst of this great sea,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo’s life was passing, even to his grave, which he had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"prepared in one of its deepest abysses. There, not one of the ocean’s","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"monsters could trouble the last sleep of the crew of the _Nautilus_, of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"those friends riveted to each other in death as in life. “Nor any man,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"either,” had added the Captain. Still the same fierce, implacable","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"defiance towards human society!","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I could no longer content myself with the theory which satisfied","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"That worthy fellow persisted in seeing in the Commander of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_ one of those unknown _savants_ who return mankind contempt","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"for indifference. For him, he was a misunderstood genius who, tired of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"earth’s deceptions, had taken refuge in this inaccessible medium, where","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"he might follow his instincts freely. To my mind, this explains but one","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"side of Captain Nemo’s character. Indeed, the mystery of that last","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"night during which we had been chained in prison, the sleep, and the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"precaution so violently taken by the Captain of snatching from my eyes","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the glass I had raised to sweep the horizon, the mortal wound of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"man, due to an unaccountable shock of the _Nautilus_, all put me on a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"new track. No; Captain Nemo was not satisfied with shunning man. His","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"formidable apparatus not only suited his instinct of freedom, but","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"perhaps also the design of some terrible retaliation.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At this moment nothing is clear to me; I catch but a glimpse of light","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"amidst all the darkness, and I must confine myself to writing as events","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shall dictate.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"That day, the 24th of January, 1868, at noon, the second officer came","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to take the altitude of the sun. I mounted the platform, lit a cigar,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and watched the operation. It seemed to me that the man did not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"understand French; for several times I made remarks in a loud voice,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which must have drawn from him some involuntary sign of attention, if","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"he had understood them; but he remained undisturbed and dumb.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"As he was taking observations with the sextant, one of the sailors of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the _Nautilus_ (the strong man who had accompanied us on our first","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"submarine excursion to the Island of Crespo) came to clean the glasses","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the lantern. I examined the fittings of the apparatus, the strength","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of which was increased a hundredfold by lenticular rings, placed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"similar to those in a lighthouse, and which projected their brilliance","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in a horizontal plane. The electric lamp was combined in such a way as","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to give its most powerful light. Indeed, it was produced in vacuo,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which insured both its steadiness and its intensity. This vacuum","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"economised the graphite points between which the luminous arc was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"developed—an important point of economy for Captain Nemo, who could not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"easily have replaced them; and under these conditions their waste was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"imperceptible. When the _Nautilus_ was ready to continue its submarine","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"journey, I went down to the saloon. The panel was closed, and the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"course marked direct west.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"We were furrowing the waters of the Indian Ocean, a vast liquid plain,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with a surface of 1,200,000,000 of acres, and whose waters are so clear","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and transparent that any one leaning over them would turn giddy. The","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_ usually floated between fifty and a hundred fathoms deep. We","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"went on so for some days. To anyone but myself, who had a great love","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"for the sea, the hours would have seemed long and monotonous; but the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"daily walks on the platform, when I steeped myself in the reviving air","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the ocean, the sight of the rich waters through the windows of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"saloon, the books in the library, the compiling of my memoirs, took up","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"all my time, and left me not a moment of ennui or weariness.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"For some days we saw a great number of aquatic birds, sea-mews or","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"gulls. Some were cleverly killed and, prepared in a certain way, made","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"very acceptable water-game. Amongst large-winged birds, carried a long","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"distance from all lands and resting upon the waves from the fatigue of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"their flight, I saw some magnificent albatrosses, uttering discordant","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cries like the braying of an ass, and birds belonging to the family of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the long-wings.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"As to the fish, they always provoked our admiration when we surprised","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the secrets of their aquatic life through the open panels. I saw many","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"kinds which I never before had a chance of observing.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I shall notice chiefly ostracions peculiar to the Red Sea, the Indian","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Ocean, and that part which washes the coast of tropical America. These","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fishes, like the tortoise, the armadillo, the sea-hedgehog, and the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Crustacea, are protected by a breastplate which is neither chalky nor","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"stony, but real bone. In some it takes the form of a solid triangle, in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"others of a solid quadrangle. Amongst the triangular I saw some an inch","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and a half in length, with wholesome flesh and a delicious flavour;","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"they are brown at the tail, and yellow at the fins, and I recommend","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"their introduction into fresh water, to which a certain number of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sea-fish easily accustom themselves. I would also mention quadrangular","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ostracions, having on the back four large tubercles; some dotted over","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with white spots on the lower part of the body, and which may be tamed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"like birds; trigons provided with spikes formed by the lengthening of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"their bony shell, and which, from their strange gruntings, are called","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“seapigs”; also dromedaries with large humps in the shape of a cone,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"whose flesh is very tough and leathery.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I now borrow from the daily notes of Master Conseil. “Certain fish of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the genus petrodon peculiar to those seas, with red backs and white","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"chests, which are distinguished by three rows of longitudinal","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"filaments; and some electrical, seven inches long, decked in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"liveliest colours. Then, as specimens of other kinds, some ovoides,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"resembling an egg of a dark brown colour, marked with white bands, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"without tails; diodons, real sea-porcupines, furnished with spikes, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"capable of swelling in such a way as to look like cushions bristling","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with darts; hippocampi, common to every ocean; some pegasi with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"lengthened snouts, which their pectoral fins, being much elongated and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"formed in the shape of wings, allow, if not to fly, at least to shoot","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"into the air; pigeon spatulae, with tails covered with many rings of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shell; macrognathi with long jaws, an excellent fish, nine inches long,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and bright with most agreeable colours; pale-coloured calliomores, with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rugged heads; and plenty of chaetpdons, with long and tubular muzzles,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which kill insects by shooting them, as from an air-gun, with a single","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"drop of water. These we may call the flycatchers of the seas.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“In the eighty-ninth genus of fishes, classed by Lacepede, belonging to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the second lower class of bony, characterised by opercules and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"bronchial membranes, I remarked the scorpaena, the head of which is","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"furnished with spikes, and which has but one dorsal fin; these","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"creatures are covered, or not, with little shells, according to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sub-class to which they belong. The second sub-class gives us specimens","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of didactyles fourteen or fifteen inches in length, with yellow rays,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and heads of a most fantastic appearance. As to the first sub-class, it","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"gives several specimens of that singular looking fish appropriately","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"called a ‘seafrog,’ with large head, sometimes pierced with holes,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sometimes swollen with protuberances, bristling with spikes, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"covered with tubercles; it has irregular and hideous horns; its body","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and tail are covered with callosities; its sting makes a dangerous","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"wound; it is both repugnant and horrible to look at.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"From the 21st to the 23rd of January the _Nautilus_ went at the rate of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"two hundred and fifty leagues in twenty-four hours, being five hundred","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and forty miles, or twenty-two miles an hour. If we recognised so many","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"different varieties of fish, it was because, attracted by the electric","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"light, they tried to follow us; the greater part, however, were soon","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"distanced by our speed, though some kept their place in the waters of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the _Nautilus_ for a time. The morning of the 24th, in 12° 5′ S. lat.,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and 94° 33′ long., we observed Keeling Island, a coral formation,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"planted with magnificent cocos, and which had been visited by Mr.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Darwin and Captain Fitzroy. The _Nautilus_ skirted the shores of this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"desert island for a little distance. Its nets brought up numerous","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"specimens of polypi and curious shells of mollusca. Some precious","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"productions of the species of delphinulae enriched the treasures of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo, to which I added an astraea punctifera, a kind of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"parasite polypus often found fixed to a shell.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Soon Keeling Island disappeared from the horizon, and our course was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"directed to the north-west in the direction of the Indian Peninsula.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"From Keeling Island our course was slower and more variable, often","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"taking us into great depths. Several times they made use of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"inclined planes, which certain internal levers placed obliquely to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"waterline. In that way we went about two miles, but without ever","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"obtaining the greatest depths of the Indian Sea, which soundings of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"seven thousand fathoms have never reached. As to the temperature of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"lower strata, the thermometer invariably indicated 4° above zero. I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"only observed that in the upper regions the water was always colder in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the high levels than at the surface of the sea.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"On the 25th of January the ocean was entirely deserted; the _Nautilus_","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"passed the day on the surface, beating the waves with its powerful","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"screw and making them rebound to a great height. Who under such","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"circumstances would not have taken it for a gigantic cetacean? Three","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"parts of this day I spent on the platform. I watched the sea. Nothing","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"on the horizon, till about four o’clock a steamer running west on our","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"counter. Her masts were visible for an instant, but she could not see","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the _Nautilus_, being too low in the water. I fancied this steamboat","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"belonged to the P.O. Company, which runs from Ceylon to Sydney,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"touching at King George’s Point and Melbourne.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At five o’clock in the evening, before that fleeting twilight which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"binds night to day in tropical zones, Conseil and I were astonished by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a curious spectacle.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"It was a shoal of argonauts travelling along on the surface of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ocean. We could count several hundreds. They belonged to the tubercle","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"kind which are peculiar to the Indian seas.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"These graceful molluscs moved backwards by means of their locomotive","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"tube, through which they propelled the water already drawn in. Of their","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"eight tentacles, six were elongated, and stretched out floating on the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"water, whilst the other two, rolled up flat, were spread to the wing","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"like a light sail. I saw their spiral-shaped and fluted shells, which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Cuvier justly compares to an elegant skiff. A boat indeed! It bears the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"creature which secretes it without its adhering to it.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"For nearly an hour the _Nautilus_ floated in the midst of this shoal of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"molluscs. Then I know not what sudden fright they took. But as if at a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"signal every sail was furled, the arms folded, the body drawn in, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shells turned over, changing their centre of gravity, and the whole","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fleet disappeared under the waves. Never did the ships of a squadron","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"manœuvre with more unity.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At that moment night fell suddenly, and the reeds, scarcely raised by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the breeze, lay peaceably under the sides of the _Nautilus_.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The next day, 26th of January, we cut the equator at the eighty-second","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"meridian and entered the northern hemisphere. During the day a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"formidable troop of sharks accompanied us, terrible creatures, which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"multiply in these seas and make them very dangerous. They were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“cestracio philippi” sharks, with brown backs and whitish bellies,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"armed with eleven rows of teeth—eyed sharks—their throat being marked","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with a large black spot surrounded with white like an eye. There were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"also some Isabella sharks, with rounded snouts marked with dark spots.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"These powerful creatures often hurled themselves at the windows of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"saloon with such violence as to make us feel very insecure. At such","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"times Ned Land was no longer master of himself. He wanted to go to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"surface and harpoon the monsters, particularly certain smooth-hound","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sharks, whose mouth is studded with teeth like a mosaic; and large","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"tiger-sharks nearly six yards long, the last named of which seemed to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"excite him more particularly. But the _Nautilus_, accelerating her","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"speed, easily left the most rapid of them behind.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The 27th of January, at the entrance of the vast Bay of Bengal, we met","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"repeatedly a forbidding spectacle, dead bodies floating on the surface","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the water. They were the dead of the Indian villages, carried by the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Ganges to the level of the sea, and which the vultures, the only","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"undertakers of the country, had not been able to devour. But the sharks","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"did not fail to help them at their funeral work.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"About seven o’clock in the evening, the _Nautilus_, half-immersed, was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sailing in a sea of milk. At first sight the ocean seemed lactified.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Was it the effect of the lunar rays? No; for the moon, scarcely two","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"days old, was still lying hidden under the horizon in the rays of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sun. The whole sky, though lit by the sidereal rays, seemed black by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"contrast with the whiteness of the waters.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Conseil could not believe his eyes, and questioned me as to the cause","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of this strange phenomenon. Happily I was able to answer him.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“It is called a milk sea,” I explained. “A large extent of white","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"wavelets often to be seen on the coasts of Amboyna, and in these parts","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the sea.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But, sir,” said Conseil, “can you tell me what causes such an effect?","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"for I suppose the water is not really turned into milk.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“No, my boy; and the whiteness which surprises you is caused only by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the presence of myriads of infusoria, a sort of luminous little worm,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"gelatinous and without colour, of the thickness of a hair, and whose","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"length is not more than seven-thousandths of an inch. These insects","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"adhere to one another sometimes for several leagues.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Several leagues!” exclaimed Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, my boy; and you need not try to compute the number of these","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"infusoria. You will not be able, for, if I am not mistaken, ships have","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"floated on these milk seas for more than forty miles.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Towards midnight the sea suddenly resumed its usual colour; but behind","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"us, even to the limits of the horizon, the sky reflected the whitened","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"waves, and for a long time seemed impregnated with the vague","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"glimmerings of an aurora borealis.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"CHAPTER II","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"A NOVEL PROPOSAL OF CAPTAIN NEMO’S","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"On the 28th of February, when at noon the _Nautilus_ came to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"surface of the sea, in 9° 4′ N. lat., there was land in sight about","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"eight miles to westward. The first thing I noticed was a range of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"mountains about two thousand feet high, the shapes of which were most","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"capricious. On taking the bearings, I knew that we were nearing the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"island of Ceylon, the pearl which hangs from the lobe of the Indian","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Peninsula.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo and his second appeared at this moment. The Captain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"glanced at the map. Then turning to me, said:","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“The Island of Ceylon, noted for its pearl-fisheries. Would you like to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"visit one of them, M. Aronnax?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Certainly, Captain.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well, the thing is easy. Though, if we see the fisheries, we shall not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"see the fishermen. The annual exportation has not yet begun. Never","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"mind, I will give orders to make for the Gulf of Manaar, where we shall","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"arrive in the night.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The Captain said something to his second, who immediately went out.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Soon the _Nautilus_ returned to her native element, and the manometer","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"showed that she was about thirty feet deep.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well, sir,” said Captain Nemo, “you and your companions shall visit","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the Bank of Manaar, and if by chance some fisherman should be there, we","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shall see him at work.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Agreed, Captain!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“By the bye, M. Aronnax you are not afraid of sharks?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Sharks!” exclaimed I.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"This question seemed a very hard one.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well?” continued Captain Nemo.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I admit, Captain, that I am not yet very familiar with that kind of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fish.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“We are accustomed to them,” replied Captain Nemo, “and in time you","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"will be too. However, we shall be armed, and on the road we may be able","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to hunt some of the tribe. It is interesting. So, till to-morrow, sir,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and early.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"This said in a careless tone, Captain Nemo left the saloon. Now, if you","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"were invited to hunt the bear in the mountains of Switzerland, what","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"would you say?","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Very well! to-morrow we will go and hunt the bear.” If you were asked","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to hunt the lion in the plains of Atlas, or the tiger in the Indian","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"jungles, what would you say?","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Ha! ha! it seems we are going to hunt the tiger or the lion!” But when","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"you are invited to hunt the shark in its natural element, you would","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"perhaps reflect before accepting the invitation. As for myself, I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"passed my hand over my forehead, on which stood large drops of cold","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"perspiration. “Let us reflect,” said I, “and take our time. Hunting","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"otters in submarine forests, as we did in the Island of Crespo, will","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pass; but going up and down at the bottom of the sea, where one is","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"almost certain to meet sharks, is quite another thing! I know well that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in certain countries, particularly in the Andaman Islands, the negroes","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"never hesitate to attack them with a dagger in one hand and a running","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"noose in the other; but I also know that few who affront those","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"creatures ever return alive. However, I am not a negro, and if I were I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"think a little hesitation in this case would not be ill-timed.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At this moment Conseil and the Canadian entered, quite composed, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"even joyous. They knew not what awaited them.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Faith, sir,” said Ned Land, “your Captain Nemo—the devil take him!—has","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"just made us a very pleasant offer.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Ah!” said I, “you know?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“If agreeable to you, sir,” interrupted Conseil, “the commander of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_ has invited us to visit the magnificent Ceylon fisheries","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to-morrow, in your company; he did it kindly, and behaved like a real","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"gentleman.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“He said nothing more?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Nothing more, sir, except that he had already spoken to you of this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"little walk.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Sir,” said Conseil, “would you give us some details of the pearl","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fishery?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“As to the fishing itself,” I asked, “or the incidents, which?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“On the fishing,” replied the Canadian; “before entering upon the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ground, it is as well to know something about it.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Very well; sit down, my friends, and I will teach you.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Ned and Conseil seated themselves on an ottoman, and the first thing","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the Canadian asked was:","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Sir, what is a pearl?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“My worthy Ned,” I answered, “to the poet, a pearl is a tear of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sea; to the Orientals, it is a drop of dew solidified; to the ladies,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"it is a jewel of an oblong shape, of a brilliancy of mother-of-pearl","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"substance, which they wear on their fingers, their necks, or their","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ears; for the chemist it is a mixture of phosphate and carbonate of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"lime, with a little gelatine; and lastly, for naturalists, it is simply","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a morbid secretion of the organ that produces the mother-of-pearl","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"amongst certain bivalves.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Branch of molluscs,” said Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Precisely so, my learned Conseil; and, amongst these testacea the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"earshell, the tridacnae, the turbots, in a word, all those which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"secrete mother-of-pearl, that is, the blue, bluish, violet, or white","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"substance which lines the interior of their shells, are capable of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"producing pearls.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Mussels too?” asked the Canadian.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, mussels of certain waters in Scotland, Wales, Ireland, Saxony,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Bohemia, and France.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Good! For the future I shall pay attention,” replied the Canadian.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But,” I continued, “the particular mollusc which secretes the pearl is","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the pearl-oyster, the meleagrina margaritiferct, that precious","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pintadine. The pearl is nothing but a nacreous formation, deposited in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a globular form, either adhering to the oyster shell, or buried in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"folds of the creature. On the shell it is fast; in the flesh it is","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"loose; but always has for a kernel a small hard substance, may be a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"barren egg, may be a grain of sand, around which the pearly matter","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"deposits itself year after year successively, and by thin concentric","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"layers.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Are many pearls found in the same oyster?” asked Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, my boy. Some are a perfect casket. One oyster has been mentioned,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"though I allow myself to doubt it, as having contained no less than a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hundred and fifty sharks.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“A hundred and fifty sharks!” exclaimed Ned Land.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Did I say sharks?” said I hurriedly. “I meant to say a hundred and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fifty pearls. Sharks would not be sense.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Certainly not,” said Conseil; “but will you tell us now by what means","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"they extract these pearls?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“They proceed in various ways. When they adhere to the shell, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fishermen often pull them off with pincers; but the most common way is","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to lay the oysters on mats of the seaweed which covers the banks. Thus","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"they die in the open air; and at the end of ten days they are in a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"forward state of decomposition. They are then plunged into large","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"reservoirs of sea-water; then they are opened and washed.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“The price of these pearls varies according to their size?” asked","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Not only according to their size,” I answered, “but also according to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"their shape, their water (that is, their colour), and their lustre:","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that is, that bright and diapered sparkle which makes them so charming","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to the eye. The most beautiful are called virgin pearls, or paragons.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"They are formed alone in the tissue of the mollusc, are white, often","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"opaque, and sometimes have the transparency of an opal; they are","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"generally round or oval. The round are made into bracelets, the oval","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"into pendants, and, being more precious, are sold singly. Those","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"adhering to the shell of the oyster are more irregular in shape, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"are sold by weight. Lastly, in a lower order are classed those small","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pearls known under the name of seed-pearls; they are sold by measure,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and are especially used in embroidery for church ornaments.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But,” said Conseil, “is this pearl-fishery dangerous?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“No,” I answered, quickly; “particularly if certain precautions are","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"taken.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“What does one risk in such a calling?” said Ned Land, “the swallowing","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of some mouthfuls of sea-water?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“As you say, Ned. By the bye,” said I, trying to take Captain Nemo’s","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"careless tone, “are you afraid of sharks, brave Ned?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I!” replied the Canadian; “a harpooner by profession? It is my trade","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to make light of them.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But,” said I, “it is not a question of fishing for them with an","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"iron-swivel, hoisting them into the vessel, cutting off their tails","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with a blow of a chopper, ripping them up, and throwing their heart","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"into the sea!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Then, it is a question of——”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Precisely.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“In the water?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“In the water.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Faith, with a good harpoon! You know, sir, these sharks are","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ill-fashioned beasts. They turn on their bellies to seize you, and in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that time——”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Ned Land had a way of saying “seize” which made my blood run cold.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well, and you, Conseil, what do you think of sharks?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Me!” said Conseil. “I will be frank, sir.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“So much the better,” thought I.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“If you, sir, mean to face the sharks, I do not see why your faithful","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"servant should not face them with you.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"CHAPTER III","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"A PEARL OF TEN MILLIONS","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The next morning at four o’clock I was awakened by the steward whom","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo had placed at my service. I rose hurriedly, dressed, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"went into the saloon.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo was awaiting me.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“M. Aronnax,” said he, “are you ready to start?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I am ready.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Then please to follow me.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“And my companions, Captain?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“They have been told and are waiting.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Are we not to put on our diver’s dresses?” asked I.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Not yet. I have not allowed the _Nautilus_ to come too near this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"coast, and we are some distance from the Manaar Bank; but the boat is","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ready, and will take us to the exact point of disembarking, which will","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"save us a long way. It carries our diving apparatus, which we will put","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"on when we begin our submarine journey.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo conducted me to the central staircase, which led on the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"platform. Ned and Conseil were already there, delighted at the idea of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the “pleasure party” which was preparing. Five sailors from the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_, with their oars, waited in the boat, which had been made","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fast against the side.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The night was still dark. Layers of clouds covered the sky, allowing","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"but few stars to be seen. I looked on the side where the land lay, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"saw nothing but a dark line enclosing three parts of the horizon, from","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"south-west to north west. The _Nautilus_, having returned during the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"night up the western coast of Ceylon, was now west of the bay, or","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rather gulf, formed by the mainland and the Island of Manaar. There,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"under the dark waters, stretched the pintadine bank, an inexhaustible","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"field of pearls, the length of which is more than twenty miles.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo, Ned Land, Conseil, and I took our places in the stern of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the boat. The master went to the tiller; his four companions leaned on","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"their oars, the painter was cast off, and we sheered off.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The boat went towards the south; the oarsmen did not hurry. I noticed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that their strokes, strong in the water, only followed each other every","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ten seconds, according to the method generally adopted in the navy.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Whilst the craft was running by its own velocity, the liquid drops","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"struck the dark depths of the waves crisply like spats of melted lead.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"A little billow, spreading wide, gave a slight roll to the boat, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"some samphire reeds flapped before it.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"We were silent. What was Captain Nemo thinking of? Perhaps of the land","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"he was approaching, and which he found too near to him, contrary to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Canadian’s opinion, who thought it too far off. As to Conseil, he was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"merely there from curiosity.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"About half-past five the first tints on the horizon showed the upper","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"line of coast more distinctly. Flat enough in the east, it rose a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"little to the south. Five miles still lay between us, and it was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"indistinct owing to the mist on the water. At six o’clock it became","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"suddenly daylight, with that rapidity peculiar to tropical regions,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which know neither dawn nor twilight. The solar rays pierced the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"curtain of clouds, piled up on the eastern horizon, and the radiant orb","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rose rapidly. I saw land distinctly, with a few trees scattered here","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and there. The boat neared Manaar Island, which was rounded to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"south. Captain Nemo rose from his seat and watched the sea.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At a sign from him the anchor was dropped, but the chain scarcely ran,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"for it was little more than a yard deep, and this spot was one of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"highest points of the bank of pintadines.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Here we are, M. Aronnax,” said Captain Nemo. “You see that enclosed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"bay? Here, in a month will be assembled the numerous fishing boats of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the exporters, and these are the waters their divers will ransack so","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"boldly. Happily, this bay is well situated for that kind of fishing. It","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"is sheltered from the strongest winds; the sea is never very rough","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"here, which makes it favourable for the diver’s work. We will now put","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"on our dresses, and begin our walk.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I did not answer, and, while watching the suspected waves, began with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the help of the sailors to put on my heavy sea-dress. Captain Nemo and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"my companions were also dressing. None of the _Nautilus_ men were to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"accompany us on this new excursion.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Soon we were enveloped to the throat in india-rubber clothing; the air","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"apparatus fixed to our backs by braces. As to the Ruhmkorff apparatus,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"there was no necessity for it. Before putting my head into the copper","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cap, I had asked the question of the Captain.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“They would be useless,” he replied. “We are going to no great depth,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and the solar rays will be enough to light our walk. Besides, it would","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"not be prudent to carry the electric light in these waters; its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"brilliancy might attract some of the dangerous inhabitants of the coast","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"most inopportunely.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"As Captain Nemo pronounced these words, I turned to Conseil and Ned","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Land. But my two friends had already encased their heads in the metal","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cap, and they could neither hear nor answer.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"One last question remained to ask of Captain Nemo.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“And our arms?” asked I; “our guns?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Guns! What for? Do not mountaineers attack the bear with a dagger in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"their hand, and is not steel surer than lead? Here is a strong blade;","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"put it in your belt, and we start.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I looked at my companions; they were armed like us, and, more than","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that, Ned Land was brandishing an enormous harpoon, which he had placed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in the boat before leaving the _Nautilus_.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Then, following the Captain’s example, I allowed myself to be dressed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in the heavy copper helmet, and our reservoirs of air were at once in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"activity. An instant after we were landed, one after the other, in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"about two yards of water upon an even sand. Captain Nemo made a sign","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with his hand, and we followed him by a gentle declivity till we","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"disappeared under the waves.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Over our feet, like coveys of snipe in a bog, rose shoals of fish, of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the genus monoptera, which have no other fins but their tail. I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"recognized the Javanese, a real serpent two and a half feet long, of a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"livid colour underneath, and which might easily be mistaken for a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"conger eel if it were not for the golden stripes on its side. In the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"genus stromateus, whose bodies are very flat and oval, I saw some of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the most brilliant colours, carrying their dorsal fin like a scythe; an","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"excellent eating fish, which, dried and pickled, is known by the name","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of Karawade; then some tranquebars, belonging to the genus","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"apsiphoroides, whose body is covered with a shell cuirass of eight","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"longitudinal plates.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The heightening sun lit the mass of waters more and more. The soil","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"changed by degrees. To the fine sand succeeded a perfect causeway of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"boulders, covered with a carpet of molluscs and zoophytes. Amongst the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"specimens of these branches I noticed some placenae, with thin unequal","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shells, a kind of ostracion peculiar to the Red Sea and the Indian","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Ocean; some orange lucinae with rounded shells; rockfish three feet and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a half long, which raised themselves under the waves like hands ready","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to seize one. There were also some panopyres, slightly luminous; and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"lastly, some oculines, like magnificent fans, forming one of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"richest vegetations of these seas.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"In the midst of these living plants, and under the arbours of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hydrophytes, were layers of clumsy articulates, particularly some","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"raninae, whose carapace formed a slightly rounded triangle; and some","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"horrible looking parthenopes.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At about seven o’clock we found ourselves at last surveying the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"oyster-banks on which the pearl-oysters are reproduced by millions.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo pointed with his hand to the enormous heap of oysters; and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I could well understand that this mine was inexhaustible, for Nature’s","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"creative power is far beyond man’s instinct of destruction. Ned Land,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"faithful to his instinct, hastened to fill a net which he carried by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"his side with some of the finest specimens. But we could not stop. We","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"must follow the Captain, who seemed to guide him self by paths known","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"only to himself. The ground was sensibly rising, and sometimes, on","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"holding up my arm, it was above the surface of the sea. Then the level","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the bank would sink capriciously. Often we rounded high rocks","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"scarped into pyramids. In their dark fractures huge crustacea, perched","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"upon their high claws like some war-machine, watched us with fixed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"eyes, and under our feet crawled various kinds of annelides.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At this moment there opened before us a large grotto dug in a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"picturesque heap of rocks and carpeted with all the thick warp of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"submarine flora. At first it seemed very dark to me. The solar rays","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"seemed to be extinguished by successive gradations, until its vague","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"transparency became nothing more than drowned light. Captain Nemo","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"entered; we followed. My eyes soon accustomed themselves to this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"relative state of darkness. I could distinguish the arches springing","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"capriciously from natural pillars, standing broad upon their granite","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"base, like the heavy columns of Tuscan architecture. Why had our","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"incomprehensible guide led us to the bottom of this submarine crypt? I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was soon to know. After descending a rather sharp declivity, our feet","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"trod the bottom of a kind of circular pit. There Captain Nemo stopped,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and with his hand indicated an object I had not yet perceived. It was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"an oyster of extraordinary dimensions, a gigantic tridacne, a goblet","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which could have contained a whole lake of holy-water, a basin the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"breadth of which was more than two yards and a half, and consequently","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"larger than that ornamenting the saloon of the _Nautilus_. I approached","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"this extraordinary mollusc. It adhered by its filaments to a table of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"granite, and there, isolated, it developed itself in the calm waters of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the grotto. I estimated the weight of this tridacne at 600 lbs. Such an","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"oyster would contain 30 lbs. of meat; and one must have the stomach of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a Gargantua to demolish some dozens of them.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo was evidently acquainted with the existence of this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"bivalve, and seemed to have a particular motive in verifying the actual","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"state of this tridacne. The shells were a little open; the Captain came","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"near and put his dagger between to prevent them from closing; then with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"his hand he raised the membrane with its fringed edges, which formed a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cloak for the creature. There, between the folded plaits, I saw a loose","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pearl, whose size equalled that of a coco-nut. Its globular shape,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"perfect clearness, and admirable lustre made it altogether a jewel of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"inestimable value. Carried away by my curiosity, I stretched out my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hand to seize it, weigh it, and touch it; but the Captain stopped me,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"made a sign of refusal, and quickly withdrew his dagger, and the two","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shells closed suddenly. I then understood Captain Nemo’s intention. In","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"leaving this pearl hidden in the mantle of the tridacne he was allowing","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"it to grow slowly. Each year the secretions of the mollusc would add","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"new concentric circles. I estimated its value at £500,000 at least.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"After ten minutes Captain Nemo stopped suddenly. I thought he had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"halted previously to returning. No; by a gesture he bade us crouch","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"beside him in a deep fracture of the rock, his hand pointed to one part","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the liquid mass, which I watched attentively.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"About five yards from me a shadow appeared, and sank to the ground. The","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"disquieting idea of sharks shot through my mind, but I was mistaken;","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and once again it was not a monster of the ocean that we had anything","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to do with.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"It was a man, a living man, an Indian, a fisherman, a poor devil who, I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"suppose, had come to glean before the harvest. I could see the bottom","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of his canoe anchored some feet above his head. He dived and went up","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"successively. A stone held between his feet, cut in the shape of a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sugar loaf, whilst a rope fastened him to his boat, helped him to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"descend more rapidly. This was all his apparatus. Reaching the bottom,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"about five yards deep, he went on his knees and filled his bag with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"oysters picked up at random. Then he went up, emptied it, pulled up his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"stone, and began the operation once more, which lasted thirty seconds.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The diver did not see us. The shadow of the rock hid us from sight. And","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"how should this poor Indian ever dream that men, beings like himself,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"should be there under the water watching his movements and losing no","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"detail of the fishing? Several times he went up in this way, and dived","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"again. He did not carry away more than ten at each plunge, for he was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"obliged to pull them from the bank to which they adhered by means of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"their strong byssus. And how many of those oysters for which he risked","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"his life had no pearl in them! I watched him closely; his manœuvres","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"were regular; and for the space of half an hour no danger appeared to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"threaten him.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I was beginning to accustom myself to the sight of this interesting","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fishing, when suddenly, as the Indian was on the ground, I saw him make","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a gesture of terror, rise, and make a spring to return to the surface","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the sea.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I understood his dread. A gigantic shadow appeared just above the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"unfortunate diver. It was a shark of enormous size advancing","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"diagonally, his eyes on fire, and his jaws open. I was mute with horror","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and unable to move.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The voracious creature shot towards the Indian, who threw himself on","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"one side to avoid the shark’s fins; but not its tail, for it struck his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"chest and stretched him on the ground.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"This scene lasted but a few seconds: the shark returned, and, turning","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"on his back, prepared himself for cutting the Indian in two, when I saw","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo rise suddenly, and then, dagger in hand, walk straight to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the monster, ready to fight face to face with him. The very moment the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shark was going to snap the unhappy fisherman in two, he perceived his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"new adversary, and, turning over, made straight towards him.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I can still see Captain Nemo’s position. Holding himself well together,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"he waited for the shark with admirable coolness; and, when it rushed at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"him, threw himself on one side with wonderful quickness, avoiding the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shock, and burying his dagger deep into its side. But it was not all","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"over. A terrible combat ensued.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"[Illustration] A terrible combat began","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The shark had seemed to roar, if I might say so. The blood rushed in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"torrents from its wound. The sea was dyed red, and through the opaque","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"liquid I could distinguish nothing more. Nothing more until the moment","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"when, like lightning, I saw the undaunted Captain hanging on to one of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the creature’s fins, struggling, as it were, hand to hand with the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"monster, and dealing successive blows at his enemy, yet still unable to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"give a decisive one.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The shark’s struggles agitated the water with such fury that the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rocking threatened to upset me.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I wanted to go to the Captain’s assistance, but, nailed to the spot","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with horror, I could not stir.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I saw the haggard eye; I saw the different phases of the fight. The","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain fell to the earth, upset by the enormous mass which leant upon","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"him. The shark’s jaws opened wide, like a pair of factory shears, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"it would have been all over with the Captain; but, quick as thought,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"harpoon in hand, Ned Land rushed towards the shark and struck it with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"its sharp point.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The waves were impregnated with a mass of blood. They rocked under the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shark’s movements, which beat them with indescribable fury. Ned Land","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"had not missed his aim. It was the monster’s death-rattle. Struck to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the heart, it struggled in dreadful convulsions, the shock of which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"overthrew Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"But Ned Land had disentangled the Captain, who, getting up without any","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"wound, went straight to the Indian, quickly cut the cord which held him","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to his stone, took him in his arms, and, with a sharp blow of his heel,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"mounted to the surface.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"We all three followed in a few seconds, saved by a miracle, and reached","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the fisherman’s boat.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo’s first care was to recall the unfortunate man to life","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"again. I did not think he could succeed. I hoped so, for the poor","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"creature’s immersion was not long; but the blow from the shark’s tail","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"might have been his death-blow.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Happily, with the Captain’s and Conseil’s sharp friction, I saw","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"consciousness return by degrees. He opened his eyes. What was his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"surprise, his terror even, at seeing four great copper heads leaning","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"over him! And, above all, what must he have thought when Captain Nemo,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"drawing from the pocket of his dress a bag of pearls, placed it in his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hand! This munificent charity from the man of the waters to the poor","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Cingalese was accepted with a trembling hand. His wondering eyes showed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that he knew not to what super-human beings he owed both fortune and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"life.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At a sign from the Captain we regained the bank, and, following the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"road already traversed, came in about half an hour to the anchor which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"held the canoe of the _Nautilus_ to the earth.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Once on board, we each, with the help of the sailors, got rid of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"heavy copper helmet.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo’s first word was to the Canadian.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Thank you, Master Land,” said he.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“It was in revenge, Captain,” replied Ned Land. “I owed you that.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"A ghastly smile passed across the Captain’s lips, and that was all.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“To the _Nautilus_,” said he.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The boat flew over the waves. Some minutes after we met the shark’s","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"dead body floating. By the black marking of the extremity of its fins,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I recognised the terrible melanopteron of the Indian Seas, of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"species of shark so properly called. It was more than twenty-five feet","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"long; its enormous mouth occupied one-third of its body. It was an","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"adult, as was known by its six rows of teeth placed in an isosceles","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"triangle in the upper jaw.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Whilst I was contemplating this inert mass, a dozen of these voracious","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"beasts appeared round the boat; and, without noticing us, threw","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"themselves upon the dead body and fought with one another for the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pieces.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At half-past eight we were again on board the _Nautilus_. There I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"reflected on the incidents which had taken place in our excursion to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the Manaar Bank.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Two conclusions I must inevitably draw from it—one bearing upon the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"unparalleled courage of Captain Nemo, the other upon his devotion to a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"human being, a representative of that race from which he fled beneath","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the sea. Whatever he might say, this strange man had not yet succeeded","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in entirely crushing his heart.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"When I made this observation to him, he answered in a slightly moved","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"tone:","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“That Indian, sir, is an inhabitant of an oppressed country; and I am","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"still, and shall be, to my last breath, one of them!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"CHAPTER IV","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"THE RED SEA","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"In the course of the day of the 29th of January, the island of Ceylon","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"disappeared under the horizon, and the _Nautilus_, at a speed of twenty","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"miles an hour, slid into the labyrinth of canals which separate the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Maldives from the Laccadives. It coasted even the Island of Kiltan, a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"land originally coraline, discovered by Vasco da Gama in 1499, and one","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the nineteen principal islands of the Laccadive Archipelago,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"situated between 10° and 14° 30′ N. lat., and 69° 50′ 72″ E. long.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"We had made 16,220 miles, or 7,500 (French) leagues from our","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"starting-point in the Japanese Seas.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The next day (30th January), when the _Nautilus_ went to the surface of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the ocean there was no land in sight. Its course was N.N.E., in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"direction of the Sea of Oman, between Arabia and the Indian Peninsula,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which serves as an outlet to the Persian Gulf. It was evidently a block","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"without any possible egress. Where was Captain Nemo taking us to? I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"could not say. This, however, did not satisfy the Canadian, who that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"day came to me asking where we were going.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“We are going where our Captain’s fancy takes us, Master Ned.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“His fancy cannot take us far, then,” said the Canadian. “The Persian","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Gulf has no outlet: and, if we do go in, it will not be long before we","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"are out again.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Very well, then, we will come out again, Master Land; and if, after","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the Persian Gulf, the _Nautilus_ would like to visit the Red Sea, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Straits of Bab-el-mandeb are there to give us entrance.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I need not tell you, sir,” said Ned Land, “that the Red Sea is as much","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"closed as the Gulf, as the Isthmus of Suez is not yet cut; and, if it","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was, a boat as mysterious as ours would not risk itself in a canal cut","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with sluices. And again, the Red Sea is not the road to take us back to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Europe.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But I never said we were going back to Europe.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“What do you suppose, then?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I suppose that, after visiting the curious coasts of Arabia and Egypt,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the _Nautilus_ will go down the Indian Ocean again, perhaps cross the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Channel of Mozambique, perhaps off the Mascarenhas, so as to gain the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Cape of Good Hope.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“And once at the Cape of Good Hope?” asked the Canadian, with peculiar","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"emphasis.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well, we shall penetrate into that Atlantic which we do not yet know.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Ah! friend Ned, you are getting tired of this journey under the sea;","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"you are surfeited with the incessantly varying spectacle of submarine","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"wonders. For my part, I shall be sorry to see the end of a voyage which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"it is given to so few men to make.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"For four days, till the 3rd of February, the _Nautilus_ scoured the Sea","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of Oman, at various speeds and at various depths. It seemed to go at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"random, as if hesitating as to which road it should follow, but we","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"never passed the Tropic of Cancer.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"In quitting this sea we sighted Muscat for an instant, one of the most","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"important towns of the country of Oman. I admired its strange aspect,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"surrounded by black rocks upon which its white houses and forts stood","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in relief. I saw the rounded domes of its mosques, the elegant points","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of its minarets, its fresh and verdant terraces. But it was only a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"vision! The _Nautilus_ soon sank under the waves of that part of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sea.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"We passed along the Arabian coast of Mahrah and Hadramaut, for a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"distance of six miles, its undulating line of mountains being","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"occasionally relieved by some ancient ruin. The 5th of February we at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"last entered the Gulf of Aden, a perfect funnel introduced into the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"neck of Bab-el-mandeb, through which the Indian waters entered the Red","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Sea.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The 6th of February, the _Nautilus_ floated in sight of Aden, perched","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"upon a promontory which a narrow isthmus joins to the mainland, a kind","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of inaccessible Gibraltar, the fortifications of which were rebuilt by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the English after taking possession in 1839. I caught a glimpse of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"octagon minarets of this town, which was at one time the richest","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"commercial magazine on the coast.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I certainly thought that Captain Nemo, arrived at this point, would","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"back out again; but I was mistaken, for he did no such thing, much to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"my surprise.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The next day, the 7th of February, we entered the Straits of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Bab-el-mandeb, the name of which, in the Arab tongue, means The Gate of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Tears.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"To twenty miles in breadth, it is only thirty-two in length. And for","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the _Nautilus_, starting at full speed, the crossing was scarcely the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"work of an hour. But I saw nothing, not even the Island of Perim, with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which the British Government has fortified the position of Aden. There","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"were too many English or French steamers of the line of Suez to Bombay,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Calcutta to Melbourne, and from Bourbon to the Mauritius, furrowing","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"this narrow passage, for the _Nautilus_ to venture to show itself. So","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"it remained prudently below. At last about noon, we were in the waters","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the Red Sea.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I would not even seek to understand the caprice which had decided","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo upon entering the gulf. But I quite approved of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_ entering it. Its speed was lessened: sometimes it kept on","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the surface, sometimes it dived to avoid a vessel, and thus I was able","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to observe the upper and lower parts of this curious sea.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The 8th of February, from the first dawn of day, Mocha came in sight,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"now a ruined town, whose walls would fall at a gunshot, yet which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shelters here and there some verdant date-trees; once an important","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"city, containing six public markets, and twenty-six mosques, and whose","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"walls, defended by fourteen forts, formed a girdle of two miles in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"circumference.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The _Nautilus_ then approached the African shore, where the depth of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the sea was greater. There, between two waters clear as crystal,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"through the open panels we were allowed to contemplate the beautiful","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"bushes of brilliant coral and large blocks of rock clothed with a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"splendid fur of green variety of sites and landscapes along these","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sandbanks and algæ and fuci. What an indescribable spectacle, and what","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"variety of sites and landscapes along these sandbanks and volcanic","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"islands which bound the Libyan coast! But where these shrubs appeared","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in all their beauty was on the eastern coast, which the _Nautilus_ soon","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"gained. It was on the coast of Tehama, for there not only did this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"display of zoophytes flourish beneath the level of the sea, but they","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"also formed picturesque interlacings which unfolded themselves about","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sixty feet above the surface, more capricious but less highly coloured","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"than those whose freshness was kept up by the vital power of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"waters.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"What charming hours I passed thus at the window of the saloon! What new","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"specimens of submarine flora and fauna did I admire under the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"brightness of our electric lantern!","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The 9th of February the _Nautilus_ floated in the broadest part of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Red Sea, which is comprised between Souakin, on the west coast, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Komfidah, on the east coast, with a diameter of ninety miles.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"That day at noon, after the bearings were taken, Captain Nemo mounted","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the platform, where I happened to be, and I was determined not to let","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"him go down again without at least pressing him regarding his ulterior","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"projects. As soon as he saw me he approached and graciously offered me","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a cigar.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well, sir, does this Red Sea please you? Have you sufficiently","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"observed the wonders it covers, its fishes, its zoophytes, its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"parterres of sponges, and its forests of coral? Did you catch a glimpse","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the towns on its borders?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, Captain Nemo,” I replied; “and the _Nautilus_ is wonderfully","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fitted for such a study. Ah! it is an intelligent boat!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, sir, intelligent and invulnerable. It fears neither the terrible","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"tempests of the Red Sea, nor its currents, nor its sandbanks.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Certainly,” said I, “this sea is quoted as one of the worst, and in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the time of the ancients, if I am not mistaken, its reputation was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"detestable.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Detestable, M. Aronnax. The Greek and Latin historians do not speak","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"favourably of it, and Strabo says it is very dangerous during the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Etesian winds and in the rainy season. The Arabian Edrisi portrays it","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"under the name of the Gulf of Colzoum, and relates that vessels","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"perished there in great numbers on the sandbanks and that no one would","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"risk sailing in the night. It is, he pretends, a sea subject to fearful","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hurricanes, strewn with inhospitable islands, and ‘which offers nothing","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"good either on its surface or in its depths.’”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“One may see,” I replied, “that these historians never sailed on board","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the _Nautilus_.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Just so,” replied the Captain, smiling; “and in that respect moderns","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"are not more advanced than the ancients. It required many ages to find","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"out the mechanical power of steam. Who knows if, in another hundred","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"years, we may not see a second _Nautilus?_ Progress is slow, M.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Aronnax.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“It is true,” I answered; “your boat is at least a century before its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"time, perhaps an era. What a misfortune that the secret of such an","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"invention should die with its inventor!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo did not reply. After some minutes’ silence he continued:","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“You were speaking of the opinions of ancient historians upon the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"dangerous navigation of the Red Sea.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“It is true,” said I; “but were not their fears exaggerated?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes and no, M. Aronnax,” replied Captain Nemo, who seemed to know the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Red Sea by heart. “That which is no longer dangerous for a modern","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"vessel, well rigged, strongly built, and master of its own course,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"thanks to obedient steam, offered all sorts of perils to the ships of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the ancients. Picture to yourself those first navigators venturing in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ships made of planks sewn with the cords of the palmtree, saturated","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with the grease of the seadog, and covered with powdered resin! They","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"had not even instruments wherewith to take their bearings, and they","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"went by guess amongst currents of which they scarcely knew anything.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Under such conditions shipwrecks were, and must have been, numerous.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"But in our time, steamers running between Suez and the South Seas have","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"nothing more to fear from the fury of this gulf, in spite of contrary","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"trade-winds. The captain and passengers do not prepare for their","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"departure by offering propitiatory sacrifices; and, on their return,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"they no longer go ornamented with wreaths and gilt fillets to thank the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"gods in the neighbouring temple.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I agree with you,” said I; “and steam seems to have killed all","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"gratitude in the hearts of sailors. But, Captain, since you seem to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"have especially studied this sea, can you tell me the origin of its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"name?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“There exist several explanations on the subject, M. Aronnax. Would you","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"like to know the opinion of a chronicler of the fourteenth century?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Willingly.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“This fanciful writer pretends that its name was given to it after the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"passage of the Israelites, when Pharaoh perished in the waves which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"closed at the voice of Moses.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“A poet’s explanation, Captain Nemo,” I replied; “but I cannot content","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"myself with that. I ask you for your personal opinion.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Here it is, M. Aronnax. According to my idea, we must see in this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"appellation of the Red Sea a translation of the Hebrew word ‘Edom’; and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"if the ancients gave it that name, it was on account of the particular","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"colour of its waters.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But up to this time I have seen nothing but transparent waves and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"without any particular colour.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Very likely; but as we advance to the bottom of the gulf, you will see","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"this singular appearance. I remember seeing the Bay of Tor entirely","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"red, like a sea of blood.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“And you attribute this colour to the presence of a microscopic","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"seaweed?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“So, Captain Nemo, it is not the first time you have overrun the Red","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Sea on board the _Nautilus?_”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“No, sir.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“As you spoke a while ago of the passage of the Israelites and of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"catastrophe to the Egyptians, I will ask whether you have met with the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"traces under the water of this great historical fact?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“No, sir; and for a good reason.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“What is it?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“It is that the spot where Moses and his people passed is now so","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"blocked up with sand that the camels can barely bathe their legs there.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"You can well understand that there would not be water enough for my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“And the spot?” I asked.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“The spot is situated a little above the Isthmus of Suez, in the arm","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which formerly made a deep estuary, when the Red Sea extended to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Salt Lakes. Now, whether this passage were miraculous or not, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Israelites, nevertheless, crossed there to reach the Promised Land, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Pharaoh’s army perished precisely on that spot; and I think that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"excavations made in the middle of the sand would bring to light a large","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"number of arms and instruments of Egyptian origin.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“That is evident,” I replied; “and for the sake of archaeologists let","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"us hope that these excavations will be made sooner or later, when new","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"towns are established on the isthmus, after the construction of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Suez Canal; a canal, however, very useless to a vessel like the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Very likely; but useful to the whole world,” said Captain Nemo. “The","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ancients well understood the utility of a communication between the Red","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Sea and the Mediterranean for their commercial affairs: but they did","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"not think of digging a canal direct, and took the Nile as an","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"intermediate. Very probably the canal which united the Nile to the Red","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Sea was begun by Sesostris, if we may believe tradition. One thing is","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"certain, that in the year 615 before Jesus Christ, Necos undertook the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"works of an alimentary canal to the waters of the Nile across the plain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of Egypt, looking towards Arabia. It took four days to go up this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"canal, and it was so wide that two triremes could go abreast. It was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"carried on by Darius, the son of Hystaspes, and probably finished by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Ptolemy II. Strabo saw it navigated: but its decline from the point of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"departure, near Bubastes, to the Red Sea was so slight that it was only","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"navigable for a few months in the year. This canal answered all","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"commercial purposes to the age of Antonius, when it was abandoned and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"blocked up with sand. Restored by order of the Caliph Omar, it was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"definitely destroyed in 761 or 762 by Caliph Al-Mansor, who wished to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"prevent the arrival of provisions to Mohammed-ben-Abdallah, who had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"revolted against him. During the expedition into Egypt, your General","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Bonaparte discovered traces of the works in the Desert of Suez; and,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"surprised by the tide, he nearly perished before regaining Hadjaroth,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"at the very place where Moses had encamped three thousand years before","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"him.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well, Captain, what the ancients dared not undertake, this junction","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"between the two seas, which will shorten the road from Cadiz to India,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"M. Lesseps has succeeded in doing; and before long he will have changed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Africa into an immense island.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, M. Aronnax; you have the right to be proud of your countryman.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Such a man brings more honour to a nation than great captains. He","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"began, like so many others, with disgust and rebuffs; but he has","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"triumphed, for he has the genius of will. And it is sad to think that a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"work like that, which ought to have been an international work and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which would have sufficed to make a reign illustrious, should have","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"succeeded by the energy of one man. All honour to M. Lesseps!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes! honour to the great citizen,” I replied, surprised by the manner","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in which Captain Nemo had just spoken.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Unfortunately,” he continued, “I cannot take you through the Suez","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Canal; but you will be able to see the long jetty of Port Said after","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to-morrow, when we shall be in the Mediterranean.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“The Mediterranean!” I exclaimed.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, sir; does that astonish you?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“What astonishes me is to think that we shall be there the day after","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to-morrow.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Indeed?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, Captain, although by this time I ought to have accustomed myself","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to be surprised at nothing since I have been on board your boat.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But the cause of this surprise?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well! it is the fearful speed you will have to put on the _Nautilus_,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"if the day after to-morrow she is to be in the Mediterranean, having","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"made the round of Africa, and doubled the Cape of Good Hope!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Who told you that she would make the round of Africa and double the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Cape of Good Hope, sir?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well, unless the _Nautilus_ sails on dry land, and passes above the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"isthmus——”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Or beneath it, M. Aronnax.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Beneath it?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Certainly,” replied Captain Nemo quietly. “A long time ago Nature made","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"under this tongue of land what man has this day made on its surface.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“What! such a passage exists?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes; a subterranean passage, which I have named the Arabian Tunnel. It","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"takes us beneath Suez and opens into the Gulf of Pelusium.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But this isthmus is composed of nothing but quick sands?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“To a certain depth. But at fifty-five yards only there is a solid","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"layer of rock.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Did you discover this passage by chance?” I asked more and more","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"surprised.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Chance and reasoning, sir; and by reasoning even more than by chance.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Not only does this passage exist, but I have profited by it several","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"times. Without that I should not have ventured this day into the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"impassable Red Sea. I noticed that in the Red Sea and in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Mediterranean there existed a certain number of fishes of a kind","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"perfectly identical. Certain of the fact, I asked myself was it","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"possible that there was no communication between the two seas? If there","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was, the subterranean current must necessarily run from the Red Sea to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the Mediterranean, from the sole cause of difference of level. I caught","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a large number of fishes in the neighbourhood of Suez. I passed a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"copper ring through their tails, and threw them back into the sea. Some","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"months later, on the coast of Syria, I caught some of my fish","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ornamented with the ring. Thus the communication between the two was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"proved. I then sought for it with my _Nautilus;_ I discovered it,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ventured into it, and before long, sir, you too will have passed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"through my Arabian tunnel!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"CHAPTER V","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"THE ARABIAN TUNNEL","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"That same evening, in 21° 30′ N. lat., the _Nautilus_ floated on the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"surface of the sea, approaching the Arabian coast. I saw Djeddah, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"most important counting-house of Egypt, Syria, Turkey, and India. I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"distinguished clearly enough its buildings, the vessels anchored at the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"quays, and those whose draught of water obliged them to anchor in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"roads. The sun, rather low on the horizon, struck full on the houses of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the town, bringing out their whiteness. Outside, some wooden cabins,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and some made of reeds, showed the quarter inhabited by the Bedouins.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Soon Djeddah was shut out from view by the shadows of night, and the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_ found herself under water slightly phosphorescent.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The next day, the 10th of February, we sighted several ships running to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"windward. The _Nautilus_ returned to its submarine navigation; but at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"noon, when her bearings were taken, the sea being deserted, she rose","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"again to her waterline.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Accompanied by Ned and Conseil, I seated myself on the platform. The","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"coast on the eastern side looked like a mass faintly printed upon a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"damp fog.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"We were leaning on the sides of the pinnace, talking of one thing and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"another, when Ned Land, stretching out his hand towards a spot on the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sea, said:","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Do you see anything there, sir?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“No, Ned,” I replied; “but I have not your eyes, you know.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Look well,” said Ned, “there, on the starboard beam, about the height","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the lantern! Do you not see a mass which seems to move?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Certainly,” said I, after close attention; “I see something like a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"long black body on the top of the water.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"And certainly before long the black object was not more than a mile","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"from us. It looked like a great sandbank deposited in the open sea. It","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was a gigantic dugong!","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Ned Land looked eagerly. His eyes shone with covetousness at the sight","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the animal. His hand seemed ready to harpoon it. One would have","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"thought he was awaiting the moment to throw himself into the sea and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"attack it in its element.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At this instant Captain Nemo appeared on the platform. He saw the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"dugong, understood the Canadian’s attitude, and, addressing him, said:","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“If you held a harpoon just now, Master Land, would it not burn your","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hand?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Just so, sir.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“And you would not be sorry to go back, for one day, to your trade of a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fisherman and to add this cetacean to the list of those you have","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"already killed?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I should not, sir.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well, you can try.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Thank you, sir,” said Ned Land, his eyes flaming.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Only,” continued the Captain, “I advise you for your own sake not to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"miss the creature.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Is the dugong dangerous to attack?” I asked, in spite of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Canadian’s shrug of the shoulders.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes,” replied the Captain; “sometimes the animal turns upon its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"assailants and overturns their boat. But for Master Land this danger is","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"not to be feared. His eye is prompt, his arm sure.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At this moment seven men of the crew, mute and immovable as ever,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"mounted the platform. One carried a harpoon and a line similar to those","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"employed in catching whales. The pinnace was lifted from the bridge,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pulled from its socket, and let down into the sea. Six oarsmen took","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"their seats, and the coxswain went to the tiller. Ned, Conseil, and I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"went to the back of the boat.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“You are not coming, Captain?” I asked.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“No, sir; but I wish you good sport.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The boat put off, and, lifted by the six rowers, drew rapidly towards","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the dugong, which floated about two miles from the _Nautilus_.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Arrived some cables-length from the cetacean, the speed slackened, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the oars dipped noiselessly into the quiet waters. Ned Land, harpoon in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hand, stood in the fore part of the boat. The harpoon used for striking","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the whale is generally attached to a very long cord which runs out","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rapidly as the wounded creature draws it after him. But here the cord","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was not more than ten fathoms long, and the extremity was attached to a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"small barrel which, by floating, was to show the course the dugong took","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"under the water.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I stood and carefully watched the Canadian’s adversary. This dugong,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which also bears the name of the halicore, closely resembles the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"manatee; its oblong body terminated in a lengthened tail, and its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"lateral fins in perfect fingers. Its difference from the manatee","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"consisted in its upper jaw, which was armed with two long and pointed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"teeth which formed on each side diverging tusks.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"This dugong which Ned Land was preparing to attack was of colossal","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"dimensions; it was more than seven yards long. It did not move, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"seemed to be sleeping on the waves, which circumstance made it easier","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to capture.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The boat approached within six yards of the animal. The oars rested on","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the rowlocks. I half rose. Ned Land, his body thrown a little back,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"brandished the harpoon in his experienced hand.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Suddenly a hissing noise was heard, and the dugong disappeared. The","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"harpoon, although thrown with great force; had apparently only struck","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the water.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Curse it!” exclaimed the Canadian furiously; “I have missed it!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“No,” said I; “the creature is wounded—look at the blood; but your","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"weapon has not stuck in his body.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“My harpoon! my harpoon!” cried Ned Land.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The sailors rowed on, and the coxswain made for the floating barrel.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The harpoon regained, we followed in pursuit of the animal.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The latter came now and then to the surface to breathe. Its wound had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"not weakened it, for it shot onwards with great rapidity.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The boat, rowed by strong arms, flew on its track. Several times it","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"approached within some few yards, and the Canadian was ready to strike,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"but the dugong made off with a sudden plunge, and it was impossible to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"reach it.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Imagine the passion which excited impatient Ned Land! He hurled at the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"unfortunate creature the most energetic expletives in the English","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"tongue. For my part, I was only vexed to see the dugong escape all our","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"attacks.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"We pursued it without relaxation for an hour, and I began to think it","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"would prove difficult to capture, when the animal, possessed with the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"perverse idea of vengeance of which he had cause to repent, turned upon","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the pinnace and assailed us in its turn.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"This manœuvre did not escape the Canadian.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Look out!” he cried.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The coxswain said some words in his outlandish tongue, doubtless","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"warning the men to keep on their guard.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The dugong came within twenty feet of the boat, stopped, sniffed the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"air briskly with its large nostrils (not pierced at the extremity, but","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in the upper part of its muzzle). Then, taking a spring, he threw","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"himself upon us.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The pinnace could not avoid the shock, and half upset, shipped at least","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"two tons of water, which had to be emptied; but, thanks to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"coxswain, we caught it sideways, not full front, so we were not quite","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"overturned. While Ned Land, clinging to the bows, belaboured the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"gigantic animal with blows from his harpoon, the creature’s teeth were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"buried in the gunwale, and it lifted the whole thing out of the water,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"as a lion does a roebuck. We were upset over one another, and I know","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"not how the adventure would have ended, if the Canadian, still enraged","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with the beast, had not struck it to the heart.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I heard its teeth grind on the iron plate, and the dugong disappeared,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"carrying the harpoon with him. But the barrel soon returned to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"surface, and shortly after the body of the animal, turned on its back.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The boat came up with it, took it in tow, and made straight for the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"It required tackle of enormous strength to hoist the dugong on to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"platform. It weighed 10,000 lbs.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The next day, 11th February, the larder of the _Nautilus_ was enriched","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"by some more delicate game. A flight of sea-swallows rested on the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_. It was a species of the Sterna nilotica, peculiar to Egypt;","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"its beak is black, head grey and pointed, the eye surrounded by white","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"spots, the back, wings, and tail of a greyish colour, the belly and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"throat white, and claws red. They also took some dozen of Nile ducks, a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"wild bird of high flavour, its throat and upper part of the head white","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with black spots.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"About five o’clock in the evening we sighted to the north the Cape of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Ras-Mohammed. This cape forms the extremity of Arabia Petraea,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"comprised between the Gulf of Suez and the Gulf of Acabah.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The _Nautilus_ penetrated into the Straits of Jubal, which leads to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Gulf of Suez. I distinctly saw a high mountain, towering between the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"two gulfs of Ras-Mohammed. It was Mount Horeb, that Sinai at the top of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which Moses saw God face to face.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At six o’clock the _Nautilus_, sometimes floating, sometimes immersed,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"passed some distance from Tor, situated at the end of the bay, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"waters of which seemed tinted with red, an observation already made by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo. Then night fell in the midst of a heavy silence,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sometimes broken by the cries of the pelican and other night-birds, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the noise of the waves breaking upon the shore, chafing against the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rocks, or the panting of some far-off steamer beating the waters of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Gulf with its noisy paddles.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"From eight to nine o’clock the _Nautilus_ remained some fathoms under","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the water. According to my calculation we must have been very near","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Suez. Through the panel of the saloon I saw the bottom of the rocks","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"brilliantly lit up by our electric lamp. We seemed to be leaving the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Straits behind us more and more.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At a quarter-past nine, the vessel having returned to the surface, I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"mounted the platform. Most impatient to pass through Captain Nemo’s","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"tunnel, I could not stay in one place, so came to breathe the fresh","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"night air.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Soon in the shadow I saw a pale light, half discoloured by the fog,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shining about a mile from us.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“A floating lighthouse!” said someone near me.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I turned, and saw the Captain.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“It is the floating light of Suez,” he continued. “It will not be long","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"before we gain the entrance of the tunnel.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“The entrance cannot be easy?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“No, sir; for that reason I am accustomed to go into the steersman’s","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cage and myself direct our course. And now, if you will go down, M.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Aronnax, the _Nautilus_ is going under the waves, and will not return","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to the surface until we have passed through the Arabian Tunnel.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo led me towards the central staircase; half way down he","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"opened a door, traversed the upper deck, and landed in the pilot’s","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cage, which it may be remembered rose at the extremity of the platform.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"It was a cabin measuring six feet square, very much like that occupied","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"by the pilot on the steamboats of the Mississippi or Hudson. In the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"midst worked a wheel, placed vertically, and caught to the tiller-rope,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which ran to the back of the _Nautilus_. Four light-ports with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"lenticular glasses, let in a groove in the partition of the cabin,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"allowed the man at the wheel to see in all directions.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"This cabin was dark; but soon my eyes accustomed themselves to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"obscurity, and I perceived the pilot, a strong man, with his hands","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"resting on the spokes of the wheel. Outside, the sea appeared vividly","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"lit up by the lantern, which shed its rays from the back of the cabin","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to the other extremity of the platform.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Now,” said Captain Nemo, “let us try to make our passage.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Electric wires connected the pilot’s cage with the machinery room, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"from there the Captain could communicate simultaneously to his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_ the direction and the speed. He pressed a metal knob, and at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"once the speed of the screw diminished.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I looked in silence at the high straight wall we were running by at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"this moment, the immovable base of a massive sandy coast. We followed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"it thus for an hour only some few yards off.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo did not take his eye from the knob, suspended by its two","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"concentric circles in the cabin. At a simple gesture, the pilot","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"modified the course of the _Nautilus_ every instant.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I had placed myself at the port-scuttle, and saw some magnificent","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"substructures of coral, zoophytes, seaweed, and fucus, agitating their","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"enormous claws, which stretched out from the fissures of the rock.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At a quarter-past ten, the Captain himself took the helm. A large","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"gallery, black and deep, opened before us. The _Nautilus_ went boldly","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"into it. A strange roaring was heard round its sides. It was the waters","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the Red Sea, which the incline of the tunnel precipitated violently","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"towards the Mediterranean. The _Nautilus_ went with the torrent, rapid","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"as an arrow, in spite of the efforts of the machinery, which, in order","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to offer more effective resistance, beat the waves with reversed screw.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"On the walls of the narrow passage I could see nothing but brilliant","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rays, straight lines, furrows of fire, traced by the great speed, under","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the brilliant electric light. My heart beat fast.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At thirty-five minutes past ten, Captain Nemo quitted the helm, and,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"turning to me, said:","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“The Mediterranean!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"In less than twenty minutes, the _Nautilus_, carried along by the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"torrent, had passed through the Isthmus of Suez.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The next day, the 12th of February, at the dawn of day, the _Nautilus_","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rose to the surface. I hastened on to the platform. Three miles to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"south the dim outline of Pelusium was to be seen. A torrent had carried","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"us from one sea to another. About seven o’clock Ned and Conseil joined","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"me.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well, Sir Naturalist,” said the Canadian, in a slightly jovial tone,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“and the Mediterranean?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“We are floating on its surface, friend Ned.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“What!” said Conseil, “this very night.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, this very night; in a few minutes we have passed this impassable","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I do not believe it,” replied the Canadian.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Then you are wrong, Master Land,” I continued; “this low coast which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rounds off to the south is the Egyptian coast. And you who have such","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"good eyes, Ned, you can see the jetty of Port Said stretching into the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sea.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The Canadian looked attentively.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Certainly you are right, sir, and your Captain is a first-rate man. We","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"are in the Mediterranean. Good! Now, if you please, let us talk of our","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"own little affair, but so that no one hears us.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I saw what the Canadian wanted, and, in any case, I thought it better","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to let him talk, as he wished it; so we all three went and sat down","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"near the lantern, where we were less exposed to the spray of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"blades.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Now, Ned, we listen; what have you to tell us?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“What I have to tell you is very simple. We are in Europe; and before","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo’s caprices drag us once more to the bottom of the Polar","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Seas, or lead us into Oceania, I ask to leave the _Nautilus_.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I wished in no way to shackle the liberty of my companions, but I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"certainly felt no desire to leave Captain Nemo.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Thanks to him, and thanks to his apparatus, I was each day nearer the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"completion of my submarine studies; and I was rewriting my book of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"submarine depths in its very element. Should I ever again have such an","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"opportunity of observing the wonders of the ocean? No, certainly not!","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"And I could not bring myself to the idea of abandoning the _Nautilus_","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"before the cycle of investigation was accomplished.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Friend Ned, answer me frankly, are you tired of being on board? Are","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"you sorry that destiny has thrown us into Captain Nemo’s hands?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The Canadian remained some moments without answering. Then, crossing","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"his arms, he said:","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Frankly, I do not regret this journey under the seas. I shall be glad","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to have made it; but, now that it is made, let us have done with it.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"That is my idea.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“It will come to an end, Ned.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Where and when?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Where I do not know—when I cannot say; or, rather, I suppose it will","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"end when these seas have nothing more to teach us.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Then what do you hope for?” demanded the Canadian.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“That circumstances may occur as well six months hence as now by which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"we may and ought to profit.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Oh!” said Ned Land, “and where shall we be in six months, if you","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"please, Sir Naturalist?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Perhaps in China; you know the _Nautilus_ is a rapid traveller. It","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"goes through water as swallows through the air, or as an express on the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"land. It does not fear frequented seas; who can say that it may not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"beat the coasts of France, England, or America, on which flight may be","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"attempted as advantageously as here.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“M. Aronnax,” replied the Canadian, “your arguments are rotten at the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"foundation. You speak in the future, ‘We shall be there! we shall be","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"here!’ I speak in the present, ‘We are here, and we must profit by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"it.’”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Ned Land’s logic pressed me hard, and I felt myself beaten on that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ground. I knew not what argument would now tell in my favour.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Sir,” continued Ned, “let us suppose an impossibility: if Captain Nemo","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"should this day offer you your liberty; would you accept it?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I do not know,” I answered.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“And if,” he added, “the offer made you this day was never to be","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"renewed, would you accept it?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Friend Ned, this is my answer. Your reasoning is against me. We must","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"not rely on Captain Nemo’s good-will. Common prudence forbids him to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"set us at liberty. On the other side, prudence bids us profit by the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"first opportunity to leave the _Nautilus_.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well, M. Aronnax, that is wisely said.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Only one observation—just one. The occasion must be serious, and our","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"first attempt must succeed; if it fails, we shall never find another,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and Captain Nemo will never forgive us.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“All that is true,” replied the Canadian. “But your observation applies","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"equally to all attempts at flight, whether in two years’ time, or in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"two days’. But the question is still this: If a favourable opportunity","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"presents itself, it must be seized.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Agreed! And now, Ned, will you tell me what you mean by a favourable","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"opportunity?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“It will be that which, on a dark night, will bring the _Nautilus_ a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"short distance from some European coast.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“And you will try and save yourself by swimming?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, if we were near enough to the bank, and if the vessel was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"floating at the time. Not if the bank was far away, and the boat was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"under the water.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“And in that case?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“In that case, I should seek to make myself master of the pinnace. I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"know how it is worked. We must get inside, and the bolts once drawn, we","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shall come to the surface of the water, without even the pilot, who is","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in the bows, perceiving our flight.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well, Ned, watch for the opportunity; but do not forget that a hitch","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"will ruin us.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I will not forget, sir.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“And now, Ned, would you like to know what I think of your project?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Certainly, M. Aronnax.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well, I think—I do not say I hope—I think that this favourable","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"opportunity will never present itself.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Why not?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Because Captain Nemo cannot hide from himself that we have not given","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"up all hope of regaining our liberty, and he will be on his guard,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"above all, in the seas and in the sight of European coasts.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“We shall see,” replied Ned Land, shaking his head determinedly.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“And now, Ned Land,” I added, “let us stop here. Not another word on","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the subject. The day that you are ready, come and let us know, and we","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"will follow you. I rely entirely upon you.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Thus ended a conversation which, at no very distant time, led to such","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"grave results. I must say here that facts seemed to confirm my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"foresight, to the Canadian’s great despair. Did Captain Nemo distrust","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"us in these frequented seas? or did he only wish to hide himself from","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the numerous vessels, of all nations, which ploughed the Mediterranean?","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I could not tell; but we were oftener between waters and far from the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"coast. Or, if the _Nautilus_ did emerge, nothing was to be seen but the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pilot’s cage; and sometimes it went to great depths, for, between the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Grecian Archipelago and Asia Minor we could not touch the bottom by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"more than a thousand fathoms.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Thus I only knew we were near the Island of Carpathos, one of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Sporades, by Captain Nemo reciting these lines from Virgil:","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Est Carpathio Neptuni gurgite vates,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Caeruleus Proteus,”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"as he pointed to a spot on the planisphere.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"It was indeed the ancient abode of Proteus, the old shepherd of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Neptune’s flocks, now the Island of Scarpanto, situated between Rhodes","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and Crete. I saw nothing but the granite base through the glass panels","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the saloon.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The next day, the 14th of February, I resolved to employ some hours in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"studying the fishes of the Archipelago; but for some reason or other","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the panels remained hermetically sealed. Upon taking the course of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_, I found that we were going towards Candia, the ancient Isle","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of Crete. At the time I embarked on the _Abraham Lincoln_, the whole of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"this island had risen in insurrection against the despotism of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Turks. But how the insurgents had fared since that time I was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"absolutely ignorant, and it was not Captain Nemo, deprived of all land","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"communications, who could tell me.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I made no allusion to this event when that night I found myself alone","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with him in the saloon. Besides, he seemed to be taciturn and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"preoccupied. Then, contrary to his custom, he ordered both panels to be","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"opened, and, going from one to the other, observed the mass of waters","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"attentively. To what end I could not guess; so, on my side, I employed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"my time in studying the fish passing before my eyes.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"In the midst of the waters a man appeared, a diver, carrying at his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"belt a leathern purse. It was not a body abandoned to the waves; it was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a living man, swimming with a strong hand, disappearing occasionally to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"take breath at the surface.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I turned towards Captain Nemo, and in an agitated voice exclaimed:","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“A man shipwrecked! He must be saved at any price!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"[Illustration] “A man! A shipwrecked sailor!” I cried","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The Captain did not answer me, but came and leaned against the panel.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The man had approached, and, with his face flattened against the glass,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was looking at us.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"To my great amazement, Captain Nemo signed to him. The diver answered","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with his hand, mounted immediately to the surface of the water, and did","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"not appear again.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Do not be uncomfortable,” said Captain Nemo. “It is Nicholas of Cape","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Matapan, surnamed Pesca. He is well known in all the Cyclades. A bold","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"diver! water is his element, and he lives more in it than on land,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"going continually from one island to another, even as far as Crete.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“You know him, Captain?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Why not, M. Aronnax?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Saying which, Captain Nemo went towards a piece of furniture standing","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"near the left panel of the saloon. Near this piece of furniture, I saw","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a chest bound with iron, on the cover of which was a copper plate,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"bearing the cypher of the _Nautilus_ with its device.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At that moment, the Captain, without noticing my presence, opened the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"piece of furniture, a sort of strong box, which held a great many","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ingots.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"They were ingots of gold. From whence came this precious metal, which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"represented an enormous sum? Where did the Captain gather this gold","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"from? and what was he going to do with it?","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I did not say one word. I looked. Captain Nemo took the ingots one by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"one, and arranged them methodically in the chest, which he filled","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"entirely. I estimated the contents at more than 4,000 lbs. weight of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"gold, that is to say, nearly £200,000.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The chest was securely fastened, and the Captain wrote an address on","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the lid, in characters which must have belonged to Modern Greece.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"This done, Captain Nemo pressed a knob, the wire of which communicated","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with the quarters of the crew. Four men appeared, and, not without some","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"trouble, pushed the chest out of the saloon. Then I heard them hoisting","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"it up the iron staircase by means of pulleys.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At that moment, Captain Nemo turned to me.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“And you were saying, sir?” said he.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I was saying nothing, Captain.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Then, sir, if you will allow me, I will wish you good night.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Whereupon he turned and left the saloon.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I returned to my room much troubled, as one may believe. I vainly tried","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to sleep—I sought the connecting link between the apparition of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"diver and the chest filled with gold. Soon, I felt by certain movements","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of pitching and tossing that the _Nautilus_ was leaving the depths and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"returning to the surface.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Then I heard steps upon the platform; and I knew they were unfastening","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the pinnace and launching it upon the waves. For one instant it struck","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the side of the _Nautilus_, then all noise ceased.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Two hours after, the same noise, the same going and coming was renewed;","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the boat was hoisted on board, replaced in its socket, and the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_ again plunged under the waves.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"So these millions had been transported to their address. To what point","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the continent? Who was Captain Nemo’s correspondent?","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The next day I related to Conseil and the Canadian the events of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"night, which had excited my curiosity to the highest degree. My","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"companions were not less surprised than myself.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But where does he take his millions to?” asked Ned Land.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"To that there was no possible answer. I returned to the saloon after","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"having breakfast and set to work. Till five o’clock in the evening I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"employed myself in arranging my notes. At that moment—(ought I to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"attribute it to some peculiar idiosyncrasy)—I felt so great a heat that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I was obliged to take off my coat. It was strange, for we were under","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"low latitudes; and even then the _Nautilus_, submerged as it was, ought","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to experience no change of temperature. I looked at the manometer; it","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"showed a depth of sixty feet, to which atmospheric heat could never","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"attain.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I continued my work, but the temperature rose to such a pitch as to be","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"intolerable.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Could there be fire on board?” I asked myself.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I was leaving the saloon, when Captain Nemo entered; he approached the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"thermometer, consulted it, and, turning to me, said:","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Forty-two degrees.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I have noticed it, Captain,” I replied; “and if it gets much hotter we","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cannot bear it.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Oh, sir, it will not get better if we do not wish it.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“You can reduce it as you please, then?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“No; but I can go farther from the stove which produces it.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“It is outward, then!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Certainly; we are floating in a current of boiling water.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Is it possible!” I exclaimed.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Look.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The panels opened, and I saw the sea entirely white all round. A","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sulphurous smoke was curling amid the waves, which boiled like water in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a copper. I placed my hand on one of the panes of glass, but the heat","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was so great that I quickly took it off again.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Where are we?” I asked.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Near the Island of Santorin, sir,” replied the Captain. “I wished to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"give you a sight of the curious spectacle of a submarine eruption.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I thought,” said I, “that the formation of these new islands was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ended.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Nothing is ever ended in the volcanic parts of the sea,” replied","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo; “and the globe is always being worked by subterranean","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fires. Already, in the nineteenth year of our era, according to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Cassiodorus and Pliny, a new island, Theia (the divine), appeared in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the very place where these islets have recently been formed. Then they","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sank under the waves, to rise again in the year 69, when they again","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"subsided. Since that time to our days the Plutonian work has been","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"suspended. But on the 3rd of February, 1866, a new island, which they","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"named George Island, emerged from the midst of the sulphurous vapour","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"near Nea Kamenni, and settled again the 6th of the same month. Seven","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"days after, the 13th of February, the Island of Aphroessa appeared,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"leaving between Nea Kamenni and itself a canal ten yards broad. I was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in these seas when the phenomenon occurred, and I was able therefore to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"observe all the different phases. The Island of Aphroessa, of round","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"form, measured 300 feet in diameter, and 30 feet in height. It was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"composed of black and vitreous lava, mixed with fragments of felspar.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"And lastly, on the 10th of March, a smaller island, called Reka, showed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"itself near Nea Kamenni, and since then these three have joined","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"together, forming but one and the same island.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“And the canal in which we are at this moment?” I asked.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Here it is,” replied Captain Nemo, showing me a map of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Archipelago. “You see, I have marked the new islands.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I returned to the glass. The _Nautilus_ was no longer moving, the heat","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was becoming unbearable. The sea, which till now had been white, was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"red, owing to the presence of salts of iron. In spite of the ship’s","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"being hermetically sealed, an insupportable smell of sulphur filled the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"saloon, and the brilliancy of the electricity was entirely extinguished","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"by bright scarlet flames. I was in a bath, I was choking, I was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"broiled.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“We can remain no longer in this boiling water,” said I to the Captain.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“It would not be prudent,” replied the impassive Captain Nemo.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"An order was given; the _Nautilus_ tacked about and left the furnace it","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"could not brave with impunity. A quarter of an hour after we were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"breathing fresh air on the surface. The thought then struck me that, if","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Ned Land had chosen this part of the sea for our flight, we should","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"never have come alive out of this sea of fire.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The next day, the 16th of February, we left the basin which, between","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Rhodes and Alexandria, is reckoned about 1,500 fathoms in depth, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the _Nautilus_, passing some distance from Cerigo, quitted the Grecian","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Archipelago after having doubled Cape Matapan.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"CHAPTER VII","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"THE MEDITERRANEAN IN FORTY-EIGHT HOURS","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The Mediterranean, the blue sea par excellence, “the great sea” of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Hebrews, “the sea” of the Greeks, the “mare nostrum” of the Romans,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"bordered by orange-trees, aloes, cacti, and sea-pines; embalmed with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the perfume of the myrtle, surrounded by rude mountains, saturated with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pure and transparent air, but incessantly worked by underground fires;","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a perfect battlefield in which Neptune and Pluto still dispute the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"empire of the world!","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"It is upon these banks, and on these waters, says Michelet, that man is","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"renewed in one of the most powerful climates of the globe. But,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"beautiful as it was, I could only take a rapid glance at the basin","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"whose superficial area is two million of square yards. Even Captain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Nemo’s knowledge was lost to me, for this puzzling person did not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"appear once during our passage at full speed. I estimated the course","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which the _Nautilus_ took under the waves of the sea at about six","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hundred leagues, and it was accomplished in forty-eight hours. Starting","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"on the morning of the 16th of February from the shores of Greece, we","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"had crossed the Straits of Gibraltar by sunrise on the 18th.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"It was plain to me that this Mediterranean, enclosed in the midst of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"those countries which he wished to avoid, was distasteful to Captain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Nemo. Those waves and those breezes brought back too many remembrances,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"if not too many regrets. Here he had no longer that independence and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that liberty of gait which he had when in the open seas, and his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_ felt itself cramped between the close shores of Africa and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Europe.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Our speed was now twenty-five miles an hour. It may be well understood","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that Ned Land, to his great disgust, was obliged to renounce his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"intended flight. He could not launch the pinnace, going at the rate of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"twelve or thirteen yards every second. To quit the _Nautilus_ under","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"such conditions would be as bad as jumping from a train going at full","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"speed—an imprudent thing, to say the least of it. Besides, our vessel","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"only mounted to the surface of the waves at night to renew its stock of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"air; it was steered entirely by the compass and the log.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I saw no more of the interior of this Mediterranean than a traveller by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"express train perceives of the landscape which flies before his eyes;","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that is to say, the distant horizon, and not the nearer objects which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pass like a flash of lightning.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"We were then passing between Sicily and the coast of Tunis. In the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"narrow space between Cape Bon and the Straits of Messina the bottom of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the sea rose almost suddenly. There was a perfect bank, on which there","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was not more than nine fathoms of water, whilst on either side the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"depth was ninety fathoms.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The _Nautilus_ had to manœuvre very carefully so as not to strike","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"against this submarine barrier.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I showed Conseil, on the map of the Mediterranean, the spot occupied by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"this reef.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But if you please, sir,” observed Conseil, “it is like a real isthmus","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"joining Europe to Africa.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, my boy, it forms a perfect bar to the Straits of Lybia, and the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"soundings of Smith have proved that in former times the continents","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"between Cape Boco and Cape Furina were joined.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I can well believe it,” said Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I will add,” I continued, “that a similar barrier exists between","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Gibraltar and Ceuta, which in geological times formed the entire","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Mediterranean.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“What if some volcanic burst should one day raise these two barriers","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"above the waves?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“It is not probable, Conseil.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well, but allow me to finish, please, sir; if this phenomenon should","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"take place, it will be troublesome for M. Lesseps, who has taken so","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"much pains to pierce the isthmus.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I agree with you; but I repeat, Conseil, this phenomenon will never","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"happen. The violence of subterranean force is ever diminishing.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Volcanoes, so plentiful in the first days of the world, are being","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"extinguished by degrees; the internal heat is weakened, the temperature","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the lower strata of the globe is lowered by a perceptible quantity","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"every century to the detriment of our globe, for its heat is its life.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But the sun?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“The sun is not sufficient, Conseil. Can it give heat to a dead body?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Not that I know of.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well, my friend, this earth will one day be that cold corpse; it will","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"become uninhabitable and uninhabited like the moon, which has long","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"since lost all its vital heat.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“In how many centuries?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“In some hundreds of thousands of years, my boy.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Then,” said Conseil, “we shall have time to finish our journey—that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"is, if Ned Land does not interfere with it.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"And Conseil, reassured, returned to the study of the bank, which the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_ was skirting at a moderate speed.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"During the night of the 16th and 17th February we had entered the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"second Mediterranean basin, the greatest depth of which was 1,450","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fathoms. The _Nautilus_, by the action of its crew, slid down the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"inclined planes and buried itself in the lowest depths of the sea.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"On the 18th of February, about three o’clock in the morning, we were at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the entrance of the Straits of Gibraltar. There once existed two","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"currents: an upper one, long since recognised, which conveys the waters","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the ocean into the basin of the Mediterranean; and a lower","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"counter-current, which reasoning has now shown to exist. Indeed, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"volume of water in the Mediterranean, incessantly added to by the waves","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the Atlantic and by rivers falling into it, would each year raise","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the level of this sea, for its evaporation is not sufficient to restore","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the equilibrium. As it is not so, we must necessarily admit the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"existence of an under-current, which empties into the basin of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Atlantic through the Straits of Gibraltar the surplus waters of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Mediterranean. A fact indeed; and it was this counter-current by which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the _Nautilus_ profited. It advanced rapidly by the narrow pass. For","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"one instant I caught a glimpse of the beautiful ruins of the temple of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Hercules, buried in the ground, according to Pliny, and with the low","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"island which supports it; and a few minutes later we were floating on","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the Atlantic.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"CHAPTER VIII","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"VIGO BAY","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The Atlantic! a vast sheet of water whose superficial area covers","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"twenty-five millions of square miles, the length of which is nine","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"thousand miles, with a mean breadth of two thousand seven hundred—an","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ocean whose parallel winding shores embrace an immense circumference,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"watered by the largest rivers of the world, the St. Lawrence, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Mississippi, the Amazon, the Plata, the Orinoco, the Niger, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Senegal, the Elbe, the Loire, and the Rhine, which carry water from the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"most civilised, as well as from the most savage, countries! Magnificent","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"field of water, incessantly ploughed by vessels of every nation,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sheltered by the flags of every nation, and which terminates in those","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"two terrible points so dreaded by mariners, Cape Horn and the Cape of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Tempests.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The _Nautilus_ was piercing the water with its sharp spur, after having","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"accomplished nearly ten thousand leagues in three months and a half, a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"distance greater than the great circle of the earth. Where were we","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"going now, and what was reserved for the future? The _Nautilus_,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"leaving the Straits of Gibraltar, had gone far out. It returned to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"surface of the waves, and our daily walks on the platform were restored","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to us.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I mounted at once, accompanied by Ned Land and Conseil. At a distance","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of about twelve miles, Cape St. Vincent was dimly to be seen, forming","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the south-western point of the Spanish peninsula. A strong southerly","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"gale was blowing. The sea was swollen and billowy; it made the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_ rock violently. It was almost impossible to keep one’s foot","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"on the platform, which the heavy rolls of the sea beat over every","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"instant. So we descended after inhaling some mouthfuls of fresh air.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I returned to my room, Conseil to his cabin; but the Canadian, with a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"preoccupied air, followed me. Our rapid passage across the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Mediterranean had not allowed him to put his project into execution,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and he could not help showing his disappointment. When the door of my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"room was shut, he sat down and looked at me silently.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Friend Ned,” said I, “I understand you; but you cannot reproach","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"yourself. To have attempted to leave the _Nautilus_ under the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"circumstances would have been folly.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Ned Land did not answer; his compressed lips and frowning brow showed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with him the violent possession this fixed idea had taken of his mind.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Let us see,” I continued; “we need not despair yet. We are going up","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the coast of Portugal again; France and England are not far off, where","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"we can easily find refuge. Now if the _Nautilus_, on leaving the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Straits of Gibraltar, had gone to the south, if it had carried us","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"towards regions where there were no continents, I should share your","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"uneasiness. But we know now that Captain Nemo does not fly from","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"civilised seas, and in some days I think you can act with security.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Ned Land still looked at me fixedly; at length his fixed lips parted,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and he said, “It is for to-night.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I drew myself up suddenly. I was, I admit, little prepared for this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"communication. I wanted to answer the Canadian, but words would not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"come.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“We agreed to wait for an opportunity,” continued Ned Land, “and the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"opportunity has arrived. This night we shall be but a few miles from","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the Spanish coast. It is cloudy. The wind blows freely. I have your","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"word, M. Aronnax, and I rely upon you.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"As I was silent, the Canadian approached me.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“To-night, at nine o’clock,” said he. “I have warned Conseil. At that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"moment Captain Nemo will be shut up in his room, probably in bed.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Neither the engineers nor the ship’s crew can see us. Conseil and I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"will gain the central staircase, and you, M. Aronnax, will remain in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the library, two steps from us, waiting my signal. The oars, the mast,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and the sail are in the canoe. I have even succeeded in getting some","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"provisions. I have procured an English wrench, to unfasten the bolts","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which attach it to the shell of the _Nautilus_. So all is ready, till","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to-night.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“The sea is bad.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“That I allow,” replied the Canadian; “but we must risk that. Liberty","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"is worth paying for; besides, the boat is strong, and a few miles with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a fair wind to carry us is no great thing. Who knows but by to-morrow","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"we may be a hundred leagues away? Let circumstances only favour us, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"by ten or eleven o’clock we shall have landed on some spot of terra","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"firma, alive or dead. But adieu now till to-night.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"With these words the Canadian withdrew, leaving me almost dumb. I had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"imagined that, the chance gone, I should have time to reflect and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"discuss the matter. My obstinate companion had given me no time; and,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"after all, what could I have said to him? Ned Land was perfectly right.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"There was almost the opportunity to profit by. Could I retract my word,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and take upon myself the responsibility of compromising the future of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"my companions? To-morrow Captain Nemo might take us far from all land.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At that moment a rather loud hissing noise told me that the reservoirs","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"were filling, and that the _Nautilus_ was sinking under the waves of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the Atlantic.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"A sad day I passed, between the desire of regaining my liberty of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"action and of abandoning the wonderful _Nautilus_, and leaving my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"submarine studies incomplete.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"What dreadful hours I passed thus! Sometimes seeing myself and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"companions safely landed, sometimes wishing, in spite of my reason,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that some unforeseen circumstance, would prevent the realisation of Ned","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Land’s project.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Twice I went to the saloon. I wished to consult the compass. I wished","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to see if the direction the _Nautilus_ was taking was bringing us","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"nearer or taking us farther from the coast. But no; the _Nautilus_ kept","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in Portuguese waters.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I must therefore take my part and prepare for flight. My luggage was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"not heavy; my notes, nothing more.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"As to Captain Nemo, I asked myself what he would think of our escape;","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"what trouble, what wrong it might cause him and what he might do in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"case of its discovery or failure. Certainly I had no cause to complain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of him; on the contrary, never was hospitality freer than his. In","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"leaving him I could not be taxed with ingratitude. No oath bound us to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"him. It was on the strength of circumstances he relied, and not upon","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"our word, to fix us for ever.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I had not seen the Captain since our visit to the Island of Santorin.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Would chance bring me to his presence before our departure? I wished","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"it, and I feared it at the same time. I listened if I could hear him","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"walking the room contiguous to mine. No sound reached my ear. I felt an","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"unbearable uneasiness. This day of waiting seemed eternal. Hours struck","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"too slowly to keep pace with my impatience.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"My dinner was served in my room as usual. I ate but little; I was too","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"preoccupied. I left the table at seven o’clock. A hundred and twenty","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"minutes (I counted them) still separated me from the moment in which I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was to join Ned Land. My agitation redoubled. My pulse beat violently.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I could not remain quiet. I went and came, hoping to calm my troubled","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"spirit by constant movement. The idea of failure in our bold enterprise","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was the least painful of my anxieties; but the thought of seeing our","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"project discovered before leaving the _Nautilus_, of being brought","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"before Captain Nemo, irritated, or (what was worse) saddened, at my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"desertion, made my heart beat.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I wanted to see the saloon for the last time. I descended the stairs","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and arrived in the museum, where I had passed so many useful and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"agreeable hours. I looked at all its riches, all its treasures, like a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"man on the eve of an eternal exile, who was leaving never to return.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"These wonders of Nature, these masterpieces of art, amongst which for","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"so many days my life had been concentrated, I was going to abandon them","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"for ever! I should like to have taken a last look through the windows","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the saloon into the waters of the Atlantic: but the panels were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hermetically closed, and a cloak of steel separated me from that ocean","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which I had not yet explored.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"In passing through the saloon, I came near the door let into the angle","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which opened into the Captain’s room. To my great surprise, this door","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was ajar. I drew back involuntarily. If Captain Nemo should be in his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"room, he could see me. But, hearing no sound, I drew nearer. The room","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was deserted. I pushed open the door and took some steps forward. Still","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the same monklike severity of aspect.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Suddenly the clock struck eight. The first beat of the hammer on the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"bell awoke me from my dreams. I trembled as if an invisible eye had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"plunged into my most secret thoughts, and I hurried from the room.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"There my eye fell upon the compass. Our course was still north. The log","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"indicated moderate speed, the manometer a depth of about sixty feet.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I returned to my room, clothed myself warmly—sea boots, an otterskin","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cap, a great coat of byssus, lined with sealskin; I was ready, I was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"waiting. The vibration of the screw alone broke the deep silence which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"reigned on board. I listened attentively. Would no loud voice suddenly","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"inform me that Ned Land had been surprised in his projected flight. A","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"mortal dread hung over me, and I vainly tried to regain my accustomed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"coolness.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At a few minutes to nine, I put my ear to the Captain’s door. No noise.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I left my room and returned to the saloon, which was half in obscurity,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"but deserted.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I opened the door communicating with the library. The same insufficient","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"light, the same solitude. I placed myself near the door leading to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"central staircase, and there waited for Ned Land’s signal.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At that moment the trembling of the screw sensibly diminished, then it","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"stopped entirely. The silence was now only disturbed by the beatings of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"my own heart. Suddenly a slight shock was felt; and I knew that the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_ had stopped at the bottom of the ocean. My uneasiness","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"increased. The Canadian’s signal did not come. I felt inclined to join","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Ned Land and beg of him to put off his attempt. I felt that we were not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sailing under our usual conditions.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At this moment the door of the large saloon opened, and Captain Nemo","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"appeared. He saw me, and without further preamble began in an amiable","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"tone of voice:","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Ah, sir! I have been looking for you. Do you know the history of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Spain?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Now, one might know the history of one’s own country by heart; but in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the condition I was at the time, with troubled mind and head quite","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"lost, I could not have said a word of it.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well,” continued Captain Nemo, “you heard my question! Do you know the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"history of Spain?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Very slightly,” I answered.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well, here are learned men having to learn,” said the Captain. “Come,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sit down, and I will tell you a curious episode in this history. Sir,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"listen well,” said he; “this history will interest you on one side, for","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"it will answer a question which doubtless you have not been able to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"solve.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I listen, Captain,” said I, not knowing what my interlocutor was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"driving at, and asking myself if this incident was bearing on our","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"projected flight.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Sir, if you have no objection, we will go back to 1702. You cannot be","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ignorant that your king, Louis XIV, thinking that the gesture of a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"potentate was sufficient to bring the Pyrenees under his yoke, had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"imposed the Duke of Anjou, his grandson, on the Spaniards. This prince","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"reigned more or less badly under the name of Philip V, and had a strong","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"party against him abroad. Indeed, the preceding year, the royal houses","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of Holland, Austria, and England had concluded a treaty of alliance at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the Hague, with the intention of plucking the crown of Spain from the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"head of Philip V, and placing it on that of an archduke to whom they","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"prematurely gave the title of Charles III.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Spain must resist this coalition; but she was almost entirely","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"unprovided with either soldiers or sailors. However, money would not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fail them, provided that their galleons, laden with gold and silver","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"from America, once entered their ports. And about the end of 1702 they","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"expected a rich convoy which France was escorting with a fleet of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"twenty-three vessels, commanded by Admiral Chateau-Renaud, for the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ships of the coalition were already beating the Atlantic. This convoy","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was to go to Cadiz, but the Admiral, hearing that an English fleet was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cruising in those waters, resolved to make for a French port.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“The Spanish commanders of the convoy objected to this decision. They","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"wanted to be taken to a Spanish port, and, if not to Cadiz, into Vigo","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Bay, situated on the northwest coast of Spain, and which was not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"blocked.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Admiral Chateau-Renaud had the rashness to obey this injunction, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the galleons entered Vigo Bay.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Unfortunately, it formed an open road which could not be defended in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"any way. They must therefore hasten to unload the galleons before the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"arrival of the combined fleet; and time would not have failed them had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"not a miserable question of rivalry suddenly arisen.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“You are following the chain of events?” asked Captain Nemo.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Perfectly,” said I, not knowing the end proposed by this historical","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"lesson.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I will continue. This is what passed. The merchants of Cadiz had a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"privilege by which they had the right of receiving all merchandise","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"coming from the West Indies. Now, to disembark these ingots at the port","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of Vigo was depriving them of their rights. They complained at Madrid,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and obtained the consent of the weak-minded Philip that the convoy,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"without discharging its cargo, should remain sequestered in the roads","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of Vigo until the enemy had disappeared.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But whilst coming to this decision, on the 22nd of October, 1702, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"English vessels arrived in Vigo Bay, when Admiral Chateau-Renaud, in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"spite of inferior forces, fought bravely. But, seeing that the treasure","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"must fall into the enemy’s hands, he burnt and scuttled every galleon,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which went to the bottom with their immense riches.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo stopped. I admit I could not see yet why this history","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"should interest me.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well?” I asked.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well, M. Aronnax,” replied Captain Nemo, “we are in that Vigo Bay; and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"it rests with yourself whether you will penetrate its mysteries.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The Captain rose, telling me to follow him. I had had time to recover.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I obeyed. The saloon was dark, but through the transparent glass the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"waves were sparkling. I looked.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"For half a mile around the _Nautilus_, the waters seemed bathed in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"electric light. The sandy bottom was clean and bright. Some of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ship’s crew in their diving-dresses were clearing away half-rotten","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"barrels and empty cases from the midst of the blackened wrecks. From","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"these cases and from these barrels escaped ingots of gold and silver,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cascades of piastres and jewels. The sand was heaped up with them.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Laden with their precious booty, the men returned to the _Nautilus_,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"disposed of their burden, and went back to this inexhaustible fishery","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of gold and silver.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I understood now. This was the scene of the battle of the 22nd of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"October, 1702. Here on this very spot the galleons laden for the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Spanish Government had sunk. Here Captain Nemo came, according to his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"wants, to pack up those millions with which he burdened the _Nautilus_.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"It was for him and him alone America had given up her precious metals.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"He was heir direct, without anyone to share, in those treasures torn","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"from the Incas and from the conquered of Ferdinand Cortez.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Did you know, sir,” he asked, smiling, “that the sea contained such","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"riches?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I knew,” I answered, “that they value money held in suspension in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"these waters at two millions.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Doubtless; but to extract this money the expense would be greater than","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the profit. Here, on the contrary, I have but to pick up what man has","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"lost—and not only in Vigo Bay, but in a thousand other ports where","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shipwrecks have happened, and which are marked on my submarine map. Can","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"you understand now the source of the millions I am worth?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I understand, Captain. But allow me to tell you that in exploring Vigo","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Bay you have only been beforehand with a rival society.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“And which?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“A society which has received from the Spanish Government the privilege","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of seeking those buried galleons. The shareholders are led on by the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"allurement of an enormous bounty, for they value these rich shipwrecks","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"at five hundred millions.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Five hundred millions they were,” answered Captain Nemo, “but they are","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"so no longer.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Just so,” said I; “and a warning to those shareholders would be an act","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of charity. But who knows if it would be well received? What gamblers","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"usually regret above all is less the loss of their money than of their","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"foolish hopes. After all, I pity them less than the thousands of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"unfortunates to whom so much riches well-distributed would have been","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"profitable, whilst for them they will be for ever barren.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I had no sooner expressed this regret than I felt that it must have","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"wounded Captain Nemo.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Barren!” he exclaimed, with animation. “Do you think then, sir, that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"these riches are lost because I gather them? Is it for myself alone,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"according to your idea, that I take the trouble to collect these","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"treasures? Who told you that I did not make a good use of it? Do you","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"think I am ignorant that there are suffering beings and oppressed races","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"on this earth, miserable creatures to console, victims to avenge? Do","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"you not understand?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo stopped at these last words, regretting perhaps that he","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"had spoken so much. But I had guessed that, whatever the motive which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"had forced him to seek independence under the sea, it had left him","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"still a man, that his heart still beat for the sufferings of humanity,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and that his immense charity was for oppressed races as well as","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"individuals. And I then understood for whom those millions were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"destined which were forwarded by Captain Nemo when the _Nautilus_ was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cruising in the waters of Crete.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"CHAPTER IX","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"A VANISHED CONTINENT","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The next morning, the 19th of February, I saw the Canadian enter my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"room. I expected this visit. He looked very disappointed.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well, sir?” said he.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well, Ned, fortune was against us yesterday.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes; that Captain must needs stop exactly at the hour we intended","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"leaving his vessel.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, Ned, he had business at his bankers.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“His bankers!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Or rather his banking-house; by that I mean the ocean, where his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"riches are safer than in the chests of the State.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I then related to the Canadian the incidents of the preceding night,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hoping to bring him back to the idea of not abandoning the Captain; but","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"my recital had no other result than an energetically expressed regret","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"from Ned that he had not been able to take a walk on the battlefield of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Vigo on his own account.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“However,” said he, “all is not ended. It is only a blow of the harpoon","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"lost. Another time we must succeed; and to-night, if necessary——”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“In what direction is the _Nautilus_ going?” I asked.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I do not know,” replied Ned.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well, at noon we shall see the point.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The Canadian returned to Conseil. As soon as I was dressed, I went into","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the saloon. The compass was not reassuring. The course of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_ was S.S.W. We were turning our backs on Europe.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I waited with some impatience till the ship’s place was pricked on the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"chart. At about half-past eleven the reservoirs were emptied, and our","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"vessel rose to the surface of the ocean. I rushed towards the platform.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Ned Land had preceded me. No more land in sight. Nothing but an immense","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sea. Some sails on the horizon, doubtless those going to San Roque in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"search of favourable winds for doubling the Cape of Good Hope. The","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"weather was cloudy. A gale of wind was preparing. Ned raved, and tried","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to pierce the cloudy horizon. He still hoped that behind all that fog","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"stretched the land he so longed for.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At noon the sun showed itself for an instant. The second profited by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"this brightness to take its height. Then, the sea becoming more","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"billowy, we descended, and the panel closed.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"An hour after, upon consulting the chart, I saw the position of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_ was marked at 16° 17′ long., and 33° 22′ lat., at 150","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"leagues from the nearest coast. There was no means of flight, and I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"leave you to imagine the rage of the Canadian when I informed him of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"our situation.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"For myself, I was not particularly sorry. I felt lightened of the load","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which had oppressed me, and was able to return with some degree of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"calmness to my accustomed work.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"That night, about eleven o’clock, I received a most unexpected visit","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"from Captain Nemo. He asked me very graciously if I felt fatigued from","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"my watch of the preceding night. I answered in the negative.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Then, M. Aronnax, I propose a curious excursion.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Propose, Captain?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“You have hitherto only visited the submarine depths by daylight, under","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the brightness of the sun. Would it suit you to see them in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"darkness of the night?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Most willingly.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I warn you, the way will be tiring. We shall have far to walk, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"must climb a mountain. The roads are not well kept.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“What you say, Captain, only heightens my curiosity; I am ready to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"follow you.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Come then, sir, we will put on our diving-dresses.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Arrived at the robing-room, I saw that neither of my companions nor any","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the ship’s crew were to follow us on this excursion. Captain Nemo","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"had not even proposed my taking with me either Ned or Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"In a few moments we had put on our diving-dresses; they placed on our","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"backs the reservoirs, abundantly filled with air, but no electric lamps","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"were prepared. I called the Captain’s attention to the fact.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“They will be useless,” he replied.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I thought I had not heard aright, but I could not repeat my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"observation, for the Captain’s head had already disappeared in its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"metal case. I finished harnessing myself. I felt them put an","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"iron-pointed stick into my hand, and some minutes later, after going","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"through the usual form, we set foot on the bottom of the Atlantic at a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"depth of 150 fathoms. Midnight was near. The waters were profoundly","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"dark, but Captain Nemo pointed out in the distance a reddish spot, a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sort of large light shining brilliantly about two miles from the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_. What this fire might be, what could feed it, why and how it","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"lit up the liquid mass, I could not say. In any case, it did light our","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"way, vaguely, it is true, but I soon accustomed myself to the peculiar","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"darkness, and I understood, under such circumstances, the uselessness","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the Ruhmkorff apparatus.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"As we advanced, I heard a kind of pattering above my head. The noise","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"redoubling, sometimes producing a continual shower, I soon understood","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the cause. It was rain falling violently, and crisping the surface of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the waves. Instinctively the thought flashed across my mind that I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"should be wet through! By the water! in the midst of the water! I could","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"not help laughing at the odd idea. But, indeed, in the thick","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"diving-dress, the liquid element is no longer felt, and one only seems","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to be in an atmosphere somewhat denser than the terrestrial atmosphere.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Nothing more.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"After half an hour’s walk the soil became stony. Medusae, microscopic","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"crustacea, and pennatules lit it slightly with their phosphorescent","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"gleam. I caught a glimpse of pieces of stone covered with millions of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"zoophytes and masses of sea weed. My feet often slipped upon this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sticky carpet of sea weed, and without my iron-tipped stick I should","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"have fallen more than once. In turning round, I could still see the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"whitish lantern of the _Nautilus_ beginning to pale in the distance.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"But the rosy light which guided us increased and lit up the horizon.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The presence of this fire under water puzzled me in the highest degree.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Was I going towards a natural phenomenon as yet unknown to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_savants_ of the earth? Or even (for this thought crossed my brain) had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the hand of man aught to do with this conflagration? Had he fanned this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"flame? Was I to meet in these depths companions and friends of Captain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Nemo whom he was going to visit, and who, like him, led this strange","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"existence? Should I find down there a whole colony of exiles who, weary","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the miseries of this earth, had sought and found independence in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"deep ocean? All these foolish and unreasonable ideas pursued me. And in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"this condition of mind, over-excited by the succession of wonders","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"continually passing before my eyes, I should not have been surprised to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"meet at the bottom of the sea one of those submarine towns of which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo dreamed.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Our road grew lighter and lighter. The white glimmer came in rays from","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the summit of a mountain about 800 feet high. But what I saw was simply","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a reflection, developed by the clearness of the waters. The source of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"this inexplicable light was a fire on the opposite side of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"mountain.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"In the midst of this stony maze furrowing the bottom of the Atlantic,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo advanced without hesitation. He knew this dreary road.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Doubtless he had often travelled over it, and could not lose himself. I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"followed him with unshaken confidence. He seemed to me like a genie of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the sea; and, as he walked before me, I could not help admiring his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"stature, which was outlined in black on the luminous horizon.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"It was one in the morning when we arrived at the first slopes of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"mountain; but to gain access to them we must venture through the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"difficult paths of a vast copse.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Yes; a copse of dead trees, without leaves, without sap, trees","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"petrified by the action of the water and here and there overtopped by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"gigantic pines. It was like a coal-pit still standing, holding by the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"roots to the broken soil, and whose branches, like fine black paper","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cuttings, showed distinctly on the watery ceiling. Picture to yourself","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a forest in the Hartz hanging on to the sides of the mountain, but a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"forest swallowed up. The paths were encumbered with seaweed and fucus,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"between which grovelled a whole world of crustacea. I went along,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"climbing the rocks, striding over extended trunks, breaking the sea","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"bind-weed which hung from one tree to the other; and frightening the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fishes, which flew from branch to branch. Pressing onward, I felt no","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fatigue. I followed my guide, who was never tired. What a spectacle!","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"How can I express it? how paint the aspect of those woods and rocks in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"this medium—their under parts dark and wild, the upper coloured with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"red tints, by that light which the reflecting powers of the waters","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"doubled? We climbed rocks which fell directly after with gigantic","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"bounds and the low growling of an avalanche. To right and left ran","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"long, dark galleries, where sight was lost. Here opened vast glades","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which the hand of man seemed to have worked; and I sometimes asked","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"myself if some inhabitant of these submarine regions would not suddenly","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"appear to me.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"But Captain Nemo was still mounting. I could not stay behind. I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"followed boldly. My stick gave me good help. A false step would have","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"been dangerous on the narrow passes sloping down to the sides of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"gulfs; but I walked with firm step, without feeling any giddiness. Now","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I jumped a crevice, the depth of which would have made me hesitate had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"it been among the glaciers on the land; now I ventured on the unsteady","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"trunk of a tree thrown across from one abyss to the other, without","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"looking under my feet, having only eyes to admire the wild sites of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"this region.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"There, monumental rocks, leaning on their regularly-cut bases, seemed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to defy all laws of equilibrium. From between their stony knees trees","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sprang, like a jet under heavy pressure, and upheld others which upheld","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"them. Natural towers, large scarps, cut perpendicularly, like a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“curtain,” inclined at an angle which the laws of gravitation could","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"never have tolerated in terrestrial regions.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Two hours after quitting the _Nautilus_ we had crossed the line of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"trees, and a hundred feet above our heads rose the top of the mountain,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which cast a shadow on the brilliant irradiation of the opposite slope.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Some petrified shrubs ran fantastically here and there. Fishes got up","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"under our feet like birds in the long grass. The massive rocks were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rent with impenetrable fractures, deep grottos, and unfathomable holes,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"at the bottom of which formidable creatures might be heard moving. My","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"blood curdled when I saw enormous antennae blocking my road, or some","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"frightful claw closing with a noise in the shadow of some cavity.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Millions of luminous spots shone brightly in the midst of the darkness.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"They were the eyes of giant crustacea crouched in their holes; giant","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"lobsters setting themselves up like halberdiers, and moving their claws","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with the clicking sound of pincers; titanic crabs, pointed like a gun","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"on its carriage; and frightful-looking poulps, interweaving their","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"tentacles like a living nest of serpents.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"We had now arrived on the first platform, where other surprises awaited","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"me. Before us lay some picturesque ruins, which betrayed the hand of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"man and not that of the Creator. There were vast heaps of stone,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"amongst which might be traced the vague and shadowy forms of castles","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and temples, clothed with a world of blossoming zoophytes, and over","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which, instead of ivy, sea-weed and fucus threw a thick vegetable","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"mantle. But what was this portion of the globe which had been swallowed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"by cataclysms? Who had placed those rocks and stones like cromlechs of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"prehistoric times? Where was I? Whither had Captain Nemo’s fancy","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hurried me?","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I would fain have asked him; not being able to, I stopped him—I seized","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"his arm. But, shaking his head, and pointing to the highest point of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the mountain, he seemed to say:","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Come, come along; come higher!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I followed, and in a few minutes I had climbed to the top, which for a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"circle of ten yards commanded the whole mass of rock.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I looked down the side we had just climbed. The mountain did not rise","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"more than seven or eight hundred feet above the level of the plain; but","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"on the opposite side it commanded from twice that height the depths of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"this part of the Atlantic. My eyes ranged far over a large space lit by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a violent fulguration. In fact, the mountain was a volcano.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At fifty feet above the peak, in the midst of a rain of stones and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"scoriae, a large crater was vomiting forth torrents of lava which fell","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in a cascade of fire into the bosom of the liquid mass. Thus situated,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"this volcano lit the lower plain like an immense torch, even to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"extreme limits of the horizon. I said that the submarine crater threw","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"up lava, but no flames. Flames require the oxygen of the air to feed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"upon and cannot be developed under water; but streams of lava, having","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in themselves the principles of their incandescence, can attain a white","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"heat, fight vigorously against the liquid element, and turn it to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"vapour by contact.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Rapid currents bearing all these gases in diffusion and torrents of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"lava slid to the bottom of the mountain like an eruption of Vesuvius on","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"another Terra del Greco.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"There indeed under my eyes, ruined, destroyed, lay a town—its roofs","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"open to the sky, its temples fallen, its arches dislocated, its columns","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"lying on the ground, from which one would still recognise the massive","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"character of Tuscan architecture. Further on, some remains of a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"gigantic aqueduct; here the high base of an Acropolis, with the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"floating outline of a Parthenon; there traces of a quay, as if an","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ancient port had formerly abutted on the borders of the ocean, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"disappeared with its merchant vessels and its war-galleys. Farther on","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"again, long lines of sunken walls and broad, deserted streets—a perfect","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Pompeii escaped beneath the waters. Such was the sight that Captain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Nemo brought before my eyes!","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Where was I? Where was I? I must know at any cost. I tried to speak,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"but Captain Nemo stopped me by a gesture, and, picking up a piece of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"chalk-stone, advanced to a rock of black basalt, and traced the one","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"word:","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ATLANTIS","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"What a light shot through my mind! Atlantis! the Atlantis of Plato,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that continent denied by Origen and Humbolt, who placed its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"disappearance amongst the legendary tales. I had it there now before my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"eyes, bearing upon it the unexceptionable testimony of its catastrophe.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The region thus engulfed was beyond Europe, Asia, and Lybia, beyond the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"columns of Hercules, where those powerful people, the Atlantides,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"lived, against whom the first wars of ancient Greeks were waged.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Thus, led by the strangest destiny, I was treading under foot the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"mountains of this continent, touching with my hand those ruins a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"thousand generations old and contemporary with the geological epochs. I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was walking on the very spot where the contemporaries of the first man","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"had walked.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Whilst I was trying to fix in my mind every detail of this grand","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"landscape, Captain Nemo remained motionless, as if petrified in mute","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ecstasy, leaning on a mossy stone. Was he dreaming of those generations","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"long since disappeared? Was he asking them the secret of human destiny?","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Was it here this strange man came to steep himself in historical","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"recollections, and live again this ancient life—he who wanted no modern","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"one? What would I not have given to know his thoughts, to share them,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to understand them! We remained for an hour at this place,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"contemplating the vast plains under the brightness of the lava, which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was some times wonderfully intense. Rapid tremblings ran along the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"mountain caused by internal bubblings, deep noise, distinctly","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"transmitted through the liquid medium were echoed with majestic","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"grandeur. At this moment the moon appeared through the mass of waters","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and threw her pale rays on the buried continent. It was but a gleam,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"but what an indescribable effect! The Captain rose, cast one last look","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"on the immense plain, and then bade me follow him.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"We descended the mountain rapidly, and, the mineral forest once passed,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I saw the lantern of the _Nautilus_ shining like a star. The Captain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"walked straight to it, and we got on board as the first rays of light","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"whitened the surface of the ocean.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"THE SUBMARINE COAL-MINES","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The next day, the 20th of February, I awoke very late: the fatigues of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the previous night had prolonged my sleep until eleven o’clock. I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"dressed quickly, and hastened to find the course the _Nautilus_ was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"taking. The instruments showed it to be still toward the south, with a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"speed of twenty miles an hour and a depth of fifty fathoms.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The species of fishes here did not differ much from those already","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"noticed. There were rays of giant size, five yards long, and endowed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with great muscular strength, which enabled them to shoot above the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"waves; sharks of many kinds; amongst others, one fifteen feet long,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with triangular sharp teeth, and whose transparency rendered it almost","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"invisible in the water.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Amongst bony fish Conseil noticed some about three yards long, armed at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the upper jaw with a piercing sword; other bright-coloured creatures,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"known in the time of Aristotle by the name of the sea-dragon, which are","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"dangerous to capture on account of the spikes on their back.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"About four o’clock, the soil, generally composed of a thick mud mixed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with petrified wood, changed by degrees, and it became more stony, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"seemed strewn with conglomerate and pieces of basalt, with a sprinkling","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of lava. I thought that a mountainous region was succeeding the long","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"plains; and accordingly, after a few evolutions of the _Nautilus_, I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"saw the southerly horizon blocked by a high wall which seemed to close","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"all exit. Its summit evidently passed the level of the ocean. It must","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"be a continent, or at least an island—one of the Canaries, or of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Cape Verde Islands. The bearings not being yet taken, perhaps","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"designedly, I was ignorant of our exact position. In any case, such a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"wall seemed to me to mark the limits of that Atlantis, of which we had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in reality passed over only the smallest part.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Much longer should I have remained at the window admiring the beauties","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of sea and sky, but the panels closed. At this moment the _Nautilus_","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"arrived at the side of this high, perpendicular wall. What it would do,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I could not guess. I returned to my room; it no longer moved. I laid","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"myself down with the full intention of waking after a few hours’ sleep;","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"but it was eight o’clock the next day when I entered the saloon. I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"looked at the manometer. It told me that the _Nautilus_ was floating on","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the surface of the ocean. Besides, I heard steps on the platform. I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"went to the panel. It was open; but, instead of broad daylight, as I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"expected, I was surrounded by profound darkness. Where were we? Was I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"mistaken? Was it still night? No; not a star was shining and night has","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"not that utter darkness.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"[Illustration] The _Nautilus_ was floating near a mountain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I knew not what to think, when a voice near me said:","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Is that you, Professor?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Ah! Captain,” I answered, “where are we?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Underground, sir.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Underground!” I exclaimed. “And the _Nautilus_ floating still?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“It always floats.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But I do not understand.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Wait a few minutes, our lantern will be lit, and, if you like light","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"places, you will be satisfied.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I stood on the platform and waited. The darkness was so complete that I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"could not even see Captain Nemo; but, looking to the zenith, exactly","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"above my head, I seemed to catch an undecided gleam, a kind of twilight","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"filling a circular hole. At this instant the lantern was lit, and its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"vividness dispelled the faint light. I closed my dazzled eyes for an","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"instant, and then looked again. The _Nautilus_ was stationary, floating","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"near a mountain which formed a sort of quay. The lake, then, supporting","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"it was a lake imprisoned by a circle of walls, measuring two miles in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"diameter and six in circumference. Its level (the manometer showed)","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"could only be the same as the outside level, for there must necessarily","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"be a communication between the lake and the sea. The high partitions,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"leaning forward on their base, grew into a vaulted roof bearing the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shape of an immense funnel turned upside down, the height being about","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"five or six hundred yards. At the summit was a circular orifice, by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which I had caught the slight gleam of light, evidently daylight.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Where are we?” I asked.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“In the very heart of an extinct volcano, the interior of which has","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"been invaded by the sea, after some great convulsion of the earth.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Whilst you were sleeping, Professor, the _Nautilus_ penetrated to this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"lagoon by a natural canal, which opens about ten yards beneath the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"surface of the ocean. This is its harbour of refuge, a sure,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"commodious, and mysterious one, sheltered from all gales. Show me, if","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"you can, on the coasts of any of your continents or islands, a road","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which can give such perfect refuge from all storms.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Certainly,” I replied, “you are in safety here, Captain Nemo. Who","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"could reach you in the heart of a volcano? But did I not see an opening","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"at its summit?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes; its crater, formerly filled with lava, vapour, and flames, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which now gives entrance to the life-giving air we breathe.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But what is this volcanic mountain?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“It belongs to one of the numerous islands with which this sea is","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"strewn—to vessels a simple sandbank—to us an immense cavern. Chance led","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"me to discover it, and chance served me well.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But of what use is this refuge, Captain? The _Nautilus_ wants no","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"port.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“No, sir; but it wants electricity to make it move, and the wherewithal","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to make the electricity—sodium to feed the elements, coal from which to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"get the sodium, and a coal-mine to supply the coal. And exactly on this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"spot the sea covers entire forests embedded during the geological","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"periods, now mineralised and transformed into coal; for me they are an","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"inexhaustible mine.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Your men follow the trade of miners here, then, Captain?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Exactly so. These mines extend under the waves like the mines of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Newcastle. Here, in their diving-dresses, pick axe and shovel in hand,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"my men extract the coal, which I do not even ask from the mines of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"earth. When I burn this combustible for the manufacture of sodium, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"smoke, escaping from the crater of the mountain, gives it the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"appearance of a still-active volcano.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“And we shall see your companions at work?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“No; not this time at least; for I am in a hurry to continue our","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"submarine tour of the earth. So I shall content myself with drawing","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"from the reserve of sodium I already possess. The time for loading is","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"one day only, and we continue our voyage. So, if you wish to go over","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the cavern and make the round of the lagoon, you must take advantage of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to-day, M. Aronnax.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I thanked the Captain and went to look for my companions, who had not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"yet left their cabin. I invited them to follow me without saying where","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"we were. They mounted the platform. Conseil, who was astonished at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"nothing, seemed to look upon it as quite natural that he should wake","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"under a mountain, after having fallen asleep under the waves. But Ned","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Land thought of nothing but finding whether the cavern had any exit.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"After breakfast, about ten o’clock, we went down on to the mountain.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Here we are, once more on land,” said Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I do not call this land,” said the Canadian. “And besides, we are not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"on it, but beneath it.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Between the walls of the mountains and the waters of the lake lay a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sandy shore which, at its greatest breadth, measured five hundred feet.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"On this soil one might easily make the tour of the lake. But the base","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the high partitions was stony ground, with volcanic locks and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"enormous pumice-stones lying in picturesque heaps. All these detached","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"masses, covered with enamel, polished by the action of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"subterraneous fires, shone resplendent by the light of our electric","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"lantern. The mica dust from the shore, rising under our feet, flew like","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a cloud of sparks. The bottom now rose sensibly, and we soon arrived at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"long circuitous slopes, or inclined planes, which took us higher by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"degrees; but we were obliged to walk carefully among these","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"conglomerates, bound by no cement, the feet slipping on the glassy","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"crystal, felspar, and quartz.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The volcanic nature of this enormous excavation was confirmed on all","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sides, and I pointed it out to my companions.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Picture to yourselves,” said I, “what this crater must have been when","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"filled with boiling lava, and when the level of the incandescent liquid","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rose to the orifice of the mountain, as though melted on the top of a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hot plate.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I can picture it perfectly,” said Conseil. “But, sir, will you tell me","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"why the Great Architect has suspended operations, and how it is that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the furnace is replaced by the quiet waters of the lake?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Most probably, Conseil, because some convulsion beneath the ocean","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"produced that very opening which has served as a passage for the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_. Then the waters of the Atlantic rushed into the interior of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the mountain. There must have been a terrible struggle between the two","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"elements, a struggle which ended in the victory of Neptune. But many","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ages have run out since then, and the submerged volcano is now a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"peaceable grotto.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Very well,” replied Ned Land; “I accept the explanation, sir; but, in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"our own interests, I regret that the opening of which you speak was not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"made above the level of the sea.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But, friend Ned,” said Conseil, “if the passage had not been under the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sea, the _Nautilus_ could not have gone through it.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"We continued ascending. The steps became more and more perpendicular","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and narrow. Deep excavations, which we were obliged to cross, cut them","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"here and there; sloping masses had to be turned. We slid upon our knees","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and crawled along. But Conseil’s dexterity and the Canadian’s strength","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"surmounted all obstacles. At a height of about 31 feet the nature of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the ground changed without becoming more practicable. To the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"conglomerate and trachyte succeeded black basalt, the first dispread in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"layers full of bubbles, the latter forming regular prisms, placed like","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a colonnade supporting the spring of the immense vault, an admirable","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"specimen of natural architecture. Between the blocks of basalt wound","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"long streams of lava, long since grown cold, encrusted with bituminous","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rays; and in some places there were spread large carpets of sulphur. A","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"more powerful light shone through the upper crater, shedding a vague","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"glimmer over these volcanic depressions for ever buried in the bosom of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"this extinguished mountain. But our upward march was soon stopped at a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"height of about two hundred and fifty feet by impassable obstacles.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"There was a complete vaulted arch overhanging us, and our ascent was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"changed to a circular walk. At the last change vegetable life began to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"struggle with the mineral. Some shrubs, and even some trees, grew from","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the fractures of the walls. I recognised some euphorbias, with the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"caustic sugar coming from them; heliotropes, quite incapable of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"justifying their name, sadly drooped their clusters of flowers, both","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"their colour and perfume half gone. Here and there some chrysanthemums","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"grew timidly at the foot of an aloe with long, sickly-looking leaves.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"But between the streams of lava, I saw some little violets still","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"slightly perfumed, and I admit that I smelt them with delight. Perfume","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"is the soul of the flower, and sea-flowers have no soul.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"We had arrived at the foot of some sturdy dragon-trees, which had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pushed aside the rocks with their strong roots, when Ned Land","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"exclaimed:","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Ah! sir, a hive! a hive!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“A hive!” I replied, with a gesture of incredulity.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, a hive,” repeated the Canadian, “and bees humming round it.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I approached, and was bound to believe my own eyes. There at a hole","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"bored in one of the dragon-trees were some thousands of these ingenious","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"insects, so common in all the Canaries, and whose produce is so much","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"esteemed. Naturally enough, the Canadian wished to gather the honey,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and I could not well oppose his wish. A quantity of dry leaves, mixed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with sulphur, he lit with a spark from his flint, and he began to smoke","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"out the bees. The humming ceased by degrees, and the hive eventually","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"yielded several pounds of the sweetest honey, with which Ned Land","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"filled his haversack.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“When I have mixed this honey with the paste of the bread-fruit,” said","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"he, “I shall be able to offer you a succulent cake.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"[Transcriber’s Note: ’bread-fruit’ has been substituted for","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"’artocarpus’ in this ed.]","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“’Pon my word,” said Conseil, “it will be gingerbread.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Never mind the gingerbread,” said I; “let us continue our interesting","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"walk.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At every turn of the path we were following, the lake appeared in all","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"its length and breadth. The lantern lit up the whole of its peaceable","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"surface, which knew neither ripple nor wave. The _Nautilus_ remained","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"perfectly immovable. On the platform, and on the mountain, the ship’s","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"crew were working like black shadows clearly carved against the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"luminous atmosphere. We were now going round the highest crest of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"first layers of rock which upheld the roof. I then saw that bees were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"not the only representatives of the animal kingdom in the interior of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"this volcano. Birds of prey hovered here and there in the shadows, or","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fled from their nests on the top of the rocks. There were sparrow","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hawks, with white breasts, and kestrels, and down the slopes scampered,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with their long legs, several fine fat bustards. I leave anyone to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"imagine the covetousness of the Canadian at the sight of this savoury","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"game, and whether he did not regret having no gun. But he did his best","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to replace the lead by stones, and, after several fruitless attempts,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"he succeeded in wounding a magnificent bird. To say that he risked his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"life twenty times before reaching it is but the truth; but he managed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"so well that the creature joined the honey-cakes in his bag. We were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"now obliged to descend toward the shore, the crest becoming","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"impracticable. Above us the crater seemed to gape like the mouth of a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"well. From this place the sky could be clearly seen, and clouds,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"dissipated by the west wind, leaving behind them, even on the summit of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the mountain, their misty remnants—certain proof that they were only","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"moderately high, for the volcano did not rise more than eight hundred","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"feet above the level of the ocean. Half an hour after the Canadian’s","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"last exploit we had regained the inner shore. Here the flora was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"represented by large carpets of marine crystal, a little umbelliferous","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"plant very good to pickle, which also bears the name of pierce-stone","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and sea-fennel. Conseil gathered some bundles of it. As to the fauna,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"it might be counted by thousands of crustacea of all sorts, lobsters,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"crabs, spider-crabs, chameleon shrimps, and a large number of shells,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rockfish, and limpets. Three-quarters of an hour later we had finished","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"our circuitous walk and were on board. The crew had just finished","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"loading the sodium, and the _Nautilus_ could have left that instant.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"But Captain Nemo gave no order. Did he wish to wait until night, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"leave the submarine passage secretly? Perhaps so. Whatever it might be,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the next day, the _Nautilus_, having left its port, steered clear of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"all land at a few yards beneath the waves of the Atlantic.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"CHAPTER XI","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"THE SARGASSO SEA","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"That day the _Nautilus_ crossed a singular part of the Atlantic Ocean.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"No one can be ignorant of the existence of a current of warm water","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"known by the name of the Gulf Stream. After leaving the Gulf of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Florida, we went in the direction of Spitzbergen. But before entering","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the Gulf of Mexico, about 45° of N. lat., this current divides into two","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"arms, the principal one going towards the coast of Ireland and Norway,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"whilst the second bends to the south about the height of the Azores;","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"then, touching the African shore, and describing a lengthened oval,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"returns to the Antilles. This second arm—it is rather a collar than an","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"arm—surrounds with its circles of warm water that portion of the cold,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"quiet, immovable ocean called the Sargasso Sea, a perfect lake in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"open Atlantic: it takes no less than three years for the great current","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to pass round it. Such was the region the _Nautilus_ was now visiting,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a perfect meadow, a close carpet of seaweed, fucus, and tropical","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"berries, so thick and so compact that the stem of a vessel could hardly","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"tear its way through it. And Captain Nemo, not wishing to entangle his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"screw in this herbaceous mass, kept some yards beneath the surface of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the waves. The name Sargasso comes from the Spanish word “sargazzo”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which signifies kelp. This kelp, or berry-plant, is the principal","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"formation of this immense bank. And this is the reason why these plants","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"unite in the peaceful basin of the Atlantic. The only explanation which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"can be given, he says, seems to me to result from the experience known","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to all the world. Place in a vase some fragments of cork or other","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"floating body, and give to the water in the vase a circular movement,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the scattered fragments will unite in a group in the centre of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"liquid surface, that is to say, in the part least agitated. In the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"phenomenon we are considering, the Atlantic is the vase, the Gulf","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Stream the circular current, and the Sargasso Sea the central point at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which the floating bodies unite.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I share Maury’s opinion, and I was able to study the phenomenon in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"very midst, where vessels rarely penetrate. Above us floated products","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of all kinds, heaped up among these brownish plants; trunks of trees","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"torn from the Andes or the Rocky Mountains, and floated by the Amazon","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"or the Mississippi; numerous wrecks, remains of keels, or ships’","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"bottoms, side-planks stove in, and so weighted with shells and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"barnacles that they could not again rise to the surface. And time will","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"one day justify Maury’s other opinion, that these substances thus","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"accumulated for ages will become petrified by the action of the water","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and will then form inexhaustible coal-mines—a precious reserve prepared","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"by far-seeing Nature for the moment when men shall have exhausted the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"mines of continents.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"In the midst of this inextricable mass of plants and sea weed, I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"noticed some charming pink halcyons and actiniae, with their long","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"tentacles trailing after them, and medusæ, green, red, and blue.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"All the day of the 22nd of February we passed in the Sargasso Sea,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"where such fish as are partial to marine plants find abundant","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"nourishment. The next, the ocean had returned to its accustomed aspect.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"From this time for nineteen days, from the 23rd of February to the 12th","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of March, the _Nautilus_ kept in the middle of the Atlantic, carrying","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"us at a constant speed of a hundred leagues in twenty-four hours.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo evidently intended accomplishing his submarine programme,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and I imagined that he intended, after doubling Cape Horn, to return to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the Australian seas of the Pacific. Ned Land had cause for fear. In","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"these large seas, void of islands, we could not attempt to leave the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"boat. Nor had we any means of opposing Captain Nemo’s will. Our only","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"course was to submit; but what we could neither gain by force nor","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cunning, I liked to think might be obtained by persuasion. This voyage","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ended, would he not consent to restore our liberty, under an oath never","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to reveal his existence?—an oath of honour which we should have","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"religiously kept. But we must consider that delicate question with the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain. But was I free to claim this liberty? Had he not himself said","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"from the beginning, in the firmest manner, that the secret of his life","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"exacted from him our lasting imprisonment on board the _Nautilus?_ And","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"would not my four months’ silence appear to him a tacit acceptance of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"our situation? And would not a return to the subject result in raising","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"suspicions which might be hurtful to our projects, if at some future","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"time a favourable opportunity offered to return to them?","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"During the nineteen days mentioned above, no incident of any kind","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"happened to signalise our voyage. I saw little of the Captain; he was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"at work. In the library I often found his books left open, especially","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"those on natural history. My work on submarine depths, conned over by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"him, was covered with marginal notes, often contradicting my theories","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and systems; but the Captain contented himself with thus purging my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"work; it was very rare for him to discuss it with me. Sometimes I heard","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the melancholy tones of his organ; but only at night, in the midst of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the deepest obscurity, when the _Nautilus_ slept upon the deserted","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ocean. During this part of our voyage we sailed whole days on the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"surface of the waves. The sea seemed abandoned. A few sailing-vessels,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"on the road to India, were making for the Cape of Good Hope. One day we","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"were followed by the boats of a whaler, who, no doubt, took us for some","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"enormous whale of great price; but Captain Nemo did not wish the worthy","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fellows to lose their time and trouble, so ended the chase by plunging","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"under the water. Our navigation continued until the 13th of March; that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"day the _Nautilus_ was employed in taking soundings, which greatly","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"interested me. We had then made about 13,000 leagues since our","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"departure from the high seas of the Pacific. The bearings gave us 45°","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"37′ S. lat., and 37° 53′ W. long. It was the same water in which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Denham of the Herald sounded 7,000 fathoms without finding the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"bottom. There, too, Lieutenant Parker, of the American frigate","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Congress, could not touch the bottom with 15,140 fathoms. Captain Nemo","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"intended seeking the bottom of the ocean by a diagonal sufficiently","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"lengthened by means of lateral planes placed at an angle of 45° with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the water-line of the _Nautilus_. Then the screw set to work at its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"maximum speed, its four blades beating the waves with in describable","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"force. Under this powerful pressure, the hull of the _Nautilus_","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"quivered like a sonorous chord and sank regularly under the water.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At 7,000 fathoms I saw some blackish tops rising from the midst of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"waters; but these summits might belong to high mountains like the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Himalayas or Mont Blanc, even higher; and the depth of the abyss","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"remained incalculable. The _Nautilus_ descended still lower, in spite","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the great pressure. I felt the steel plates tremble at the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fastenings of the bolts; its bars bent, its partitions groaned; the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"windows of the saloon seemed to curve under the pressure of the waters.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"And this firm structure would doubtless have yielded, if, as its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain had said, it had not been capable of resistance like a solid","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"block. We had attained a depth of 16,000 yards (four leagues), and the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sides of the _Nautilus_ then bore a pressure of 1,600 atmospheres, that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"is to say, 3,200 lbs. to each square two-fifths of an inch of its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"surface.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“What a situation to be in!” I exclaimed. “To overrun these deep","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"regions where man has never trod! Look, Captain, look at these","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"magnificent rocks, these uninhabited grottoes, these lowest receptacles","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the globe, where life is no longer possible! What unknown sights are","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"here! Why should we be unable to preserve a remembrance of them?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Would you like to carry away more than the remembrance?” said Captain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Nemo.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“What do you mean by those words?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I mean to say that nothing is easier than to make a photographic view","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of this submarine region.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I had not time to express my surprise at this new proposition, when, at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo’s call, an objective was brought into the saloon. Through","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the widely-opened panel, the liquid mass was bright with electricity,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which was distributed with such uniformity that not a shadow, not a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"gradation, was to be seen in our manufactured light. The _Nautilus_","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"remained motionless, the force of its screw subdued by the inclination","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of its planes: the instrument was propped on the bottom of the oceanic","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"site, and in a few seconds we had obtained a perfect negative.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"But, the operation being over, Captain Nemo said, “Let us go up; we","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"must not abuse our position, nor expose the _Nautilus_ too long to such","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"great pressure.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Go up again!” I exclaimed.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Hold well on.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I had not time to understand why the Captain cautioned me thus, when I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was thrown forward on to the carpet. At a signal from the Captain, its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"screw was shipped, and its blades raised vertically; the _Nautilus_","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shot into the air like a balloon, rising with stunning rapidity, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cutting the mass of waters with a sonorous agitation. Nothing was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"visible; and in four minutes it had shot through the four leagues which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"separated it from the ocean, and, after emerging like a flying-fish,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fell, making the waves rebound to an enormous height.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"CHAPTER XII","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"CACHALOTS AND WHALES","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"During the nights of the 13th and 14th of March, the _Nautilus_","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"returned to its southerly course. I fancied that, when on a level with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Cape Horn, he would turn the helm westward, in order to beat the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Pacific seas, and so complete the tour of the world. He did nothing of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the kind, but continued on his way to the southern regions. Where was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"he going to? To the pole? It was madness! I began to think that the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain’s temerity justified Ned Land’s fears. For some time past the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Canadian had not spoken to me of his projects of flight; he was less","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"communicative, almost silent. I could see that this lengthened","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"imprisonment was weighing upon him, and I felt that rage was burning","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"within him. When he met the Captain, his eyes lit up with suppressed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"anger; and I feared that his natural violence would lead him into some","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"extreme. That day, the 14th of March, Conseil and he came to me in my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"room. I inquired the cause of their visit.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“A simple question to ask you, sir,” replied the Canadian.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Speak, Ned.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“How many men are there on board the _Nautilus_, do you think?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I cannot tell, my friend.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I should say that its working does not require a large crew.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Certainly, under existing conditions, ten men, at the most, ought to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"be enough.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well, why should there be any more?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Why?” I replied, looking fixedly at Ned Land, whose meaning was easy","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to guess. “Because,” I added, “if my surmises are correct, and if I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"have well understood the Captain’s existence, the _Nautilus_ is not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"only a vessel: it is also a place of refuge for those who, like its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"commander, have broken every tie upon earth.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Perhaps so,” said Conseil; “but, in any case, the _Nautilus_ can only","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"contain a certain number of men. Could not you, sir, estimate their","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"maximum?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“How, Conseil?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“By calculation; given the size of the vessel, which you know, sir, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"consequently the quantity of air it contains, knowing also how much","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"each man expends at a breath, and comparing these results with the fact","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that the _Nautilus_ is obliged to go to the surface every twenty-four","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hours.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Conseil had not finished the sentence before I saw what he was driving","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"at.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I understand,” said I; “but that calculation, though simple enough,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"can give but a very uncertain result.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Never mind,” said Ned Land urgently.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Here it is, then,” said I. “In one hour each man consumes the oxygen","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"contained in twenty gallons of air; and in twenty-four, that contained","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in 480 gallons. We must, therefore find how many times 480 gallons of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"air the _Nautilus_ contains.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Just so,” said Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Or,” I continued, “the size of the _Nautilus_ being 1,500 tons; and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"one ton holding 200 gallons, it contains 300,000 gallons of air, which,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"divided by 480, gives a quotient of 625. Which means to say, strictly","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"speaking, that the air contained in the _Nautilus_ would suffice for","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"625 men for twenty-four hours.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Six hundred and twenty-five!” repeated Ned.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But remember that all of us, passengers, sailors, and officers","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"included, would not form a tenth part of that number.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Still too many for three men,” murmured Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The Canadian shook his head, passed his hand across his forehead, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"left the room without answering.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Will you allow me to make one observation, sir?” said Conseil. “Poor","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Ned is longing for everything that he can not have. His past life is","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"always present to him; everything that we are forbidden he regrets. His","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"head is full of old recollections. And we must understand him. What has","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"he to do here? Nothing; he is not learned like you, sir; and has not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the same taste for the beauties of the sea that we have. He would risk","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"everything to be able to go once more into a tavern in his own","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"country.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Certainly the monotony on board must seem intolerable to the Canadian,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"accustomed as he was to a life of liberty and activity. Events were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rare which could rouse him to any show of spirit; but that day an event","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"did happen which recalled the bright days of the harpooner. About","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"eleven in the morning, being on the surface of the ocean, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_ fell in with a troop of whales—an encounter which did not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"astonish me, knowing that these creatures, hunted to death, had taken","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"refuge in high latitudes.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"We were seated on the platform, with a quiet sea. The month of October","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in those latitudes gave us some lovely autumnal days. It was the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Canadian—he could not be mistaken—who signalled a whale on the eastern","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"horizon. Looking attentively, one might see its black back rise and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fall with the waves five miles from the _Nautilus_.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Ah!” exclaimed Ned Land, “if I was on board a whaler, now such a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"meeting would give me pleasure. It is one of large size. See with what","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"strength its blow-holes throw up columns of air an steam! Confound it,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"why am I bound to these steel plates?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“What, Ned,” said I, “you have not forgotten your old ideas of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fishing?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Can a whale-fisher ever forget his old trade, sir? Can he ever tire of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the emotions caused by such a chase?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“You have never fished in these seas, Ned?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Never, sir; in the northern only, and as much in Behring as in Davis","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Straits.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Then the southern whale is still unknown to you. It is the Greenland","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"whale you have hunted up to this time, and that would not risk passing","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"through the warm waters of the equator. Whales are localised, according","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to their kinds, in certain seas which they never leave. And if one of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"these creatures went from Behring to Davis Straits, it must be simply","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"because there is a passage from one sea to the other, either on the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"American or the Asiatic side.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“In that case, as I have never fished in these seas, I do not know the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"kind of whale frequenting them!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I have told you, Ned.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“A greater reason for making their acquaintance,” said Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Look! look!” exclaimed the Canadian, “they approach: they aggravate","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"me; they know that I cannot get at them!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Ned stamped his feet. His hand trembled, as he grasped an imaginary","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"harpoon.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Are these cetaceans as large as those of the northern seas?” asked he.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Very nearly, Ned.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Because I have seen large whales, sir, whales measuring a hundred","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"feet. I have even been told that those of Hullamoch and Umgallick, of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the Aleutian Islands, are sometimes a hundred and fifty feet long.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“That seems to me exaggeration. These creatures are only","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"balaeaopterons, provided with dorsal fins; and, like the cachalots, are","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"generally much smaller than the Greenland whale.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Ah!” exclaimed the Canadian, whose eyes had never left the ocean,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“they are coming nearer; they are in the same water as the _Nautilus_.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Then, returning to the conversation, he said:","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“You spoke of the cachalot as a small creature. I have heard of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"gigantic ones. They are intelligent cetacea. It is said of some that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"they cover themselves with seaweed and fucus, and then are taken for","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"islands. People encamp upon them, and settle there; lights a fire——”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“And build houses,” said Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, joker,” said Ned Land. “And one fine day the creature plunges,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"carrying with it all the inhabitants to the bottom of the sea.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Something like the travels of Sinbad the Sailor,” I replied, laughing.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Ah!” suddenly exclaimed Ned Land, “it is not one whale; there are","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ten—there are twenty—it is a whole troop! And I not able to do","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"anything! hands and feet tied!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But, friend Ned,” said Conseil, “why do you not ask Captain Nemo’s","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"permission to chase them?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Conseil had not finished his sentence when Ned Land had lowered himself","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"through the panel to seek the Captain. A few minutes afterwards the two","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"appeared together on the platform.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo watched the troop of cetacea playing on the waters about a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"mile from the _Nautilus_.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“They are southern whales,” said he; “there goes the fortune of a whole","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fleet of whalers.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well, sir,” asked the Canadian, “can I not chase them, if only to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"remind me of my old trade of harpooner?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“And to what purpose?” replied Captain Nemo; “only to destroy! We have","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"nothing to do with the whale-oil on board.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But, sir,” continued the Canadian, “in the Red Sea you allowed us to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"follow the dugong.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Then it was to procure fresh meat for my crew. Here it would be","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"killing for killing’s sake. I know that is a privilege reserved for","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"man, but I do not approve of such murderous pastime. In destroying the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"southern whale (like the Greenland whale, an inoffensive creature),","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"your traders do a culpable action, Master Land. They have already","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"depopulated the whole of Baffin’s Bay, and are annihilating a class of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"useful animals. Leave the unfortunate cetacea alone. They have plenty","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of natural enemies—cachalots, swordfish, and sawfish—without you","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"troubling them.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The Captain was right. The barbarous and inconsiderate greed of these","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fishermen will one day cause the disappearance of the last whale in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ocean. Ned Land whistled “Yankee-doodle” between his teeth, thrust his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hands into his pockets, and turned his back upon us. But Captain Nemo","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"watched the troop of cetacea, and, addressing me, said:","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I was right in saying that whales had natural enemies enough, without","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"counting man. These will have plenty to do before long. Do you see, M.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Aronnax, about eight miles to leeward, those blackish moving points?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, Captain,” I replied.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Those are cachalots—terrible animals, which I have met in troops of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"two or three hundred. As to those, they are cruel, mischievous","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"creatures; they would be right in exterminating them.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The Canadian turned quickly at the last words.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well, Captain,” said he, “it is still time, in the interest of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"whales.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“It is useless to expose one’s self, Professor. The _Nautilus_ will","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"disperse them. It is armed with a steel spur as good as Master Land’s","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"harpoon, I imagine.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The Canadian did not put himself out enough to shrug his shoulders.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Attack cetacea with blows of a spur! Who had ever heard of such a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"thing?","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Wait, M. Aronnax,” said Captain Nemo. “We will show you something you","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"have never yet seen. We have no pity for these ferocious creatures.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"They are nothing but mouth and teeth.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Mouth and teeth! No one could better describe the macrocephalous","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cachalot, which is sometimes more than seventy-five feet long. Its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"enormous head occupies one-third of its entire body. Better armed than","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the whale, whose upper jaw is furnished only with whalebone, it is","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"supplied with twenty-five large tusks, about eight inches long,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cylindrical and conical at the top, each weighing two pounds. It is in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the upper part of this enormous head, in great cavities divided by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cartilages, that is to be found from six to eight hundred pounds of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that precious oil called spermaceti. The cachalot is a disagreeable","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"creature, more tadpole than fish, according to Fredol’s description. It","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"is badly formed, the whole of its left side being (if we may say it), a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“failure,” and being only able to see with its right eye. But the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"formidable troop was nearing us. They had seen the whales and were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"preparing to attack them. One could judge beforehand that the cachalots","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"would be victorious, not only because they were better built for attack","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"than their inoffensive adversaries, but also because they could remain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"longer under water without coming to the surface. There was only just","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"time to go to the help of the whales. The _Nautilus_ went under water.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Conseil, Ned Land, and I took our places before the window in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"saloon, and Captain Nemo joined the pilot in his cage to work his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"apparatus as an engine of destruction. Soon I felt the beatings of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"screw quicken, and our speed increased. The battle between the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cachalots and the whales had already begun when the _Nautilus_ arrived.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"They did not at first show any fear at the sight of this new monster","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"joining in the conflict. But they soon had to guard against its blows.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"What a battle! The _Nautilus_ was nothing but a formidable harpoon,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"brandished by the hand of its Captain. It hurled itself against the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fleshy mass, passing through from one part to the other, leaving behind","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"it two quivering halves of the animal. It could not feel the formidable","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"blows from their tails upon its sides, nor the shock which it produced","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"itself, much more. One cachalot killed, it ran at the next, tacked on","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the spot that it might not miss its prey, going forwards and backwards,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"answering to its helm, plunging when the cetacean dived into the deep","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"waters, coming up with it when it returned to the surface, striking it","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"front or sideways, cutting or tearing in all directions and at any","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pace, piercing it with its terrible spur. What carnage! What a noise on","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the surface of the waves! What sharp hissing, and what snorting","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"peculiar to these enraged animals! In the midst of these waters,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"generally so peaceful, their tails made perfect billows. For one hour","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"this wholesale massacre continued, from which the cachalots could not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"escape. Several times ten or twelve united tried to crush the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_ by their weight. From the window we could see their enormous","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"mouths, studded with tusks, and their formidable eyes. Ned Land could","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"not contain himself; he threatened and swore at them. We could feel","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"them clinging to our vessel like dogs worrying a wild boar in a copse.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"But the _Nautilus_, working its screw, carried them here and there, or","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to the upper levels of the ocean, without caring for their enormous","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"weight, nor the powerful strain on the vessel. At length the mass of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cachalots broke up, the waves became quiet, and I felt that we were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rising to the surface. The panel opened, and we hurried on to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"platform. The sea was covered with mutilated bodies. A formidable","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"explosion could not have divided and torn this fleshy mass with more","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"violence. We were floating amid gigantic bodies, bluish on the back and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"white underneath, covered with enormous protuberances. Some terrified","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cachalots were flying towards the horizon. The waves were dyed red for","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"several miles, and the _Nautilus_ floated in a sea of blood: Captain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Nemo joined us.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well, Master Land?” said he.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well, sir,” replied the Canadian, whose enthusiasm had somewhat","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"calmed; “it is a terrible spectacle, certainly. But I am not a butcher.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I am a hunter, and I call this a butchery.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“It is a massacre of mischievous creatures,” replied the Captain; “and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the _Nautilus_ is not a butcher’s knife.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I like my harpoon better,” said the Canadian.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Every one to his own,” answered the Captain, looking fixedly at Ned","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Land.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I feared he would commit some act of violence, which would end in sad","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"consequences. But his anger was turned by the sight of a whale which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the _Nautilus_ had just come up with. The creature had not quite","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"escaped from the cachalot’s teeth. I recognised the southern whale by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"its flat head, which is entirely black. Anatomically, it is","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"distinguished from the white whale and the North Cape whale by the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"seven cervical vertebrae, and it has two more ribs than its congeners.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The unfortunate cetacean was lying on its side, riddled with holes from","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the bites, and quite dead. From its mutilated fin still hung a young","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"whale which it could not save from the massacre. Its open mouth let the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"water flow in and out, murmuring like the waves breaking on the shore.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo steered close to the corpse of the creature. Two of his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"men mounted its side, and I saw, not without surprise, that they were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"drawing from its breasts all the milk which they contained, that is to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"say, about two or three tons. The Captain offered me a cup of the milk,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which was still warm. I could not help showing my repugnance to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"drink; but he assured me that it was excellent, and not to be","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"distinguished from cow’s milk. I tasted it, and was of his opinion. It","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was a useful reserve to us, for in the shape of salt butter or cheese","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"it would form an agreeable variety from our ordinary food. From that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"day I noticed with uneasiness that Ned Land’s ill-will towards Captain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Nemo increased, and I resolved to watch the Canadian’s gestures","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"closely.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"CHAPTER XIII","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"THE ICEBERG","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The _Nautilus_ was steadily pursuing its southerly course, following","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the fiftieth meridian with considerable speed. Did he wish to reach the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pole? I did not think so, for every attempt to reach that point had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hitherto failed. Again, the season was far advanced, for in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Antarctic regions the 13th of March corresponds with the 13th of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"September of northern regions, which begin at the equinoctial season.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"On the 14th of March I saw floating ice in latitude 55°, merely pale","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"bits of debris from twenty to twenty-five feet long, forming banks over","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which the sea curled. The _Nautilus_ remained on the surface of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ocean. Ned Land, who had fished in the Arctic Seas, was familiar with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"its icebergs; but Conseil and I admired them for the first time. In the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"atmosphere towards the southern horizon stretched a white dazzling","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"band. English whalers have given it the name of “ice blink.” However","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"thick the clouds may be, it is always visible, and announces the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"presence of an ice pack or bank. Accordingly, larger blocks soon","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"appeared, whose brilliancy changed with the caprices of the fog. Some","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of these masses showed green veins, as if long undulating lines had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"been traced with sulphate of copper; others resembled enormous","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"amethysts with the light shining through them. Some reflected the light","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of day upon a thousand crystal facets. Others shaded with vivid","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"calcareous reflections resembled a perfect town of marble. The more we","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"neared the south the more these floating islands increased both in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"number and importance.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At 60° lat. every pass had disappeared. But, seeking carefully, Captain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Nemo soon found a narrow opening, through which he boldly slipped,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"knowing, however, that it would close behind him. Thus, guided by this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"clever hand, the _Nautilus_ passed through all the ice with a precision","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which quite charmed Conseil; icebergs or mountains, ice-fields or","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"smooth plains, seeming to have no limits, drift-ice or floating","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ice-packs, plains broken up, called palchs when they are circular, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"streams when they are made up of long strips. The temperature was very","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"low; the thermometer exposed to the air marked 2 deg. or 3° below zero,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"but we were warmly clad with fur, at the expense of the sea-bear and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"seal. The interior of the _Nautilus_, warmed regularly by its electric","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"apparatus, defied the most intense cold. Besides, it would only have","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"been necessary to go some yards beneath the waves to find a more","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"bearable temperature. Two months earlier we should have had perpetual","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"daylight in these latitudes; but already we had had three or four hours","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of night, and by and by there would be six months of darkness in these","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"circumpolar regions. On the 15th of March we were in the latitude of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"New Shetland and South Orkney. The Captain told me that formerly","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"numerous tribes of seals inhabited them; but that English and American","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"whalers, in their rage for destruction, massacred both old and young;","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"thus, where there was once life and animation, they had left silence","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and death.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"About eight o’clock on the morning of the 16th of March the _Nautilus_,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"following the fifty-fifth meridian, cut the Antarctic polar circle. Ice","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"surrounded us on all sides, and closed the horizon. But Captain Nemo","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"went from one opening to another, still going higher. I cannot express","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"my astonishment at the beauties of these new regions. The ice took most","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"surprising forms. Here the grouping formed an oriental town, with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"innumerable mosques and minarets; there a fallen city thrown to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"earth, as it were, by some convulsion of nature. The whole aspect was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"constantly changed by the oblique rays of the sun, or lost in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"greyish fog amidst hurricanes of snow. Detonations and falls were heard","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"on all sides, great overthrows of icebergs, which altered the whole","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"landscape like a diorama. Often seeing no exit, I thought we were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"definitely prisoners; but, instinct guiding him at the slightest","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"indication, Captain Nemo would discover a new pass. He was never","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"mistaken when he saw the thin threads of bluish water trickling along","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the ice-fields; and I had no doubt that he had already ventured into","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the midst of these Antarctic seas before. On the 16th of March,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"however, the ice-fields absolutely blocked our road. It was not the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"iceberg itself, as yet, but vast fields cemented by the cold. But this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"obstacle could not stop Captain Nemo: he hurled himself against it with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"frightful violence. The _Nautilus_ entered the brittle mass like a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"wedge, and split it with frightful crackings. It was the battering ram","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the ancients hurled by infinite strength. The ice, thrown high in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the air, fell like hail around us. By its own power of impulsion our","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"apparatus made a canal for itself; some times carried away by its own","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"impetus, it lodged on the ice-field, crushing it with its weight, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sometimes buried beneath it, dividing it by a simple pitching movement,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"producing large rents in it. Violent gales assailed us at this time,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"accompanied by thick fogs, through which, from one end of the platform","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to the other, we could see nothing. The wind blew sharply from all","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"parts of the compass, and the snow lay in such hard heaps that we had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to break it with blows of a pickaxe. The temperature was always at 5","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"deg. below zero; every outward part of the _Nautilus_ was covered with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ice. A rigged vessel would have been entangled in the blocked up","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"gorges. A vessel without sails, with electricity for its motive power,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and wanting no coal, could alone brave such high latitudes. At length,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"on the 18th of March, after many useless assaults, the _Nautilus_ was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"positively blocked. It was no longer either streams, packs, or","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ice-fields, but an interminable and immovable barrier, formed by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"mountains soldered together.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“An iceberg!” said the Canadian to me.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I knew that to Ned Land, as well as to all other navigators who had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"preceded us, this was an inevitable obstacle. The sun appearing for an","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"instant at noon, Captain Nemo took an observation as near as possible,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which gave our situation at 51° 30′ long. and 67° 39′ of S. lat. We had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"advanced one degree more in this Antarctic region. Of the liquid","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"surface of the sea there was no longer a glimpse. Under the spur of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_ lay stretched a vast plain, entangled with confused blocks.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Here and there sharp points and slender needles rising to a height of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"200 feet; further on a steep shore, hewn as it were with an axe and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"clothed with greyish tints; huge mirrors, reflecting a few rays of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sunshine, half drowned in the fog. And over this desolate face of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"nature a stern silence reigned, scarcely broken by the flapping of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"wings of petrels and puffins. Everything was frozen—even the noise. The","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_ was then obliged to stop in its adventurous course amid","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"these fields of ice. In spite of our efforts, in spite of the powerful","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"means employed to break up the ice, the _Nautilus_ remained immovable.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Generally, when we can proceed no further, we have return still open to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"us; but here return was as impossible as advance, for every pass had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"closed behind us; and for the few moments when we were stationary, we","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"were likely to be entirely blocked, which did indeed happen about two","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"o’clock in the afternoon, the fresh ice forming around its sides with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"astonishing rapidity. I was obliged to admit that Captain Nemo was more","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"than imprudent. I was on the platform at that moment. The Captain had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"been observing our situation for some time past, when he said to me:","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well, sir, what do you think of this?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I think that we are caught, Captain.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"[Illustration] The _Nautilus_ was blocked up","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“So, M. Aronnax, you really think that the _Nautilus_ cannot disengage","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"itself?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“With difficulty, Captain; for the season is already too far advanced","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"for you to reckon on the breaking of the ice.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Ah! sir,” said Captain Nemo, in an ironical tone, “you will always be","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the same. You see nothing but difficulties and obstacles. I affirm that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"not only can the _Nautilus_ disengage itself, but also that it can go","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"further still.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Further to the South?” I asked, looking at the Captain.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, sir; it shall go to the pole.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“To the pole!” I exclaimed, unable to repress a gesture of incredulity.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes,” replied the Captain, coldly, “to the Antarctic pole—to that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"unknown point from whence springs every meridian of the globe. You know","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"whether I can do as I please with the _Nautilus!_”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Yes, I knew that. I knew that this man was bold, even to rashness. But","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to conquer those obstacles which bristled round the South Pole,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rendering it more inaccessible than the North, which had not yet been","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"reached by the boldest navigators—was it not a mad enterprise, one","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which only a maniac would have conceived? It then came into my head to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ask Captain Nemo if he had ever discovered that pole which had never","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"yet been trodden by a human creature?","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“No, sir,” he replied; “but we will discover it together. Where others","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"have failed, I will not fail. I have never yet led my _Nautilus_ so far","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"into southern seas; but, I repeat, it shall go further yet.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I can well believe you, Captain,” said I, in a slightly ironical tone.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I believe you! Let us go ahead! There are no obstacles for us! Let us","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"smash this iceberg! Let us blow it up; and, if it resists, let us give","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the _Nautilus_ wings to fly over it!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Over it, sir!” said Captain Nemo, quietly; “no, not over it, but under","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"it!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Under it!” I exclaimed, a sudden idea of the Captain’s projects","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"flashing upon my mind. I understood; the wonderful qualities of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_ were going to serve us in this superhuman enterprise.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I see we are beginning to understand one another, sir,” said the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain, half smiling. “You begin to see the possibility—I should say","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the success—of this attempt. That which is impossible for an ordinary","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"vessel is easy to the _Nautilus_. If a continent lies before the pole,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"it must stop before the continent; but if, on the contrary, the pole is","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"washed by open sea, it will go even to the pole.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Certainly,” said I, carried away by the Captain’s reasoning; “if the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"surface of the sea is solidified by the ice, the lower depths are free","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"by the Providential law which has placed the maximum of density of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"waters of the ocean one degree higher than freezing-point; and, if I am","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"not mistaken, the portion of this iceberg which is above the water is","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"as one to four to that which is below.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Very nearly, sir; for one foot of iceberg above the sea there are","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"three below it. If these ice mountains are not more than 300 feet above","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the surface, they are not more than 900 beneath. And what are 900 feet","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to the _Nautilus?_”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Nothing, sir.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“It could even seek at greater depths that uniform temperature of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sea-water, and there brave with impunity the thirty or forty degrees of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"surface cold.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Just so, sir—just so,” I replied, getting animated.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“The only difficulty,” continued Captain Nemo, “is that of remaining","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"several days without renewing our provision of air.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Is that all? The _Nautilus_ has vast reservoirs; we can fill them, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"they will supply us with all the oxygen we want.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well thought of, M. Aronnax,” replied the Captain, smiling. “But, not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"wishing you to accuse me of rashness, I will first give you all my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"objections.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Have you any more to make?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Only one. It is possible, if the sea exists at the South Pole, that it","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"may be covered; and, consequently, we shall be unable to come to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"surface.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Good, sir! but do you forget that the _Nautilus_ is armed with a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"powerful spur, and could we not send it diagonally against these fields","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of ice, which would open at the shocks.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Ah! sir, you are full of ideas to-day.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Besides, Captain,” I added, enthusiastically, “why should we not find","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the sea open at the South Pole as well as at the North? The frozen","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"poles of the earth do not coincide, either in the southern or in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"northern regions; and, until it is proved to the contrary, we may","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"suppose either a continent or an ocean free from ice at these two","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"points of the globe.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I think so too, M. Aronnax,” replied Captain Nemo. “I only wish you to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"observe that, after having made so many objections to my project, you","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"are now crushing me with arguments in its favour!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The preparations for this audacious attempt now began. The powerful","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pumps of the _Nautilus_ were working air into the reservoirs and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"storing it at high pressure. About four o’clock, Captain Nemo announced","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the closing of the panels on the platform. I threw one last look at the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"massive iceberg which we were going to cross. The weather was clear,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the atmosphere pure enough, the cold very great, being 12° below zero;","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"but, the wind having gone down, this temperature was not so unbearable.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"About ten men mounted the sides of the _Nautilus_, armed with pickaxes","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to break the ice around the vessel, which was soon free. The operation","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was quickly performed, for the fresh ice was still very thin. We all","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"went below. The usual reservoirs were filled with the newly-liberated","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"water, and the _Nautilus_ soon descended. I had taken my place with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Conseil in the saloon; through the open window we could see the lower","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"beds of the Southern Ocean. The thermometer went up, the needle of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"compass deviated on the dial. At about 900 feet, as Captain Nemo had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"foreseen, we were floating beneath the undulating bottom of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"iceberg. But the _Nautilus_ went lower still—it went to the depth of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"four hundred fathoms. The temperature of the water at the surface","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"showed twelve degrees, it was now only ten; we had gained two. I need","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"not say the temperature of the _Nautilus_ was raised by its heating","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"apparatus to a much higher degree; every manœuvre was accomplished with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"wonderful precision.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“We shall pass it, if you please, sir,” said Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I believe we shall,” I said, in a tone of firm conviction.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"In this open sea, the _Nautilus_ had taken its course direct to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pole, without leaving the fifty-second meridian. From 67° 30′ to 90","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"deg., twenty-two degrees and a half of latitude remained to travel;","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that is, about five hundred leagues. The _Nautilus_ kept up a mean","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"speed of twenty-six miles an hour—the speed of an express train. If","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that was kept up, in forty hours we should reach the pole.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"For a part of the night the novelty of the situation kept us at the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"window. The sea was lit with the electric lantern; but it was deserted;","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fishes did not sojourn in these imprisoned waters; they only found","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"there a passage to take them from the Antarctic Ocean to the open polar","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sea. Our pace was rapid; we could feel it by the quivering of the long","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"steel body. About two in the morning I took some hours’ repose, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Conseil did the same. In crossing the waist I did not meet Captain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Nemo: I supposed him to be in the pilot’s cage. The next morning, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"19th of March, I took my post once more in the saloon. The electric log","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"told me that the speed of the _Nautilus_ had been slackened. It was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"then going towards the surface; but prudently emptying its reservoirs","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"very slowly. My heart beat fast. Were we going to emerge and regain the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"open polar atmosphere? No! A shock told me that the _Nautilus_ had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"struck the bottom of the iceberg, still very thick, judging from the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"deadened sound. We had in deed “struck,” to use a sea expression, but","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in an inverse sense, and at a thousand feet deep. This would give three","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"thousand feet of ice above us; one thousand being above the water-mark.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The iceberg was then higher than at its borders—not a very reassuring","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fact. Several times that day the _Nautilus_ tried again, and every time","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"it struck the wall which lay like a ceiling above it. Sometimes it met","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with but 900 yards, only 200 of which rose above the surface. It was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"twice the height it was when the _Nautilus_ had gone under the waves. I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"carefully noted the different depths, and thus obtained a submarine","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"profile of the chain as it was developed under the water. That night no","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"change had taken place in our situation. Still ice between four and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"five hundred yards in depth! It was evidently diminishing, but, still,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"what a thickness between us and the surface of the ocean! It was then","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"eight. According to the daily custom on board the _Nautilus_, its air","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"should have been renewed four hours ago; but I did not suffer much,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"although Captain Nemo had not yet made any demand upon his reserve of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"oxygen. My sleep was painful that night; hope and fear besieged me by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"turns: I rose several times. The groping of the _Nautilus_ continued.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"About three in the morning, I noticed that the lower surface of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"iceberg was only about fifty feet deep. One hundred and fifty feet now","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"separated us from the surface of the waters. The iceberg was by degrees","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"becoming an ice-field, the mountain a plain. My eyes never left the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"manometer. We were still rising diagonally to the surface, which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sparkled under the electric rays. The iceberg was stretching both above","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and beneath into lengthening slopes; mile after mile it was getting","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"thinner. At length, at six in the morning of that memorable day, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"19th of March, the door of the saloon opened, and Captain Nemo","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"appeared.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“The sea is open!!” was all he said.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"CHAPTER XIV","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"THE SOUTH POLE","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I rushed on to the platform. Yes! the open sea, with but a few","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"scattered pieces of ice and moving icebergs—a long stretch of sea; a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"world of birds in the air, and myriads of fishes under those waters,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which varied from intense blue to olive green, according to the bottom.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The thermometer marked 3° C. above zero. It was comparatively spring,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shut up as we were behind this iceberg, whose lengthened mass was dimly","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"seen on our northern horizon.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Are we at the pole?” I asked the Captain, with a beating heart.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I do not know,” he replied. “At noon I will take our bearings.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But will the sun show himself through this fog?” said I, looking at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the leaden sky.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“However little it shows, it will be enough,” replied the Captain.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"About ten miles south a solitary island rose to a height of one hundred","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and four yards. We made for it, but carefully, for the sea might be","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"strewn with banks. One hour afterwards we had reached it, two hours","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"later we had made the round of it. It measured four or five miles in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"circumference. A narrow canal separated it from a considerable stretch","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of land, perhaps a continent, for we could not see its limits. The","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"existence of this land seemed to give some colour to Maury’s theory.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The ingenious American has remarked that, between the South Pole and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the sixtieth parallel, the sea is covered with floating ice of enormous","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"size, which is never met with in the North Atlantic. From this fact he","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"has drawn the conclusion that the Antarctic Circle encloses","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"considerable continents, as icebergs cannot form in open sea, but only","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"on the coasts. According to these calculations, the mass of ice","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"surrounding the southern pole forms a vast cap, the circumference of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which must be, at least, 2,500 miles. But the _Nautilus_, for fear of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"running aground, had stopped about three cable-lengths from a strand","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"over which reared a superb heap of rocks. The boat was launched; the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain, two of his men, bearing instruments, Conseil, and myself were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in it. It was ten in the morning. I had not seen Ned Land. Doubtless","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the Canadian did not wish to admit the presence of the South Pole. A","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"few strokes of the oar brought us to the sand, where we ran ashore.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Conseil was going to jump on to the land, when I held him back.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Sir,” said I to Captain Nemo, “to you belongs the honour of first","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"setting foot on this land.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, sir,” said the Captain, “and if I do not hesitate to tread this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"South Pole, it is because, up to this time, no human being has left a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"trace there.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Saying this, he jumped lightly on to the sand. His heart beat with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"emotion. He climbed a rock, sloping to a little promontory, and there,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with his arms crossed, mute and motionless, and with an eager look, he","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"seemed to take possession of these southern regions. After five minutes","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"passed in this ecstasy, he turned to us.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“When you like, sir.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I landed, followed by Conseil, leaving the two men in the boat. For a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"long way the soil was composed of a reddish sandy stone, something like","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"crushed brick, scoriae, streams of lava, and pumice-stones. One could","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"not mistake its volcanic origin. In some parts, slight curls of smoke","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"emitted a sulphurous smell, proving that the internal fires had lost","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"nothing of their expansive powers, though, having climbed a high","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"acclivity, I could see no volcano for a radius of several miles. We","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"know that in those Antarctic countries, James Ross found two craters,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the Erebus and Terror, in full activity, on the 167th meridian,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"latitude 77° 32′. The vegetation of this desolate continent seemed to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"me much restricted. Some lichens lay upon the black rocks; some","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"microscopic plants, rudimentary diatomas, a kind of cells placed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"between two quartz shells; long purple and scarlet weed, supported on","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"little swimming bladders, which the breaking of the waves brought to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the shore. These constituted the meagre flora of this region. The shore","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was strewn with molluscs, little mussels, and limpets. I also saw","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"myriads of northern clios, one-and-a-quarter inches long, of which a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"whale would swallow a whole world at a mouthful; and some perfect","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sea-butterflies, animating the waters on the skirts of the shore.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"There appeared on the high bottoms some coral shrubs, of the kind","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which, according to James Ross, live in the Antarctic seas to the depth","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of more than 1,000 yards. Then there were little kingfishers and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"starfish studding the soil. But where life abounded most was in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"air. There thousands of birds fluttered and flew of all kinds,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"deafening us with their cries; others crowded the rock, looking at us","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"as we passed by without fear, and pressing familiarly close by our","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"feet. There were penguins, so agile in the water, heavy and awkward as","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"they are on the ground; they were uttering harsh cries, a large","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"assembly, sober in gesture, but extravagant in clamour. Albatrosses","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"passed in the air, the expanse of their wings being at least four yards","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and a half, and justly called the vultures of the ocean; some gigantic","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"petrels, and some damiers, a kind of small duck, the underpart of whose","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"body is black and white; then there were a whole series of petrels,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"some whitish, with brown-bordered wings, others blue, peculiar to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Antarctic seas, and so oily, as I told Conseil, that the inhabitants of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the Ferroe Islands had nothing to do before lighting them but to put a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"wick in.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“A little more,” said Conseil, “and they would be perfect lamps! After","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that, we cannot expect Nature to have previously furnished them with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"wicks!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"About half a mile farther on the soil was riddled with ruffs’ nests, a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sort of laying-ground, out of which many birds were issuing. Captain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Nemo had some hundreds hunted. They uttered a cry like the braying of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"an ass, were about the size of a goose, slate-colour on the body, white","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"beneath, with a yellow line round their throats; they allowed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"themselves to be killed with a stone, never trying to escape. But the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fog did not lift, and at eleven the sun had not yet shown itself. Its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"absence made me uneasy. Without it no observations were possible. How,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"then, could we decide whether we had reached the pole? When I rejoined","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo, I found him leaning on a piece of rock, silently watching","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the sky. He seemed impatient and vexed. But what was to be done? This","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rash and powerful man could not command the sun as he did the sea. Noon","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"arrived without the orb of day showing itself for an instant. We could","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"not even tell its position behind the curtain of fog; and soon the fog","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"turned to snow.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Till to-morrow,” said the Captain, quietly, and we returned to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_ amid these atmospheric disturbances.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The tempest of snow continued till the next day. It was impossible to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"remain on the platform. From the saloon, where I was taking notes of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"incidents happening during this excursion to the polar continent, I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"could hear the cries of petrels and albatrosses sporting in the midst","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of this violent storm. The _Nautilus_ did not remain motionless, but","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"skirted the coast, advancing ten miles more to the south in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"half-light left by the sun as it skirted the edge of the horizon. The","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"next day, the 20th of March, the snow had ceased. The cold was a little","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"greater, the thermometer showing 2° below zero. The fog was rising, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I hoped that that day our observations might be taken. Captain Nemo not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"having yet appeared, the boat took Conseil and myself to land. The soil","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was still of the same volcanic nature; everywhere were traces of lava,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"scoriae, and basalt; but the crater which had vomited them I could not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"see. Here, as lower down, this continent was alive with myriads of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"birds. But their rule was now divided with large troops of sea-mammals,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"looking at us with their soft eyes. There were several kinds of seals,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"some stretched on the earth, some on flakes of ice, many going in and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"out of the sea. They did not flee at our approach, never having had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"anything to do with man; and I reckoned that there were provisions","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"there for hundreds of vessels.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Sir,” said Conseil, “will you tell me the names of these creatures?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“They are seals and morses.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"It was now eight in the morning. Four hours remained to us before the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sun could be observed with advantage. I directed our steps towards a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"vast bay cut in the steep granite shore. There, I can aver that earth","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and ice were lost to sight by the numbers of sea-mammals covering them,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and I involuntarily sought for old Proteus, the mythological shepherd","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"who watched these immense flocks of Neptune. There were more seals than","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"anything else, forming distinct groups, male and female, the father","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"watching over his family, the mother suckling her little ones, some","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"already strong enough to go a few steps. When they wished to change","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"their place, they took little jumps, made by the contraction of their","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"bodies, and helped awkwardly enough by their imperfect fin, which, as","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with the lamantin, their cousins, forms a perfect forearm. I should say","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that, in the water, which is their element—the spine of these creatures","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"is flexible; with smooth and close skin and webbed feet—they swim","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"admirably. In resting on the earth they take the most graceful","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"attitudes. Thus the ancients, observing their soft and expressive","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"looks, which cannot be surpassed by the most beautiful look a woman can","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"give, their clear voluptuous eyes, their charming positions, and the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"poetry of their manners, metamorphosed them, the male into a triton and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the female into a mermaid. I made Conseil notice the considerable","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"development of the lobes of the brain in these interesting cetaceans.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"No mammal, except man, has such a quantity of brain matter; they are","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"also capable of receiving a certain amount of education, are easily","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"domesticated, and I think, with other naturalists, that if properly","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"taught they would be of great service as fishing-dogs. The greater part","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of them slept on the rocks or on the sand. Amongst these seals,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"properly so called, which have no external ears (in which they differ","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"from the otter, whose ears are prominent), I noticed several varieties","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of seals about three yards long, with a white coat, bulldog heads,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"armed with teeth in both jaws, four incisors at the top and four at the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"bottom, and two large canine teeth in the shape of a fleur-de-lis.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Amongst them glided sea-elephants, a kind of seal, with short, flexible","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"trunks. The giants of this species measured twenty feet round and ten","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"yards and a half in length; but they did not move as we approached.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“These creatures are not dangerous?” asked Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“No; not unless you attack them. When they have to defend their young","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"their rage is terrible, and it is not uncommon for them to break the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fishing-boats to pieces.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“They are quite right,” said Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I do not say they are not.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Two miles farther on we were stopped by the promontory which shelters","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the bay from the southerly winds. Beyond it we heard loud bellowings","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"such as a troop of ruminants would produce.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Good!” said Conseil; “a concert of bulls!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“No; a concert of morses.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“They are fighting!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“They are either fighting or playing.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"We now began to climb the blackish rocks, amid unforeseen stumbles, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"over stones which the ice made slippery. More than once I rolled over","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"at the expense of my loins. Conseil, more prudent or more steady, did","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"not stumble, and helped me up, saying:","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“If, sir, you would have the kindness to take wider steps, you would","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"preserve your equilibrium better.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Arrived at the upper ridge of the promontory, I saw a vast white plain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"covered with morses. They were playing amongst themselves, and what we","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"heard were bellowings of pleasure, not of anger.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"As I passed these curious animals I could examine them leisurely, for","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"they did not move. Their skins were thick and rugged, of a yellowish","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"tint, approaching to red; their hair was short and scant. Some of them","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"were four yards and a quarter long. Quieter and less timid than their","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cousins of the north, they did not, like them, place sentinels round","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the outskirts of their encampment. After examining this city of morses,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I began to think of returning. It was eleven o’clock, and, if Captain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Nemo found the conditions favourable for observations, I wished to be","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"present at the operation. We followed a narrow pathway running along","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the summit of the steep shore. At half-past eleven we had reached the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"place where we landed. The boat had run aground, bringing the Captain.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I saw him standing on a block of basalt, his instruments near him, his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"eyes fixed on the northern horizon, near which the sun was then","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"describing a lengthened curve. I took my place beside him, and waited","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"without speaking. Noon arrived, and, as before, the sun did not appear.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"It was a fatality. Observations were still wanting. If not accomplished","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to-morrow, we must give up all idea of taking any. We were indeed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"exactly at the 20th of March. To-morrow, the 21st, would be the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"equinox; the sun would disappear behind the horizon for six months, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with its disappearance the long polar night would begin. Since the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"September equinox it had emerged from the northern horizon, rising by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"lengthened spirals up to the 21st of December. At this period, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"summer solstice of the northern regions, it had begun to descend; and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to-morrow was to shed its last rays upon them. I communicated my fears","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and observations to Captain Nemo.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“You are right, M. Aronnax,” said he; “if to-morrow I cannot take the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"altitude of the sun, I shall not be able to do it for six months. But","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"precisely because chance has led me into these seas on the 21st of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"March, my bearings will be easy to take, if at twelve we can see the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sun.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Why, Captain?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Because then the orb of day described such lengthened curves that it","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"is difficult to measure exactly its height above the horizon, and grave","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"errors may be made with instruments.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“What will you do then?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I shall only use my chronometer,” replied Captain Nemo. “If to-morrow,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the 21st of March, the disc of the sun, allowing for refraction, is","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"exactly cut by the northern horizon, it will show that I am at the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"South Pole.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Just so,” said I. “But this statement is not mathematically correct,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"because the equinox does not necessarily begin at noon.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Very likely, sir; but the error will not be a hundred yards and we do","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"not want more. Till to-morrow, then!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo returned on board. Conseil and I remained to survey the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shore, observing and studying until five o’clock. Then I went to bed,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"not, however, without invoking, like the Indian, the favour of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"radiant orb. The next day, the 21st of March, at five in the morning, I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"mounted the platform. I found Captain Nemo there.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“The weather is lightening a little,” said he. “I have some hope. After","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"breakfast we will go on shore and choose a post for observation.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"That point settled, I sought Ned Land. I wanted to take him with me.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"But the obstinate Canadian refused, and I saw that his taciturnity and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"his bad humour grew day by day. After all, I was not sorry for his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"obstinacy under the circumstances. Indeed, there were too many seals on","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shore, and we ought not to lay such temptation in this unreflecting","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fisherman’s way. Breakfast over, we went on shore. The _Nautilus_ had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"gone some miles further up in the night. It was a whole league from the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"coast, above which reared a sharp peak about five hundred yards high.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The boat took with me Captain Nemo, two men of the crew, and the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"instruments, which consisted of a chronometer, a telescope, and a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"barometer. While crossing, I saw numerous whales belonging to the three","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"kinds peculiar to the southern seas; the whale, or the English “right","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"whale,” which has no dorsal fin; the “humpback,” with reeved chest and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"large, whitish fins, which, in spite of its name, do not form wings;","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and the fin-back, of a yellowish brown, the liveliest of all the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cetacea. This powerful creature is heard a long way off when he throws","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to a great height columns of air and vapour, which look like whirlwinds","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of smoke. These different mammals were disporting themselves in troops","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in the quiet waters; and I could see that this basin of the Antarctic","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Pole serves as a place of refuge to the cetacea too closely tracked by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the hunters. I also noticed large medusæ floating between the reeds.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At nine we landed; the sky was brightening, the clouds were flying to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the south, and the fog seemed to be leaving the cold surface of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"waters. Captain Nemo went towards the peak, which he doubtless meant to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"be his observatory. It was a painful ascent over the sharp lava and the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pumice-stones, in an atmosphere often impregnated with a sulphurous","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"smell from the smoking cracks. For a man unaccustomed to walk on land,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the Captain climbed the steep slopes with an agility I never saw","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"equalled and which a hunter would have envied. We were two hours","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"getting to the summit of this peak, which was half porphyry and half","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"basalt. From thence we looked upon a vast sea which, towards the north,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"distinctly traced its boundary line upon the sky. At our feet lay","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fields of dazzling whiteness. Over our heads a pale azure, free from","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fog. To the north the disc of the sun seemed like a ball of fire,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"already horned by the cutting of the horizon. From the bosom of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"water rose sheaves of liquid jets by hundreds. In the distance lay the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_ like a cetacean asleep on the water. Behind us, to the south","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and east, an immense country and a chaotic heap of rocks and ice, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"limits of which were not visible. On arriving at the summit Captain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Nemo carefully took the mean height of the barometer, for he would have","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to consider that in taking his observations. At a quarter to twelve the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sun, then seen only by refraction, looked like a golden disc shedding","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"its last rays upon this deserted continent and seas which never man had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"yet ploughed. Captain Nemo, furnished with a lenticular glass which, by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"means of a mirror, corrected the refraction, watched the orb sinking","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"below the horizon by degrees, following a lengthened diagonal. I held","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the chronometer. My heart beat fast. If the disappearance of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"half-disc of the sun coincided with twelve o’clock on the chronometer,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"we were at the pole itself.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Twelve!” I exclaimed.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“The South Pole!” replied Captain Nemo, in a grave voice, handing me","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the glass, which showed the orb cut in exactly equal parts by the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"horizon.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I looked at the last rays crowning the peak, and the shadows mounting","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"by degrees up its slopes. At that moment Captain Nemo, resting with his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hand on my shoulder, said:","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I, Captain Nemo, on this 21st day of March, 1868, have reached the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"South Pole on the ninetieth degree; and I take possession of this part","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the globe, equal to one-sixth of the known continents.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“In whose name, Captain?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“In my own, sir!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Saying which, Captain Nemo unfurled a black banner, bearing an “N” in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"gold quartered on its bunting. Then, turning towards the orb of day,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"whose last rays lapped the horizon of the sea, he exclaimed:","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Adieu, sun! Disappear, thou radiant orb! rest beneath this open sea,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and let a night of six months spread its shadows over my new domains!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"CHAPTER XV","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ACCIDENT OR INCIDENT?","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The next day, the 22nd of March, at six in the morning, preparations","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"for departure were begun. The last gleams of twilight were melting into","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"night. The cold was great, the constellations shone with wonderful","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"intensity. In the zenith glittered that wondrous Southern Cross—the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"polar bear of Antarctic regions. The thermometer showed 120 below zero,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and when the wind freshened it was most biting. Flakes of ice increased","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"on the open water. The sea seemed everywhere alike. Numerous blackish","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"patches spread on the surface, showing the formation of fresh ice.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Evidently the southern basin, frozen during the six winter months, was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"absolutely inaccessible. What became of the whales in that time?","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Doubtless they went beneath the icebergs, seeking more practicable","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"seas. As to the seals and morses, accustomed to live in a hard climate,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"they remained on these icy shores. These creatures have the instinct to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"break holes in the ice-field and to keep them open. To these holes they","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"come for breath; when the birds, driven away by the cold, have","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"emigrated to the north, these sea mammals remain sole masters of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"polar continent. But the reservoirs were filling with water, and the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_ was slowly descending. At 1,000 feet deep it stopped; its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"screw beat the waves, and it advanced straight towards the north at a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"speed of fifteen miles an hour. Towards night it was already floating","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"under the immense body of the iceberg. At three in the morning I was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"awakened by a violent shock. I sat up in my bed and listened in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"darkness, when I was thrown into the middle of the room. The","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_, after having struck, had rebounded violently. I groped","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"along the partition, and by the staircase to the saloon, which was lit","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"by the luminous ceiling. The furniture was upset. Fortunately the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"windows were firmly set, and had held fast. The pictures on the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"starboard side, from being no longer vertical, were clinging to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"paper, whilst those of the port side were hanging at least a foot from","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the wall. The _Nautilus_ was lying on its starboard side perfectly","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"motionless. I heard footsteps, and a confusion of voices; but Captain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Nemo did not appear. As I was leaving the saloon, Ned Land and Conseil","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"entered.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“What is the matter?” said I, at once.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I came to ask you, sir,” replied Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Confound it!” exclaimed the Canadian, “I know well enough! The","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_ has struck; and, judging by the way she lies, I do not think","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"she will right herself as she did the first time in Torres Straits.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But,” I asked, “has she at least come to the surface of the sea?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“We do not know,” said Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“It is easy to decide,” I answered. I consulted the manometer. To my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"great surprise, it showed a depth of more than 180 fathoms. “What does","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that mean?” I exclaimed.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“We must ask Captain Nemo,” said Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But where shall we find him?” said Ned Land.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Follow me,” said I, to my companions.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"We left the saloon. There was no one in the library. At the centre","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"staircase, by the berths of the ship’s crew, there was no one. I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"thought that Captain Nemo must be in the pilot’s cage. It was best to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"wait. We all returned to the saloon. For twenty minutes we remained","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"thus, trying to hear the slightest noise which might be made on board","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the _Nautilus_, when Captain Nemo entered. He seemed not to see us; his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"face, generally so impassive, showed signs of uneasiness. He watched","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the compass silently, then the manometer; and, going to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"planisphere, placed his finger on a spot representing the southern","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"seas. I would not interrupt him; but, some minutes later, when he","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"turned towards me, I said, using one of his own expressions in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Torres Straits:","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“An incident, Captain?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“No, sir; an accident this time.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Serious?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Perhaps.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Is the danger immediate?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“No.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“The _Nautilus_ has stranded?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“And this has happened—how?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“From a caprice of nature, not from the ignorance of man. Not a mistake","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"has been made in the working. But we cannot prevent equilibrium from","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"producing its effects. We may brave human laws, but we cannot resist","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"natural ones.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo had chosen a strange moment for uttering this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"philosophical reflection. On the whole, his answer helped me little.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“May I ask, sir, the cause of this accident?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“An enormous block of ice, a whole mountain, has turned over,” he","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"replied. “When icebergs are undermined at their base by warmer water or","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"reiterated shocks their centre of gravity rises, and the whole thing","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"turns over. This is what has happened; one of these blocks, as it fell,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"struck the _Nautilus_, then, gliding under its hull, raised it with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"irresistible force, bringing it into beds which are not so thick, where","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"it is lying on its side.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But can we not get the _Nautilus_ off by emptying its reservoirs, that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"it might regain its equilibrium?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“That, sir, is being done at this moment. You can hear the pump","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"working. Look at the needle of the manometer; it shows that the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_ is rising, but the block of ice is floating with it; and,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"until some obstacle stops its ascending motion, our position cannot be","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"altered.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Indeed, the _Nautilus_ still held the same position to starboard;","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"doubtless it would right itself when the block stopped. But at this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"moment who knows if we may not be frightfully crushed between the two","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"glassy surfaces? I reflected on all the consequences of our position.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo never took his eyes off the manometer. Since the fall of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the iceberg, the _Nautilus_ had risen about a hundred and fifty feet,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"but it still made the same angle with the perpendicular. Suddenly a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"slight movement was felt in the hold. Evidently it was righting a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"little. Things hanging in the saloon were sensibly returning to their","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"normal position. The partitions were nearing the upright. No one spoke.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"With beating hearts we watched and felt the straightening. The boards","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"became horizontal under our feet. Ten minutes passed.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“At last we have righted!” I exclaimed.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes,” said Captain Nemo, going to the door of the saloon.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But are we floating?” I asked.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Certainly,” he replied; “since the reservoirs are not empty; and, when","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"empty, the _Nautilus_ must rise to the surface of the sea.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"We were in open sea; but at a distance of about ten yards, on either","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"side of the _Nautilus_, rose a dazzling wall of ice. Above and beneath","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the same wall. Above, because the lower surface of the iceberg","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"stretched over us like an immense ceiling. Beneath, because the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"overturned block, having slid by degrees, had found a resting-place on","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the lateral walls, which kept it in that position. The _Nautilus_ was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"really imprisoned in a perfect tunnel of ice more than twenty yards in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"breadth, filled with quiet water. It was easy to get out of it by going","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"either forward or backward, and then make a free passage under the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"iceberg, some hundreds of yards deeper. The luminous ceiling had been","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"extinguished, but the saloon was still resplendent with intense light.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"It was the powerful reflection from the glass partition sent violently","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"back to the sheets of the lantern. I cannot describe the effect of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"voltaic rays upon the great blocks so capriciously cut; upon every","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"angle, every ridge, every facet was thrown a different light, according","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to the nature of the veins running through the ice; a dazzling mine of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"gems, particularly of sapphires, their blue rays crossing with the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"green of the emerald. Here and there were opal shades of wonderful","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"softness, running through bright spots like diamonds of fire, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"brilliancy of which the eye could not bear. The power of the lantern","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"seemed increased a hundredfold, like a lamp through the lenticular","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"plates of a first-class lighthouse.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“How beautiful! how beautiful!” cried Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes,” I said, “it is a wonderful sight. Is it not, Ned?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, confound it! Yes,” answered Ned Land, “it is superb! I am mad at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"being obliged to admit it. No one has ever seen anything like it; but","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the sight may cost us dear. And, if I must say all, I think we are","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"seeing here things which God never intended man to see.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Ned was right, it was too beautiful. Suddenly a cry from Conseil made","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"me turn.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“What is it?” I asked.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Shut your eyes, sir! Do not look, sir!” Saying which, Conseil clapped","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"his hands over his eyes.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But what is the matter, my boy?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I am dazzled, blinded.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"My eyes turned involuntarily towards the glass, but I could not stand","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the fire which seemed to devour them. I understood what had happened.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The _Nautilus_ had put on full speed. All the quiet lustre of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ice-walls was at once changed into flashes of lightning. The fire from","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"these myriads of diamonds was blinding. It required some time to calm","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"our troubled looks. At last the hands were taken down.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Faith, I should never have believed it,” said Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"It was then five in the morning; and at that moment a shock was felt at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the bows of the _Nautilus_. I knew that its spur had struck a block of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ice. It must have been a false manœuvre, for this submarine tunnel,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"obstructed by blocks, was not very easy navigation. I thought that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo, by changing his course, would either turn these obstacles","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"or else follow the windings of the tunnel. In any case, the road before","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"us could not be entirely blocked. But, contrary to my expectations, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_ took a decided retrograde motion.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“We are going backwards?” said Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes,” I replied. “This end of the tunnel can have no egress.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“And then?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Then,” said I, “the working is easy. We must go back again, and go out","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"at the southern opening. That is all.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"In speaking thus, I wished to appear more confident than I really was.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"But the retrograde motion of the _Nautilus_ was increasing; and,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"reversing the screw, it carried us at great speed.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“It will be a hindrance,” said Ned.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“What does it matter, some hours more or less, provided we get out at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"last?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes,” repeated Ned Land, “provided we do get out at last!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"For a short time I walked from the saloon to the library. My companions","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"were silent. I soon threw myself on an ottoman, and took a book, which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"my eyes overran mechanically. A quarter of an hour after, Conseil,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"approaching me, said, “Is what you are reading very interesting, sir?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Very interesting!” I replied.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I should think so, sir. It is your own book you are reading.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“My book?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"And indeed I was holding in my hand the work on the Great Submarine","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Depths. I did not even dream of it. I closed the book and returned to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"my walk. Ned and Conseil rose to go.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Stay here, my friends,” said I, detaining them. “Let us remain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"together until we are out of this block.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“As you please, sir,” Conseil replied.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Some hours passed. I often looked at the instruments hanging from the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"partition. The manometer showed that the _Nautilus_ kept at a constant","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"depth of more than three hundred yards; the compass still pointed to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"south; the log indicated a speed of twenty miles an hour, which, in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"such a cramped space, was very great. But Captain Nemo knew that he","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"could not hasten too much, and that minutes were worth ages to us. At","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"twenty-five minutes past eight a second shock took place, this time","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"from behind. I turned pale. My companions were close by my side. I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"seized Conseil’s hand. Our looks expressed our feelings better than","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"words. At this moment the Captain entered the saloon. I went up to him.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Our course is barred southward?” I asked.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, sir. The iceberg has shifted and closed every outlet.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“We are blocked up then?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"CHAPTER XVI","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"WANT OF AIR","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Thus around the _Nautilus_, above and below, was an impenetrable wall","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of ice. We were prisoners to the iceberg. I watched the Captain. His","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"countenance had resumed its habitual imperturbability.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Gentlemen,” he said calmly, “there are two ways of dying in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"circumstances in which we are placed.” (This puzzling person had the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"air of a mathematical professor lecturing to his pupils.) “The first is","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to be crushed; the second is to die of suffocation. I do not speak of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the possibility of dying of hunger, for the supply of provisions in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_ will certainly last longer than we shall. Let us, then,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"calculate our chances.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“As to suffocation, Captain,” I replied, “that is not to be feared,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"because our reservoirs are full.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Just so; but they will only yield two days’ supply of air. Now, for","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"thirty-six hours we have been hidden under the water, and already the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"heavy atmosphere of the _Nautilus_ requires renewal. In forty-eight","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hours our reserve will be exhausted.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well, Captain, can we be delivered before forty-eight hours?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“We will attempt it, at least, by piercing the wall that surrounds us.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“On which side?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Sound will tell us. I am going to run the _Nautilus_ aground on the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"lower bank, and my men will attack the iceberg on the side that is","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"least thick.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo went out. Soon I discovered by a hissing noise that the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"water was entering the reservoirs. The _Nautilus_ sank slowly, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rested on the ice at a depth of 350 yards, the depth at which the lower","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"bank was immersed.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“My friends,” I said, “our situation is serious, but I rely on your","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"courage and energy.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Sir,” replied the Canadian, “I am ready to do anything for the general","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"safety.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Good! Ned,” and I held out my hand to the Canadian.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I will add,” he continued, “that, being as handy with the pickaxe as","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with the harpoon, if I can be useful to the Captain, he can command my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"services.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“He will not refuse your help. Come, Ned!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I led him to the room where the crew of the _Nautilus_ were putting on","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"their cork-jackets. I told the Captain of Ned’s proposal, which he","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"accepted. The Canadian put on his sea-costume, and was ready as soon as","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"his companions. When Ned was dressed, I re-entered the drawing-room,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"where the panes of glass were open, and, posted near Conseil, I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"examined the ambient beds that supported the _Nautilus_. Some instants","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"after, we saw a dozen of the crew set foot on the bank of ice, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"among them Ned Land, easily known by his stature. Captain Nemo was with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"them. Before proceeding to dig the walls, he took the soundings, to be","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sure of working in the right direction. Long sounding lines were sunk","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in the side walls, but after fifteen yards they were again stopped by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the thick wall. It was useless to attack it on the ceiling-like","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"surface, since the iceberg itself measured more than 400 yards in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"height. Captain Nemo then sounded the lower surface. There ten yards of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"wall separated us from the water, so great was the thickness of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ice-field. It was necessary, therefore, to cut from it a piece equal in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"extent to the waterline of the _Nautilus_. There were about 6,000 cubic","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"yards to detach, so as to dig a hole by which we could descend to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ice-field. The work had begun immediately and carried on with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"indefatigable energy. Instead of digging round the _Nautilus_ which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"would have involved greater difficulty, Captain Nemo had an immense","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"trench made at eight yards from the port-quarter. Then the men set to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"work simultaneously with their screws on several points of its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"circumference. Presently the pickaxe attacked this compact matter","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"vigorously, and large blocks were detached from the mass. By a curious","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"effect of specific gravity, these blocks, lighter than water, fled, so","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to speak, to the vault of the tunnel, that increased in thickness at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the top in proportion as it diminished at the base. But that mattered","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"little, so long as the lower part grew thinner. After two hours’ hard","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"work, Ned Land came in exhausted. He and his comrades were replaced by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"new workers, whom Conseil and I joined. The second lieutenant of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_ superintended us. The water seemed singularly cold, but I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"soon got warm handling the pickaxe. My movements were free enough,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"although they were made under a pressure of thirty atmospheres. When I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"re-entered, after working two hours, to take some food and rest, I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"found a perceptible difference between the pure fluid with which the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Rouquayrol engine supplied me and the atmosphere of the _Nautilus_,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"already charged with carbonic acid. The air had not been renewed for","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"forty-eight hours, and its vivifying qualities were considerably","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"enfeebled. However, after a lapse of twelve hours, we had only raised a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"block of ice one yard thick, on the marked surface, which was about 600","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cubic yards! Reckoning that it took twelve hours to accomplish this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"much it would take five nights and four days to bring this enterprise","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to a satisfactory conclusion. Five nights and four days! And we have","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"only air enough for two days in the reservoirs! “Without taking into","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"account,” said Ned, “that, even if we get out of this infernal prison,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"we shall also be imprisoned under the iceberg, shut out from all","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"possible communication with the atmosphere.” True enough! Who could","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"then foresee the minimum of time necessary for our deliverance? We","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"might be suffocated before the _Nautilus_ could regain the surface of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the waves? Was it destined to perish in this ice-tomb, with all those","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"it enclosed? The situation was terrible. But everyone had looked the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"danger in the face, and each was determined to do his duty to the last.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"As I expected, during the night a new block a yard square was carried","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"away, and still further sank the immense hollow. But in the morning","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"when, dressed in my cork-jacket, I traversed the slushy mass at a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"temperature of six or seven degrees below zero, I remarked that the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"side walls were gradually closing in. The beds of water farthest from","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the trench, that were not warmed by the men’s work, showed a tendency","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to solidification. In presence of this new and imminent danger, what","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"would become of our chances of safety, and how hinder the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"solidification of this liquid medium, that would burst the partitions","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the _Nautilus_ like glass?","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I did not tell my companions of this new danger. What was the good of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"damping the energy they displayed in the painful work of escape? But","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"when I went on board again, I told Captain Nemo of this grave","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"complication.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I know it,” he said, in that calm tone which could counteract the most","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"terrible apprehensions. “It is one danger more; but I see no way of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"escaping it; the only chance of safety is to go quicker than","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"solidification. We must be beforehand with it, that is all.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"On this day for several hours I used my pickaxe vigorously. The work","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"kept me up. Besides, to work was to quit the _Nautilus_, and breathe","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"directly the pure air drawn from the reservoirs, and supplied by our","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"apparatus, and to quit the impoverished and vitiated atmosphere.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Towards evening the trench was dug one yard deeper. When I returned on","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"board, I was nearly suffocated by the carbonic acid with which the air","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was filled—ah! if we had only the chemical means to drive away this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"deleterious gas. We had plenty of oxygen; all this water contained a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"considerable quantity, and by dissolving it with our powerful piles, it","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"would restore the vivifying fluid. I had thought well over it; but of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"what good was that, since the carbonic acid produced by our respiration","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"had invaded every part of the vessel? To absorb it, it was necessary to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fill some jars with caustic potash, and to shake them incessantly. Now","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"this substance was wanting on board, and nothing could replace it. On","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that evening, Captain Nemo ought to open the taps of his reservoirs,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and let some pure air into the interior of the _Nautilus;_ without this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"precaution we could not get rid of the sense of suffocation. The next","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"day, March 26th, I resumed my miner’s work in beginning the fifth yard.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The side walls and the lower surface of the iceberg thickened visibly.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"It was evident that they would meet before the _Nautilus_ was able to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"disengage itself. Despair seized me for an instant; my pickaxe nearly","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fell from my hands. What was the good of digging if I must be","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"suffocated, crushed by the water that was turning into stone?—a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"punishment that the ferocity of the savages even would not have","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"invented! Just then Captain Nemo passed near me. I touched his hand and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"showed him the walls of our prison. The wall to port had advanced to at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"least four yards from the hull of the _Nautilus_. The Captain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"understood me, and signed me to follow him. We went on board. I took","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"off my cork-jacket and accompanied him into the drawing-room.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“M. Aronnax, we must attempt some desperate means, or we shall be","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sealed up in this solidified water as in cement.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes; but what is to be done?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Ah! if my _Nautilus_ were strong enough to bear this pressure without","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"being crushed!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well?” I asked, not catching the Captain’s idea.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Do you not understand,” he replied, “that this congelation of water","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"will help us? Do you not see that by its solidification, it would burst","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"through this field of ice that imprisons us, as, when it freezes, it","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"bursts the hardest stones? Do you not perceive that it would be an","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"agent of safety instead of destruction?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, Captain, perhaps. But, whatever resistance to crushing the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_ possesses, it could not support this terrible pressure, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"would be flattened like an iron plate.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I know it, sir. Therefore we must not reckon on the aid of nature, but","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"on our own exertions. We must stop this solidification. Not only will","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the side walls be pressed together; but there is not ten feet of water","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"before or behind the _Nautilus_. The congelation gains on us on all","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sides.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“How long will the air in the reservoirs last for us to breathe on","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"board?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The Captain looked in my face. “After to-morrow they will be empty!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"A cold sweat came over me. However, ought I to have been astonished at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the answer? On March 22, the _Nautilus_ was in the open polar seas. We","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"were at 26°. For five days we had lived on the reserve on board. And","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"what was left of the respirable air must be kept for the workers. Even","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"now, as I write, my recollection is still so vivid that an involuntary","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"terror seizes me and my lungs seem to be without air. Meanwhile,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo reflected silently, and evidently an idea had struck him;","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"but he seemed to reject it. At last, these words escaped his lips:","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Boiling water!” he muttered.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Boiling water?” I cried.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, sir. We are enclosed in a space that is relatively confined.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Would not jets of boiling water, constantly injected by the pumps,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"raise the temperature in this part and stay the congelation?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Let us try it,” I said resolutely.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Let us try it, Professor.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The thermometer then stood at 7° outside. Captain Nemo took me to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"galleys, where the vast distillatory machines stood that furnished the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"drinkable water by evaporation. They filled these with water, and all","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the electric heat from the piles was thrown through the worms bathed in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the liquid. In a few minutes this water reached 100°. It was directed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"towards the pumps, while fresh water replaced it in proportion. The","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"heat developed by the troughs was such that cold water, drawn up from","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the sea after only having gone through the machines, came boiling into","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the body of the pump. The injection was begun, and three hours after","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the thermometer marked 6° below zero outside. One degree was gained.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Two hours later the thermometer only marked 4°.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“We shall succeed,” I said to the Captain, after having anxiously","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"watched the result of the operation.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I think,” he answered, “that we shall not be crushed. We have no more","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"suffocation to fear.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"During the night the temperature of the water rose to 1° below zero.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The injections could not carry it to a higher point. But, as the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"congelation of the sea-water produces at least 2°, I was at least","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"reassured against the dangers of solidification.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The next day, March 27th, six yards of ice had been cleared, twelve","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"feet only remaining to be cleared away. There was yet forty-eight","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hours’ work. The air could not be renewed in the interior of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_. And this day would make it worse. An intolerable weight","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"oppressed me. Towards three o’clock in the evening this feeling rose to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a violent degree. Yawns dislocated my jaws. My lungs panted as they","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"inhaled this burning fluid, which became rarefied more and more. A","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"moral torpor took hold of me. I was powerless, almost unconscious. My","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"brave Conseil, though exhibiting the same symptoms and suffering in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"same manner, never left me. He took my hand and encouraged me, and I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"heard him murmur, “Oh! if I could only not breathe, so as to leave more","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"air for my master!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Tears came into my eyes on hearing him speak thus. If our situation to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"all was intolerable in the interior, with what haste and gladness would","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"we put on our cork-jackets to work in our turn! Pickaxes sounded on the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"frozen ice-beds. Our arms ached, the skin was torn off our hands. But","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"what were these fatigues, what did the wounds matter? Vital air came to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the lungs! We breathed! we breathed!","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"All this time no one prolonged his voluntary task beyond the prescribed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"time. His task accomplished, each one handed in turn to his panting","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"companions the apparatus that supplied him with life. Captain Nemo set","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the example, and submitted first to this severe discipline. When the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"time came, he gave up his apparatus to another and returned to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"vitiated air on board, calm, unflinching, unmurmuring.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"On that day the ordinary work was accomplished with unusual vigour.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Only two yards remained to be raised from the surface. Two yards only","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"separated us from the open sea. But the reservoirs were nearly emptied","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of air. The little that remained ought to be kept for the workers; not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a particle for the _Nautilus_. When I went back on board, I was half","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"suffocated. What a night! I know not how to describe it. The next day","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"my breathing was oppressed. Dizziness accompanied the pain in my head","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and made me like a drunken man. My companions showed the same symptoms.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Some of the crew had rattling in the throat.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"On that day, the sixth of our imprisonment, Captain Nemo, finding the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pickaxes work too slowly, resolved to crush the ice-bed that still","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"separated us from the liquid sheet. This man’s coolness and energy","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"never forsook him. He subdued his physical pains by moral force.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"By his orders the vessel was lightened, that is to say, raised from the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ice-bed by a change of specific gravity. When it floated they towed it","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"so as to bring it above the immense trench made on the level of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"water-line. Then, filling his reservoirs of water, he descended and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shut himself up in the hole.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Just then all the crew came on board, and the double door of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"communication was shut. The _Nautilus_ then rested on the bed of ice,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which was not one yard thick, and which the sounding leads had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"perforated in a thousand places. The taps of the reservoirs were then","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"opened, and a hundred cubic yards of water was let in, increasing the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"weight of the _Nautilus_ to 1,800 tons. We waited, we listened,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"forgetting our sufferings in hope. Our safety depended on this last","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"chance. Notwithstanding the buzzing in my head, I soon heard the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"humming sound under the hull of the _Nautilus_. The ice cracked with a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"singular noise, like tearing paper, and the _Nautilus_ sank.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“We are off!” murmured Conseil in my ear.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I could not answer him. I seized his hand, and pressed it convulsively.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"All at once, carried away by its frightful overcharge, the _Nautilus_","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sank like a bullet under the waters, that is to say, it fell as if it","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was in a vacuum. Then all the electric force was put on the pumps, that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"soon began to let the water out of the reservoirs. After some minutes,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"our fall was stopped. Soon, too, the manometer indicated an ascending","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"movement. The screw, going at full speed, made the iron hull tremble to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"its very bolts and drew us towards the north. But if this floating","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"under the iceberg is to last another day before we reach the open sea,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I shall be dead first.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Half stretched upon a divan in the library, I was suffocating. My face","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was purple, my lips blue, my faculties suspended. I neither saw nor","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"heard. All notion of time had gone from my mind. My muscles could not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"contract. I do not know how many hours passed thus, but I was conscious","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the agony that was coming over me. I felt as if I was going to die.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Suddenly I came to. Some breaths of air penetrated my lungs. Had we","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"risen to the surface of the waves? Were we free of the iceberg? No! Ned","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and Conseil, my two brave friends, were sacrificing themselves to save","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"me. Some particles of air still remained at the bottom of one","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"apparatus. Instead of using it, they had kept it for me, and, while","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"they were being suffocated, they gave me life, drop by drop. I wanted","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to push back the thing; they held my hands, and for some moments I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"breathed freely. I looked at the clock; it was eleven in the morning.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"It ought to be the 28th of March. The _Nautilus_ went at a frightful","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pace, forty miles an hour. It literally tore through the water. Where","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was Captain Nemo? Had he succumbed? Were his companions dead with him?","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At the moment the manometer indicated that we were not more than twenty","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"feet from the surface. A mere plate of ice separated us from the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"atmosphere. Could we not break it? Perhaps. In any case the _Nautilus_","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was going to attempt it. I felt that it was in an oblique position,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"lowering the stern, and raising the bows. The introduction of water had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"been the means of disturbing its equilibrium. Then, impelled by its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"powerful screw, it attacked the ice-field from beneath like a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"formidable battering-ram. It broke it by backing and then rushing","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"forward against the field, which gradually gave way; and at last,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"dashing suddenly against it, shot forwards on the ice-field, that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"crushed beneath its weight. The panel was opened—one might say torn","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"off—and the pure air came in in abundance to all parts of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"CHAPTER XVII","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"FROM CAPE HORN TO THE AMAZON","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"How I got on to the platform, I have no idea; perhaps the Canadian had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"carried me there. But I breathed, I inhaled the vivifying sea-air. My","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"two companions were getting drunk with the fresh particles. The other","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"unhappy men had been so long without food, that they could not with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"impunity indulge in the simplest aliments that were given them. We, on","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the contrary, had no end to restrain ourselves; we could draw this air","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"freely into our lungs, and it was the breeze, the breeze alone, that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"filled us with this keen enjoyment.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Ah!” said Conseil, “how delightful this oxygen is! Master need not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fear to breathe it. There is enough for everybody.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Ned Land did not speak, but he opened his jaws wide enough to frighten","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a shark. Our strength soon returned, and, when I looked round me, I saw","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"we were alone on the platform. The foreign seamen in the _Nautilus_","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"were contented with the air that circulated in the interior; none of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"them had come to drink in the open air.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The first words I spoke were words of gratitude and thankfulness to my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"two companions. Ned and Conseil had prolonged my life during the last","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hours of this long agony. All my gratitude could not repay such","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"devotion.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“My friends,” said I, “we are bound one to the other for ever, and I am","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"under infinite obligations to you.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Which I shall take advantage of,” exclaimed the Canadian.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“What do you mean?” said Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I mean that I shall take you with me when I leave this infernal","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well,” said Conseil, “after all this, are we going right?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes,” I replied, “for we are going the way of the sun, and here the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sun is in the north.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“No doubt,” said Ned Land; “but it remains to be seen whether he will","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"bring the ship into the Pacific or the Atlantic Ocean, that is, into","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"frequented or deserted seas.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I could not answer that question, and I feared that Captain Nemo would","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rather take us to the vast ocean that touches the coasts of Asia and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"America at the same time. He would thus complete the tour round the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"submarine world, and return to those waters in which the _Nautilus_","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"could sail freely. We ought, before long, to settle this important","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"point. The _Nautilus_ went at a rapid pace. The polar circle was soon","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"passed, and the course shaped for Cape Horn. We were off the American","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"point, March 31st, at seven o’clock in the evening. Then all our past","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sufferings were forgotten. The remembrance of that imprisonment in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ice was effaced from our minds. We only thought of the future. Captain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Nemo did not appear again either in the drawing-room or on the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"platform. The point shown each day on the planisphere, and, marked by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the lieutenant, showed me the exact direction of the _Nautilus_. Now,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"on that evening, it was evident, to, my great satisfaction, that we","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"were going back to the North by the Atlantic. The next day, April 1st,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"when the _Nautilus_ ascended to the surface some minutes before noon,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"we sighted land to the west. It was Terra del Fuego, which the first","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"navigators named thus from seeing the quantity of smoke that rose from","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the natives’ huts. The coast seemed low to me, but in the distance rose","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"high mountains. I even thought I had a glimpse of Mount Sarmiento, that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rises 2,070 yards above the level of the sea, with a very pointed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"summit, which, according as it is misty or clear, is a sign of fine or","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of wet weather. At this moment the peak was clearly defined against the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sky. The _Nautilus_, diving again under the water, approached the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"coast, which was only some few miles off. From the glass windows in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"drawing-room, I saw long seaweeds and gigantic fuci and varech, of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which the open polar sea contains so many specimens, with their sharp","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"polished filaments; they measured about 300 yards in length—real","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cables, thicker than one’s thumb; and, having great tenacity, they are","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"often used as ropes for vessels. Another weed known as velp, with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"leaves four feet long, buried in the coral concretions, hung at the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"bottom. It served as nest and food for myriads of crustacea and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"molluscs, crabs, and cuttlefish. There seals and otters had splendid","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"repasts, eating the flesh of fish with sea-vegetables, according to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"English fashion. Over this fertile and luxuriant ground the _Nautilus_","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"passed with great rapidity. Towards evening it approached the Falkland","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"group, the rough summits of which I recognised the following day. The","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"depth of the sea was moderate. On the shores our nets brought in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"beautiful specimens of sea weed, and particularly a certain fucus, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"roots of which were filled with the best mussels in the world. Geese","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and ducks fell by dozens on the platform, and soon took their places in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the pantry on board.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"When the last heights of the Falklands had disappeared from the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"horizon, the _Nautilus_ sank to between twenty and twenty-five yards,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and followed the American coast. Captain Nemo did not show himself.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Until the 3rd of April we did not quit the shores of Patagonia,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sometimes under the ocean, sometimes at the surface. The _Nautilus_","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"passed beyond the large estuary formed by the Uraguay. Its direction","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was northwards, and followed the long windings of the coast of South","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"America. We had then made 1,600 miles since our embarkation in the seas","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of Japan. About eleven o’clock in the morning the Tropic of Capricorn","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was crossed on the thirty-seventh meridian, and we passed Cape Frio","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"standing out to sea. Captain Nemo, to Ned Land’s great displeasure, did","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"not like the neighbourhood of the inhabited coasts of Brazil, for we","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"went at a giddy speed. Not a fish, not a bird of the swiftest kind","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"could follow us, and the natural curiosities of these seas escaped all","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"observation.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"This speed was kept up for several days, and in the evening of the 9th","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of April we sighted the most westerly point of South America that forms","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Cape San Roque. But then the _Nautilus_ swerved again, and sought the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"lowest depth of a submarine valley which is between this Cape and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Sierra Leone on the African coast. This valley bifurcates to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"parallel of the Antilles, and terminates at the mouth by the enormous","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"depression of 9,000 yards. In this place, the geological basin of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ocean forms, as far as the Lesser Antilles, a cliff to three and a half","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"miles perpendicular in height, and, at the parallel of the Cape Verde","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Islands, an other wall not less considerable, that encloses thus all","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the sunk continent of the Atlantic. The bottom of this immense valley","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"is dotted with some mountains, that give to these submarine places a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"picturesque aspect. I speak, moreover, from the manuscript charts that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"were in the library of the _Nautilus_—charts evidently due to Captain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Nemo’s hand, and made after his personal observations. For two days the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"desert and deep waters were visited by means of the inclined planes.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The _Nautilus_ was furnished with long diagonal broadsides which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"carried it to all elevations. But on the 11th of April it rose","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"suddenly, and land appeared at the mouth of the Amazon River, a vast","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"estuary, the embouchure of which is so considerable that it freshens","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the sea-water for the distance of several leagues.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The equator was crossed. Twenty miles to the west were the Guianas, a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"French territory, on which we could have found an easy refuge; but a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"stiff breeze was blowing, and the furious waves would not have allowed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a single boat to face them. Ned Land understood that, no doubt, for he","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"spoke not a word about it. For my part, I made no allusion to his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"schemes of flight, for I would not urge him to make an attempt that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"must inevitably fail. I made the time pass pleasantly by interesting","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"studies. During the days of April 11th and 12th, the _Nautilus_ did not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"leave the surface of the sea, and the net brought in a marvellous haul","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of Zoophytes, fish and reptiles. Some zoophytes had been fished up by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the chain of the nets; they were for the most part beautiful","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"phyctallines, belonging to the actinidian family, and among other","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"species the phyctalis protexta, peculiar to that part of the ocean,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with a little cylindrical trunk, ornamented With vertical lines,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"speckled with red dots, crowning a marvellous blossoming of tentacles.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"As to the molluscs, they consisted of some I had already","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"observed—turritellas, olive porphyras, with regular lines intercrossed,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with red spots standing out plainly against the flesh; odd pteroceras,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"like petrified scorpions; translucid hyaleas, argonauts, cuttle-fish","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"(excellent eating), and certain species of calmars that naturalists of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"antiquity have classed amongst the flying-fish, and that serve","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"principally for bait for cod-fishing. I had now an opportunity of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"studying several species of fish on these shores. Amongst the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cartilaginous ones, petromyzons-pricka, a sort of eel, fifteen inches","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"long, with a greenish head, violet fins, grey-blue back, brown belly,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"silvered and sown with bright spots, the pupil of the eye encircled","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with gold—a curious animal, that the current of the Amazon had drawn to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the sea, for they inhabit fresh waters—tuberculated streaks, with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pointed snouts, and a long loose tail, armed with a long jagged sting;","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"little sharks, a yard long, grey and whitish skin, and several rows of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"teeth, bent back, that are generally known by the name of pantouffles;","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"vespertilios, a kind of red isosceles triangle, half a yard long, to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which pectorals are attached by fleshy prolongations that make them","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"look like bats, but that their horny appendage, situated near the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"nostrils, has given them the name of sea-unicorns; lastly, some species","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of balistae, the curassavian, whose spots were of a brilliant gold","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"colour, and the capriscus of clear violet, and with varying shades like","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a pigeon’s throat.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I end here this catalogue, which is somewhat dry perhaps, but very","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"exact, with a series of bony fish that I observed in passing belonging","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to the apteronotes, and whose snout is white as snow, the body of a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"beautiful black, marked with a very long loose fleshy strip;","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"odontognathes, armed with spikes; sardines nine inches long, glittering","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with a bright silver light; a species of mackerel provided with two","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"anal fins; centronotes of a blackish tint, that are fished for with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"torches, long fish, two yards in length, with fat flesh, white and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"firm, which, when they arc fresh, taste like eel, and when dry, like","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"smoked salmon; labres, half red, covered with scales only at the bottom","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the dorsal and anal fins; chrysoptera, on which gold and silver","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"blend their brightness with that of the ruby and topaz; golden-tailed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"spares, the flesh of which is extremely delicate, and whose","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"phosphorescent properties betray them in the midst of the waters;","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"orange-coloured spares with long tongues; maigres, with gold caudal","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fins, dark thorn-tails, anableps of Surinam, etc.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Notwithstanding this “et cetera,” I must not omit to mention fish that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Conseil will long remember, and with good reason. One of our nets had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hauled up a sort of very flat ray fish, which, with the tail cut off,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"formed a perfect disc, and weighed twenty ounces. It was white","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"underneath, red above, with large round spots of dark blue encircled","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with black, very glossy skin, terminating in a bilobed fin. Laid out on","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the platform, it struggled, tried to turn itself by convulsive","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"movements, and made so many efforts, that one last turn had nearly sent","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"it into the sea. But Conseil, not wishing to let the fish go, rushed to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"it, and, before I could prevent him, had seized it with both hands. In","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a moment he was overthrown, his legs in the air, and half his body","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"paralysed, crying—","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Oh! master, master! help me!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"It was the first time the poor boy had spoken to me so familiarly. The","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Canadian and I took him up, and rubbed his contracted arms till he","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"became sensible. The unfortunate Conseil had attacked a cramp-fish of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the most dangerous kind, the cumana. This odd animal, in a medium","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"conductor like water, strikes fish at several yards’ distance, so great","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"is the power of its electric organ, the two principal surfaces of which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"do not measure less than twenty-seven square feet. The next day, April","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"12th, the _Nautilus_ approached the Dutch coast, near the mouth of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Maroni. There several groups of sea-cows herded together; they were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"manatees, that, like the dugong and the stellera, belong to the skenian","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"order. These beautiful animals, peaceable and inoffensive, from","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"eighteen to twenty-one feet in length, weigh at least sixteen","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hundredweight. I told Ned Land and Conseil that provident nature had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"assigned an important role to these mammalia. Indeed, they, like the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"seals, are designed to graze on the submarine prairies, and thus","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"destroy the accumulation of weed that obstructs the tropical rivers.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“And do you know,” I added, “what has been the result since men have","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"almost entirely annihilated this useful race? That the putrefied weeds","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"have poisoned the air, and the poisoned air causes the yellow fever,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that desolates these beautiful countries. Enormous vegetations are","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"multiplied under the torrid seas, and the evil is irresistibly","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"developed from the mouth of the Rio de la Plata to Florida. If we are","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to believe Toussenel, this plague is nothing to what it would be if the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"seas were cleaned of whales and seals. Then, infested with poulps,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"medusæ, and cuttle-fish, they would become immense centres of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"infection, since their waves would not possess ‘these vast stomachs","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that God had charged to infest the surface of the seas.’”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"CHAPTER XVIII","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"THE POULPS","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"For several days the _Nautilus_ kept off from the American coast.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Evidently it did not wish to risk the tides of the Gulf of Mexico or of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the sea of the Antilles. April 16th, we sighted Martinique and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Guadaloupe from a distance of about thirty miles. I saw their tall","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"peaks for an instant. The Canadian, who counted on carrying out his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"projects in the Gulf, by either landing or hailing one of the numerous","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"boats that coast from one island to another, was quite disheartened.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Flight would have been quite practicable, if Ned Land had been able to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"take possession of the boat without the Captain’s knowledge. But in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"open sea it could not be thought of. The Canadian, Conseil, and I had a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"long conversation on this subject. For six months we had been prisoners","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"on board the _Nautilus_. We had travelled 17,000 leagues; and, as Ned","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Land said, there was no reason why it should come to an end. We could","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hope nothing from the Captain of the _Nautilus_, but only from","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ourselves. Besides, for some time past he had become graver, more","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"retired, less sociable. He seemed to shun me. I met him rarely.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Formerly he was pleased to explain the submarine marvels to me; now he","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"left me to my studies, and came no more to the saloon. What change had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"come over him? For what cause? For my part, I did not wish to bury with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"me my curious and novel studies. I had now the power to write the true","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"book of the sea; and this book, sooner or later, I wished to see","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"daylight. The land nearest us was the archipelago of the Bahamas. There","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rose high submarine cliffs covered with large weeds. It was about","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"eleven o’clock when Ned Land drew my attention to a formidable","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pricking, like the sting of an ant, which was produced by means of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"large seaweeds.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well,” I said, “these are proper caverns for poulps, and I should not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"be astonished to see some of these monsters.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“What!” said Conseil; “cuttlefish, real cuttlefish of the cephalopod","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"class?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“No,” I said, “poulps of huge dimensions.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I will never believe that such animals exist,” said Ned.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well,” said Conseil, with the most serious air in the world, “I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"remember perfectly to have seen a large vessel drawn under the waves by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"an octopus’s arm.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“You saw that?” said the Canadian.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, Ned.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“With your own eyes?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“With my own eyes.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Where, pray, might that be?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“At St. Malo,” answered Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“In the port?” said Ned, ironically.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“No; in a church,” replied Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“In a church!” cried the Canadian.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes; friend Ned. In a picture representing the poulp in question.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Good!” said Ned Land, bursting out laughing.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“He is quite right,” I said. “I have heard of this picture; but the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"subject represented is taken from a legend, and you know what to think","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of legends in the matter of natural history. Besides, when it is a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"question of monsters, the imagination is apt to run wild. Not only is","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"it supposed that these poulps can draw down vessels, but a certain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Olaus Magnus speaks of an octopus a mile long that is more like an","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"island than an animal. It is also said that the Bishop of Nidros was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"building an altar on an immense rock. Mass finished, the rock began to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"walk, and returned to the sea. The rock was a poulp. Another Bishop,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Pontoppidan, speaks also of a poulp on which a regiment of cavalry","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"could manœuvre. Lastly, the ancient naturalists speak of monsters whose","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"mouths were like gulfs, and which were too large to pass through the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Straits of Gibraltar.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But how much is true of these stories?” asked Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Nothing, my friends; at least of that which passes the limit of truth","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to get to fable or legend. Nevertheless, there must be some ground for","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the imagination of the story-tellers. One cannot deny that poulps and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cuttlefish exist of a large species, inferior, however, to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cetaceans. Aristotle has stated the dimensions of a cuttlefish as five","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cubits, or nine feet two inches. Our fishermen frequently see some that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"are more than four feet long. Some skeletons of poulps are preserved in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the museums of Trieste and Montpelier, that measure two yards in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"length. Besides, according to the calculations of some naturalists, one","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of these animals only six feet long would have tentacles twenty-seven","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"feet long. That would suffice to make a formidable monster.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Do they fish for them in these days?” asked Ned.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“If they do not fish for them, sailors see them at least. One of my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"friends, Captain Paul Bos of Havre, has often affirmed that he met one","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of these monsters of colossal dimensions in the Indian seas. But the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"most astonishing fact, and which does not permit of the denial of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"existence of these gigantic animals, happened some years ago, in 1861.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“What is the fact?” asked Ned Land.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“This is it. In 1861, to the north-east of Teneriffe, very nearly in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the same latitude we are in now, the crew of the despatch-boat Alector","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"perceived a monstrous cuttlefish swimming in the waters. Captain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Bouguer went near to the animal, and attacked it with harpoon and guns,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"without much success, for balls and harpoons glided over the soft","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"flesh. After several fruitless attempts the crew tried to pass a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"slip-knot round the body of the mollusc. The noose slipped as far as","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the tail fins and there stopped. They tried then to haul it on board,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"but its weight was so considerable that the tightness of the cord","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"separated the tail from the body, and, deprived of this ornament, he","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"disappeared under the water.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Indeed! is that a fact?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“An indisputable fact, my good Ned. They proposed to name this poulp","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"‘Bouguer’s cuttlefish.’”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“What length was it?” asked the Canadian.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Did it not measure about six yards?” said Conseil, who, posted at the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"window, was examining again the irregular windings of the cliff.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Precisely,” I replied.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Its head,” rejoined Conseil, “was it not crowned with eight tentacles,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that beat the water like a nest of serpents?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Precisely.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Had not its eyes, placed at the back of its head, considerable","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"development?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, Conseil.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“And was not its mouth like a parrot’s beak?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Exactly, Conseil.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Very well! no offence to master,” he replied, quietly; “if this is not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Bouguer’s cuttlefish, it is, at least, one of its brothers.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I looked at Conseil. Ned Land hurried to the window.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“What a horrible beast!” he cried.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I looked in my turn, and could not repress a gesture of disgust. Before","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"my eyes was a horrible monster worthy to figure in the legends of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"marvellous. It was an immense cuttlefish, being eight yards long. It","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"swam crossways in the direction of the _Nautilus_ with great speed,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"watching us with its enormous staring green eyes. Its eight arms, or","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rather feet, fixed to its head, that have given the name of cephalopod","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to these animals, were twice as long as its body, and were twisted like","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the furies’ hair. One could see the 250 air holes on the inner side of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the tentacles. The monster’s mouth, a horned beak like a parrot’s,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"opened and shut vertically. Its tongue, a horned substance, furnished","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with several rows of pointed teeth, came out quivering from this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"veritable pair of shears. What a freak of nature, a bird’s beak on a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"mollusc! Its spindle-like body formed a fleshy mass that might weigh","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"4,000 to 5,000 lbs.; the, varying colour changing with great rapidity,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"according to the irritation of the animal, passed successively from","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"livid grey to reddish brown. What irritated this mollusc? No doubt the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"presence of the _Nautilus_, more formidable than itself, and on which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"its suckers or its jaws had no hold. Yet, what monsters these poulps","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"are! what vitality the Creator has given them! what vigour in their","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"movements! and they possess three hearts! Chance had brought us in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"presence of this cuttlefish, and I did not wish to lose the opportunity","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of carefully studying this specimen of cephalopods. I overcame the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"horror that inspired me, and, taking a pencil, began to draw it.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Perhaps this is the same which the Alector saw,” said Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“No,” replied the Canadian; “for this is whole, and the other had lost","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"its tail.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“That is no reason,” I replied. “The arms and tails of these animals","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"are re-formed by renewal; and in seven years the tail of Bouguer’s","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cuttlefish has no doubt had time to grow.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"By this time other poulps appeared at the port light. I counted seven.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"They formed a procession after the _Nautilus_, and I heard their beaks","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"gnashing against the iron hull. I continued my work. These monsters","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"kept in the water with such precision that they seemed immovable.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Suddenly the _Nautilus_ stopped. A shock made it tremble in every","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"plate.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Have we struck anything?” I asked.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“In any case,” replied the Canadian, “we shall be free, for we are","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"floating.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The _Nautilus_ was floating, no doubt, but it did not move. A minute","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"passed. Captain Nemo, followed by his lieutenant, entered the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"drawing-room. I had not seen him for some time. He seemed dull. Without","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"noticing or speaking to us, he went to the panel, looked at the poulps,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and said something to his lieutenant. The latter went out. Soon the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"panels were shut. The ceiling was lighted. I went towards the Captain.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“A curious collection of poulps?” I said.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, indeed, Mr. Naturalist,” he replied; “and we are going to fight","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"them, man to beast.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I looked at him. I thought I had not heard aright.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Man to beast?” I repeated.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, sir. The screw is stopped. I think that the horny jaws of one of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the cuttlefish is entangled in the blades. That is what prevents our","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"moving.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“What are you going to do?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Rise to the surface, and slaughter this vermin.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“A difficult enterprise.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, indeed. The electric bullets are powerless against the soft","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"flesh, where they do not find resistance enough to go off. But we shall","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"attack them with the hatchet.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“And the harpoon, sir,” said the Canadian, “if you do not refuse my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"help.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I will accept it, Master Land.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“We will follow you,” I said, and, following Captain Nemo, we went","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"towards the central staircase.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"There, about ten men with boarding-hatchets were ready for the attack.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Conseil and I took two hatchets; Ned Land seized a harpoon. The","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_ had then risen to the surface. One of the sailors, posted on","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the top ladderstep, unscrewed the bolts of the panels. But hardly were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the screws loosed, when the panel rose with great violence, evidently","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"drawn by the suckers of a poulp’s arm. Immediately one of these arms","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"slid like a serpent down the opening and twenty others were above. With","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"one blow of the axe, Captain Nemo cut this formidable tentacle, that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"slid wriggling down the ladder. Just as we were pressing one on the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"other to reach the platform, two other arms, lashing the air, came down","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"on the seaman placed before Captain Nemo, and lifted him up with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"irresistible power. Captain Nemo uttered a cry, and rushed out. We","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hurried after him.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"[Illustration] One of these long arms glided through the opening","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"What a scene! The unhappy man, seized by the tentacle and fixed to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"suckers, was balanced in the air at the caprice of this enormous trunk.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"He rattled in his throat, he was stifled, he cried, “Help! help!” These","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"words, spoken in French, startled me! I had a fellow-countryman on","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"board, perhaps several! That heart-rending cry! I shall hear it all my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"life. The unfortunate man was lost. Who could rescue him from that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"powerful pressure? However, Captain Nemo had rushed to the poulp, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with one blow of the axe had cut through one arm. His lieutenant","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"struggled furiously against other monsters that crept on the flanks of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the _Nautilus_. The crew fought with their axes. The Canadian, Conseil,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and I buried our weapons in the fleshy masses; a strong smell of musk","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"penetrated the atmosphere. It was horrible!","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"For one instant, I thought the unhappy man, entangled with the poulp,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"would be torn from its powerful suction. Seven of the eight arms had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"been cut off. One only wriggled in the air, brandishing the victim like","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a feather. But just as Captain Nemo and his lieutenant threw themselves","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"on it, the animal ejected a stream of black liquid. We were blinded","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with it. When the cloud dispersed, the cuttlefish had disappeared, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"my unfortunate countryman with it. Ten or twelve poulps now invaded the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"platform and sides of the _Nautilus_. We rolled pell-mell into the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"midst of this nest of serpents, that wriggled on the platform in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"waves of blood and ink. It seemed as though these slimy tentacles","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sprang up like the hydra’s heads. Ned Land’s harpoon, at each stroke,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was plunged into the staring eyes of the cuttle fish. But my bold","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"companion was suddenly overturned by the tentacles of a monster he had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"not been able to avoid.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Ah! how my heart beat with emotion and horror! The formidable beak of a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cuttlefish was open over Ned Land. The unhappy man would be cut in two.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I rushed to his succour. But Captain Nemo was before me; his axe","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"disappeared between the two enormous jaws, and, miraculously saved, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Canadian, rising, plunged his harpoon deep into the triple heart of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"poulp.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I owed myself this revenge!” said the Captain to the Canadian.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Ned bowed without replying. The combat had lasted a quarter of an hour.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The monsters, vanquished and mutilated, left us at last, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"disappeared under the waves. Captain Nemo, covered with blood, nearly","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"exhausted, gazed upon the sea that had swallowed up one of his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"companions, and great tears gathered in his eyes.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"CHAPTER XIX","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"THE GULF STREAM","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"This terrible scene of the 20th of April none of us can ever forget. I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"have written it under the influence of violent emotion. Since then I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"have revised the recital; I have read it to Conseil and to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Canadian. They found it exact as to facts, but insufficient as to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"effect. To paint such pictures, one must have the pen of the most","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"illustrious of our poets, the author of The Toilers of the Deep.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I have said that Captain Nemo wept while watching the waves; his grief","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was great. It was the second companion he had lost since our arrival on","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"board, and what a death! That friend, crushed, stifled, bruised by the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"dreadful arms of a poulp, pounded by his iron jaws, would not rest with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"his comrades in the peaceful coral cemetery! In the midst of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"struggle, it was the despairing cry uttered by the unfortunate man that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"had torn my heart. The poor Frenchman, forgetting his conventional","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"language, had taken to his own mother tongue, to utter a last appeal!","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Amongst the crew of the _Nautilus_, associated with the body and soul","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the Captain, recoiling like him from all contact with men, I had a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fellow-countryman. Did he alone represent France in this mysterious","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"association, evidently composed of individuals of divers nationalities?","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"It was one of these insoluble problems that rose up unceasingly before","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"my mind!","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo entered his room, and I saw him no more for some time. But","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that he was sad and irresolute I could see by the vessel, of which he","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was the soul, and which received all his impressions. The _Nautilus_","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"did not keep on in its settled course; it floated about like a corpse","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"at the will of the waves. It went at random. He could not tear himself","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"away from the scene of the last struggle, from this sea that had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"devoured one of his men. Ten days passed thus. It was not till the 1st","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of May that the _Nautilus_ resumed its northerly course, after having","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sighted the Bahamas at the mouth of the Bahama Canal. We were then","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"following the current from the largest river to the sea, that has its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"banks, its fish, and its proper temperatures. I mean the Gulf Stream.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"It is really a river, that flows freely to the middle of the Atlantic,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and whose waters do not mix with the ocean waters. It is a salt river,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"salter than the surrounding sea. Its mean depth is 1,500 fathoms, its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"mean breadth ten miles. In certain places the current flows with the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"speed of two miles and a half an hour. The body of its waters is more","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"considerable than that of all the rivers in the globe. It was on this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ocean river that the _Nautilus_ then sailed.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I must add that, during the night, the phosphorescent waters of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Gulf Stream rivalled the electric power of our watch-light, especially","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in the stormy weather that threatened us so frequently. May 8th, we","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"were still crossing Cape Hatteras, at the height of the North Caroline.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The width of the Gulf Stream there is seventy-five miles, and its depth","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"210 yards. The _Nautilus_ still went at random; all supervision seemed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"abandoned. I thought that, under these circumstances, escape would be","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"possible. Indeed, the inhabited shores offered anywhere an easy refuge.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The sea was incessantly ploughed by the steamers that ply between New","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"York or Boston and the Gulf of Mexico, and overrun day and night by the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"little schooners coasting about the several parts of the American","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"coast. We could hope to be picked up. It was a favourable opportunity,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"notwithstanding the thirty miles that separated the _Nautilus_ from the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"coasts of the Union. One unfortunate circumstance thwarted the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Canadian’s plans. The weather was very bad. We were nearing those","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shores where tempests are so frequent, that country of waterspouts and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cyclones actually engendered by the current of the Gulf Stream. To","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"tempt the sea in a frail boat was certain destruction. Ned Land owned","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"this himself. He fretted, seized with nostalgia that flight only could","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cure.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Master,” he said that day to me, “this must come to an end. I must","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"make a clean breast of it. This Nemo is leaving land and going up to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the north. But I declare to you that I have had enough of the South","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Pole, and I will not follow him to the North.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“What is to be done, Ned, since flight is impracticable just now?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“We must speak to the Captain,” said he; “you said nothing when we were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in your native seas. I will speak, now we are in mine. When I think","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that before long the _Nautilus_ will be by Nova Scotia, and that there","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"near New foundland is a large bay, and into that bay the St. Lawrence","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"empties itself, and that the St. Lawrence is my river, the river by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Quebec, my native town—when I think of this, I feel furious, it makes","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"my hair stand on end. Sir, I would rather throw myself into the sea! I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"will not stay here! I am stifled!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The Canadian was evidently losing all patience. His vigorous nature","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"could not stand this prolonged imprisonment. His face altered daily;","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"his temper became more surly. I knew what he must suffer, for I was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"seized with home-sickness myself. Nearly seven months had passed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"without our having had any news from land; Captain Nemo’s isolation,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"his altered spirits, especially since the fight with the poulps, his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"taciturnity, all made me view things in a different light.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well, sir?” said Ned, seeing I did not reply.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Well, Ned, do you wish me to ask Captain Nemo his intentions","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"concerning us?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, sir.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Although he has already made them known?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes; I wish it settled finally. Speak for me, in my name only, if you","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"like.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But I so seldom meet him. He avoids me.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“That is all the more reason for you to go to see him.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I went to my room. From thence I meant to go to Captain Nemo’s. It","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"would not do to let this opportunity of meeting him slip. I knocked at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the door. No answer. I knocked again, then turned the handle. The door","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"opened, I went in. The Captain was there. Bending over his work-table,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"he had not heard me. Resolved not to go without having spoken, I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"approached him. He raised his head quickly, frowned, and said roughly,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“You here! What do you want?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“To speak to you, Captain.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But I am busy, sir; I am working. I leave you at liberty to shut","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"yourself up; cannot I be allowed the same?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"This reception was not encouraging; but I was determined to hear and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"answer everything.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Sir,” I said coldly, “I have to speak to you on a matter that admits","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of no delay.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“What is that, sir?” he replied, ironically. “Have you discovered","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"something that has escaped me, or has the sea delivered up any new","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"secrets?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"We were at cross-purposes. But, before I could reply, he showed me an","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"open manuscript on his table, and said, in a more serious tone, “Here,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"M. Aronnax, is a manuscript written in several languages. It contains","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the sum of my studies of the sea; and, if it please God, it shall not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"perish with me. This manuscript, signed with my name, complete with the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"history of my life, will be shut up in a little floating case. The last","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"survivor of all of us on board the _Nautilus_ will throw this case into","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the sea, and it will go whither it is borne by the waves.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"This man’s name! his history written by himself! His mystery would then","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"be revealed some day.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Captain,” I said, “I can but approve of the idea that makes you act","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"thus. The result of your studies must not be lost. But the means you","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"employ seem to me to be primitive. Who knows where the winds will carry","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"this case, and in whose hands it will fall? Could you not use some","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"other means? Could not you, or one of yours——”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Never, sir!” he said, hastily interrupting me.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But I and my companions are ready to keep this manuscript in store;","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and, if you will put us at liberty——”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“At liberty?” said the Captain, rising.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, sir; that is the subject on which I wish to question you. For","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"seven months we have been here on board, and I ask you to-day, in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"name of my companions and in my own, if your intention is to keep us","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"here always?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“M. Aronnax, I will answer you to-day as I did seven months ago:","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Whoever enters the _Nautilus_, must never quit it.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“You impose actual slavery upon us!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Give it what name you please.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But everywhere the slave has the right to regain his liberty.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Who denies you this right? Have I ever tried to chain you with an","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"oath?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"He looked at me with his arms crossed.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Sir,” I said, “to return a second time to this subject will be neither","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to your nor to my taste; but, as we have entered upon it, let us go","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"through with it. I repeat, it is not only myself whom it concerns.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Study is to me a relief, a diversion, a passion that could make me","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"forget everything. Like you, I am willing to live obscure, in the frail","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hope of bequeathing one day, to future time, the result of my labours.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"But it is otherwise with Ned Land. Every man, worthy of the name,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"deserves some consideration. Have you thought that love of liberty,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hatred of slavery, can give rise to schemes of revenge in a nature like","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the Canadian’s; that he could think, attempt, and try——”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I was silenced; Captain Nemo rose.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Whatever Ned Land thinks of, attempts, or tries, what does it matter","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to me? I did not seek him! It is not for my pleasure that I keep him on","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"board! As for you, M. Aronnax, you are one of those who can understand","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"everything, even silence. I have nothing more to say to you. Let this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"first time you have come to treat of this subject be the last, for a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"second time I will not listen to you.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I retired. Our situation was critical. I related my conversation to my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"two companions.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“We know now,” said Ned, “that we can expect nothing from this man. The","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_ is nearing Long Island. We will escape, whatever the weather","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"may be.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"But the sky became more and more threatening. Symptoms of a hurricane","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"became manifest. The atmosphere was becoming white and misty. On the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"horizon fine streaks of cirrhous clouds were succeeded by masses of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cumuli. Other low clouds passed swiftly by. The swollen sea rose in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"huge billows. The birds disappeared with the exception of the petrels,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"those friends of the storm. The barometer fell sensibly, and indicated","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"an extreme extension of the vapours. The mixture of the storm glass was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"decomposed under the influence of the electricity that pervaded the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"atmosphere. The tempest burst on the 18th of May, just as the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_ was floating off Long Island, some miles from the port of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"New York. I can describe this strife of the elements! for, instead of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fleeing to the depths of the sea, Captain Nemo, by an unaccountable","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"caprice, would brave it at the surface. The wind blew from the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"south-west at first. Captain Nemo, during the squalls, had taken his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"place on the platform. He had made himself fast, to prevent being","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"washed overboard by the monstrous waves. I had hoisted myself up, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"made myself fast also, dividing my admiration between the tempest and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"this extraordinary man who was coping with it. The raging sea was swept","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"by huge cloud-drifts, which were actually saturated with the waves. The","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_, sometimes lying on its side, sometimes standing up like a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"mast, rolled and pitched terribly. About five o’clock a torrent of rain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fell, that lulled neither sea nor wind. The hurri cane blew nearly","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"forty leagues an hour. It is under these conditions that it overturns","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"houses, breaks iron gates, displaces twenty-four pounders. However, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_, in the midst of the tempest, confirmed the words of a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"clever engineer, “There is no well-constructed hull that cannot defy","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the sea.” This was not a resisting rock; it was a steel spindle,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"obedient and movable, without rigging or masts, that braved its fury","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with impunity. However, I watched these raging waves attentively. They","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"measured fifteen feet in height, and 150 to 175 yards long, and their","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"speed of propagation was thirty feet per second. Their bulk and power","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"increased with the depth of the water. Such waves as these, at the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Hebrides, have displaced a mass weighing 8,400 lbs. They are they","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which, in the tempest of December 23rd, 1864, after destroying the town","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of Yeddo, in Japan, broke the same day on the shores of America. The","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"intensity of the tempest increased with the night. The barometer, as in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"1860 at Reunion during a cyclone, fell seven-tenths at the close of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"day. I saw a large vessel pass the horizon struggling painfully. She","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was trying to lie to under half steam, to keep up above the waves. It","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was probably one of the steamers of the line from New York to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Liverpool, or Havre. It soon disappeared in the gloom. At ten o’clock","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in the evening the sky was on fire. The atmosphere was streaked with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"vivid lightning. I could not bear the brightness of it; while the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"captain, looking at it, seemed to envy the spirit of the tempest. A","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"terrible noise filled the air, a complex noise, made up of the howls of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the crushed waves, the roaring of the wind, and the claps of thunder.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The wind veered suddenly to all points of the horizon; and the cyclone,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rising in the east, returned after passing by the north, west, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"south, in the inverse course pursued by the circular storm of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"southern hemisphere. Ah, that Gulf Stream! It deserves its name of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"King of Tempests. It is that which causes those formidable cyclones, by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the difference of temperature between its air and its currents. A","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shower of fire had succeeded the rain. The drops of water were changed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to sharp spikes. One would have thought that Captain Nemo was courting","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a death worthy of himself, a death by lightning. As the _Nautilus_,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pitching dreadfully, raised its steel spur in the air, it seemed to act","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"as a conductor, and I saw long sparks burst from it. Crushed and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"without strength I crawled to the panel, opened it, and descended to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the saloon. The storm was then at its height. It was impossible to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"stand upright in the interior of the _Nautilus_. Captain Nemo came down","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"about twelve. I heard the reservoirs filling by degrees, and the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_ sank slowly beneath the waves. Through the open windows in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the saloon I saw large fish terrified, passing like phantoms in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"water. Some were struck before my eyes. The _Nautilus_ was still","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"descending. I thought that at about eight fathoms deep we should find a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"calm. But no! the upper beds were too violently agitated for that. We","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"had to seek repose at more than twenty-five fathoms in the bowels of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"FROM LATITUDE 47° 24′ TO LONGITUDE 17° 28′","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"In consequence of the storm, we had been thrown eastward once more. All","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hope of escape on the shores of New York or St. Lawrence had faded","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"away; and poor Ned, in despair, had isolated himself like Captain Nemo.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Conseil and I, however, never left each other. I said that the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_ had gone aside to the east. I should have said (to be more","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"exact) the north-east. For some days, it wandered first on the surface,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and then beneath it, amid those fogs so dreaded by sailors. What","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"accidents are due to these thick fogs! What shocks upon these reefs","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"when the wind drowns the breaking of the waves! What collisions between","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"vessels, in spite of their warning lights, whistles, and alarm bells!","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"And the bottoms of these seas look like a field of battle, where still","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"lie all the conquered of the ocean; some old and already encrusted,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"others fresh and reflecting from their iron bands and copper plates the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"brilliancy of our lantern.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"On the 15th of May we were at the extreme south of the Bank of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Newfoundland. This bank consists of alluvia, or large heaps of organic","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"matter, brought either from the Equator by the Gulf Stream, or from the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"North Pole by the counter-current of cold water which skirts the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"American coast. There also are heaped up those erratic blocks which are","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"carried along by the broken ice; and close by, a vast charnel-house of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"molluscs, which perish here by millions. The depth of the sea is not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"great at Newfoundland—not more than some hundreds of fathoms; but","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"towards the south is a depression of 1,500 fathoms. There the Gulf","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Stream widens. It loses some of its speed and some of its temperature,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"but it becomes a sea.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"It was on the 17th of May, about 500 miles from Heart’s Content, at a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"depth of more than 1,400 fathoms, that I saw the electric cable lying","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"on the bottom. Conseil, to whom I had not mentioned it, thought at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"first that it was a gigantic sea-serpent. But I undeceived the worthy","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fellow, and by way of consolation related several particulars in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"laying of this cable. The first one was laid in the years 1857 and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"1858; but, after transmitting about 400 telegrams, would not act any","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"longer. In 1863 the engineers constructed an other one, measuring 2,000","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"miles in length, and weighing 4,500 tons, which was embarked on the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Great Eastern. This attempt also failed.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"On the 25th of May the _Nautilus_, being at a depth of more than 1,918","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fathoms, was on the precise spot where the rupture occurred which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ruined the enterprise. It was within 638 miles of the coast of Ireland;","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and at half-past two in the afternoon they discovered that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"communication with Europe had ceased. The electricians on board","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"resolved to cut the cable before fishing it up, and at eleven o’clock","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"at night they had recovered the damaged part. They made another point","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and spliced it, and it was once more submerged. But some days after it","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"broke again, and in the depths of the ocean could not be recaptured.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The Americans, however, were not discouraged. Cyrus Field, the bold","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"promoter of the enterprise, as he had sunk all his own fortune, set a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"new subscription on foot, which was at once answered, and another cable","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was constructed on better principles. The bundles of conducting wires","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"were each enveloped in gutta-percha, and protected by a wadding of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hemp, contained in a metallic covering. The Great Eastern sailed on the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"13th of July, 1866. The operation worked well. But one incident","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"occurred. Several times in unrolling the cable they observed that nails","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"had recently been forced into it, evidently with the motive of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"destroying it. Captain Anderson, the officers, and engineers consulted","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"together, and had it posted up that, if the offender was surprised on","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"board, he would be thrown without further trial into the sea. From that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"time the criminal attempt was never repeated.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"On the 23rd of July the Great Eastern was not more than 500 miles from","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Newfoundland, when they telegraphed from Ireland the news of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"armistice concluded between Prussia and Austria after Sadowa. On the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"27th, in the midst of heavy fogs, they reached the port of Heart’s","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Content. The enterprise was successfully terminated; and for its first","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"despatch, young America addressed old Europe in these words of wisdom,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"so rarely understood: “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"goodwill towards men.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I did not expect to find the electric cable in its primitive state,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"such as it was on leaving the manufactory. The long serpent, covered","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with the remains of shells, bristling with foraminiferae, was encrusted","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with a strong coating which served as a protection against all boring","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"molluscs. It lay quietly sheltered from the motions of the sea, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"under a favourable pressure for the transmission of the electric spark","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which passes from Europe to America in .32 of a second. Doubtless this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cable will last for a great length of time, for they find that the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"gutta-percha covering is improved by the sea-water. Besides, on this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"level, so well chosen, the cable is never so deeply submerged as to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cause it to break. The _Nautilus_ followed it to the lowest depth,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which was more than 2,212 fathoms, and there it lay without any","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"anchorage; and then we reached the spot where the accident had taken","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"place in 1863. The bottom of the ocean then formed a valley about 100","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"miles broad, in which Mont Blanc might have been placed without its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"summit appearing above the waves. This valley is closed at the east by","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a perpendicular wall more than 2,000 yards high. We arrived there on","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the 28th of May, and the _Nautilus_ was then not more than 120 miles","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"from Ireland.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Was Captain Nemo going to land on the British Isles? No. To my great","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"surprise he made for the south, once more coming back towards European","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"seas. In rounding the Emerald Isle, for one instant I caught sight of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Cape Clear, and the light which guides the thousands of vessels leaving","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Glasgow or Liverpool. An important question then arose in my mind. Did","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the _Nautilus_ dare entangle itself in the Manche? Ned Land, who had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"re-appeared since we had been nearing land, did not cease to question","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"me. How could I answer? Captain Nemo remained invisible. After having","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shown the Canadian a glimpse of American shores, was he going to show","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"me the coast of France?","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"But the _Nautilus_ was still going southward. On the 30th of May, it","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"passed in sight of Land’s End, between the extreme point of England and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the Scilly Isles, which were left to starboard. If we wished to enter","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the Manche, he must go straight to the east. He did not do so.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"During the whole of the 31st of May, the _Nautilus_ described a series","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of circles on the water, which greatly interested me. It seemed to be","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"seeking a spot it had some trouble in finding. At noon, Captain Nemo","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"himself came to work the ship’s log. He spoke no word to me, but seemed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"gloomier than ever. What could sadden him thus? Was it his proxim ity","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to European shores? Had he some recollections of his abandoned country?","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"If not, what did he feel? Remorse or regret? For a long while this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"thought haunted my mind, and I had a kind of presentiment that before","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"long chance would betray the captain’s secrets.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The next day, the 1st of June, the _Nautilus_ continued the same","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"process. It was evidently seeking some particular spot in the ocean.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo took the sun’s altitude as he had done the day before. The","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sea was beautiful, the sky clear. About eight miles to the east, a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"large steam vessel could be discerned on the horizon. No flag fluttered","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"from its mast, and I could not discover its nationality. Some minutes","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"before the sun passed the meridian, Captain Nemo took his sextant, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"watched with great attention. The perfect rest of the water greatly","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"helped the operation. The _Nautilus_ was motionless; it neither rolled","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"nor pitched.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I was on the platform when the altitude was taken, and the Captain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pronounced these words: “It is here.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"He turned and went below. Had he seen the vessel which was changing its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"course and seemed to be nearing us? I could not tell. I returned to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"saloon. The panels closed, I heard the hissing of the water in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"reservoirs. The _Nautilus_ began to sink, following a vertical line,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"for its screw communicated no motion to it. Some minutes later it","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"stopped at a depth of more than 420 fathoms, resting on the ground. The","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"luminous ceiling was darkened, then the panels were opened, and through","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the glass I saw the sea brilliantly illuminated by the rays of our","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"lantern for at least half a mile round us.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I looked to the port side, and saw nothing but an immensity of quiet","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"waters. But to starboard, on the bottom appeared a large protuberance,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which at once attracted my attention. One would have thought it a ruin","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"buried under a coating of white shells, much resembling a covering of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"snow. Upon examining the mass attentively, I could recognise the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ever-thickening form of a vessel bare of its masts, which must have","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sunk. It certainly belonged to past times. This wreck, to be thus","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"encrusted with the lime of the water, must already be able to count","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"many years passed at the bottom of the ocean.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"What was this vessel? Why did the _Nautilus_ visit its tomb? Could it","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"have been aught but a shipwreck which had drawn it under the water? I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"knew not what to think, when near me in a slow voice I heard Captain","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Nemo say:","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“At one time this ship was called the Marseillais. It carried","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"seventy-four guns, and was launched in 1762. In 1778, the 13th of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"August, commanded by La Poype-Ver trieux, it fought boldly against the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Preston. In 1779, on the 4th of July, it was at the taking of Grenada,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with the squadron of Admiral Estaing. In 1781, on the 5th of September,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"it took part in the battle of Comte de Grasse, in Chesapeake Bay. In","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"1794, the French Republic changed its name. On the 16th of April, in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the same year, it joined the squadron of Villaret Joyeuse, at Brest,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"being entrusted with the escort of a cargo of corn coming from America,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"under the command of Admiral Van Stebel. On the 11th and 12th Prairal","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the second year, this squadron fell in with an English vessel. Sir,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to-day is the 13th Prairal, the first of June, 1868. It is now","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"seventy-four years ago, day for day on this very spot, in latitude 47°","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"24′, longitude 17° 28′, that this vessel, after fighting heroically,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"losing its three masts, with the water in its hold, and the third of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"its crew disabled, preferred sinking with its 356 sailors to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"surrendering; and, nailing its colours to the poop, disappeared under","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the waves to the cry of ‘Long live the Republic!’”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“The Avenger!” I exclaimed.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, sir, the Avenger! A good name!” muttered Captain Nemo, crossing","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"his arms.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"CHAPTER XXI","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"A HECATOMB","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The way of describing this unlooked-for scene, the history of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"patriot ship, told at first so coldly, and the emotion with which this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"strange man pronounced the last words, the name of the Avenger, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"significance of which could not escape me, all impressed itself deeply","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"on my mind. My eyes did not leave the Captain, who, with his hand","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"stretched out to sea, was watching with a glowing eye the glorious","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"wreck. Perhaps I was never to know who he was, from whence he came, or","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"where he was going to, but I saw the man move, and apart from the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_savant_. It was no common misanthropy which had shut Captain Nemo and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"his companions within the _Nautilus_, but a hatred, either monstrous or","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sublime, which time could never weaken. Did this hatred still seek for","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"vengeance? The future would soon teach me that. But the _Nautilus_ was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rising slowly to the surface of the sea, and the form of the Avenger","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"disappeared by degrees from my sight. Soon a slight rolling told me","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that we were in the open air. At that moment a dull boom was heard. I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"looked at the Captain. He did not move.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Captain?” said I.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"He did not answer. I left him and mounted the platform. Conseil and the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Canadian were already there.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Where did that sound come from?” I asked.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“It was a gunshot,” replied Ned Land.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I looked in the direction of the vessel I had already seen. It was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"nearing the _Nautilus_, and we could see that it was putting on steam.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"It was within six miles of us.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“What is that ship, Ned?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“By its rigging, and the height of its lower masts,” said the Canadian,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I bet she is a ship-of-war. May it reach us; and, if necessary, sink","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"this cursed _Nautilus_.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Friend Ned,” replied Conseil, “what harm can it do to the _Nautilus?_","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Can it attack it beneath the waves? Can its cannonade us at the bottom","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the sea?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Tell me, Ned,” said I, “can you recognise what country she belongs","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The Canadian knitted his eyebrows, dropped his eyelids, and screwed up","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the corners of his eyes, and for a few moments fixed a piercing look","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"upon the vessel.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“No, sir,” he replied; “I cannot tell what nation she belongs to, for","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"she shows no colours. But I can declare she is a man-of-war, for a long","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pennant flutters from her main mast.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"For a quarter of an hour we watched the ship which was steaming towards","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"us. I could not, however, believe that she could see the _Nautilus_","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"from that distance; and still less that she could know what this","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"submarine engine was. Soon the Canadian informed me that she was a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"large, armoured, two-decker ram. A thick black smoke was pouring from","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"her two funnels. Her closely-furled sails were stopped to her yards.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"She hoisted no flag at her mizzen-peak. The distance prevented us from","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"distinguishing the colours of her pennant, which floated like a thin","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ribbon. She advanced rapidly. If Captain Nemo allowed her to approach,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"there was a chance of salvation for us.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Sir,” said Ned Land, “if that vessel passes within a mile of us I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shall throw myself into the sea, and I should advise you to do the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"same.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I did not reply to the Canadian’s suggestion, but continued watching","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the ship. Whether English, French, American, or Russian, she would be","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sure to take us in if we could only reach her. Presently a white smoke","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"burst from the fore part of the vessel; some seconds after, the water,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"agitated by the fall of a heavy body, splashed the stern of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_, and shortly afterwards a loud explosion struck my ear.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“What! they are firing at us!” I exclaimed.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“So please you, sir,” said Ned, “they have recognised the unicorn, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"they are firing at us.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But,” I exclaimed, “surely they can see that there are men in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"case?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“It is, perhaps, because of that,” replied Ned Land, looking at me.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"A whole flood of light burst upon my mind. Doubtless they knew now how","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to believe the stories of the pretended monster. No doubt, on board the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Abraham Lincoln_, when the Canadian struck it with the harpoon,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Commander Farragut had recognised in the supposed narwhal a submarine","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"vessel, more dangerous than a supernatural cetacean. Yes, it must have","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"been so; and on every sea they were now seeking this engine of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"destruction. Terrible indeed! if, as we supposed, Captain Nemo employed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the _Nautilus_ in works of vengeance. On the night when we were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"imprisoned in that cell, in the midst of the Indian Ocean, had he not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"attacked some vessel? The man buried in the coral cemetery, had he not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"been a victim to the shock caused by the _Nautilus?_ Yes, I repeat it,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"it must be so. One part of the mysterious existence of Captain Nemo had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"been unveiled; and, if his identity had not been recognised, at least,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the nations united against him were no longer hunting a chimerical","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"creature, but a man who had vowed a deadly hatred against them. All the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"formidable past rose before me. Instead of meeting friends on board the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"approaching ship, we could only expect pitiless enemies. But the shot","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rattled about us. Some of them struck the sea and ricochetted, losing","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"themselves in the distance. But none touched the _Nautilus_. The vessel","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was not more than three miles from us. In spite of the serious","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cannonade, Captain Nemo did not appear on the platform; but, if one of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the conical projectiles had struck the shell of the _Nautilus_, it","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"would have been fatal. The Canadian then said, “Sir, we must do all we","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"can to get out of this dilemma. Let us signal them. They will then,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"perhaps, understand that we are honest folks.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Ned Land took his handkerchief to wave in the air; but he had scarcely","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"displayed it, when he was struck down by an iron hand, and fell, in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"spite of his great strength, upon the deck.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Fool!” exclaimed the Captain, “do you wish to be pierced by the spur","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the _Nautilus_ before it is hurled at this vessel?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo was terrible to hear; he was still more terrible to see.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"His face was deadly pale, with a spasm at his heart. For an instant it","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"must have ceased to beat. His pupils were fearfully contracted. He did","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"not speak, he roared, as, with his body thrown forward, he wrung the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Canadian’s shoulders. Then, leaving him, and turning to the ship of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"war, whose shot was still raining around him, he exclaimed, with a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"powerful voice, “Ah, ship of an accursed nation, you know who I am! I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"do not want your colours to know you by! Look! and I will show you","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"mine!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"And on the fore part of the platform Captain Nemo unfurled a black","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"flag, similar to the one he had placed at the South Pole. At that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"moment a shot struck the shell of the _Nautilus_ obliquely, without","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"piercing it; and, rebounding near the Captain, was lost in the sea. He","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shrugged his shoulders; and, addressing me, said shortly, “Go down, you","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and your companions, go down!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Sir,” I cried, “are you going to attack this vessel?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Sir, I am going to sink it.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“You will not do that?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I shall do it,” he replied coldly. “And I advise you not to judge me,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sir. Fate has shown you what you ought not to have seen. The attack has","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"begun; go down.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“What is this vessel?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“You do not know? Very well! so much the better! Its nationality to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"you, at least, will be a secret. Go down!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"We could but obey. About fifteen of the sailors surrounded the Captain,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"looking with implacable hatred at the vessel nearing them. One could","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"feel that the same desire of vengeance animated every soul. I went down","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"at the moment another projectile struck the _Nautilus_, and I heard the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain exclaim:","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Strike, mad vessel! Shower your useless shot! And then, you will not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"escape the spur of the _Nautilus_. But it is not here that you shall","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"perish! I would not have your ruins mingle with those of the Avenger!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I reached my room. The Captain and his second had remained on the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"platform. The screw was set in motion, and the _Nautilus_, moving with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"speed, was soon beyond the reach of the ship’s guns. But the pursuit","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"continued, and Captain Nemo contented himself with keeping his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"distance.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"About four in the afternoon, being no longer able to contain my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"impatience, I went to the central staircase. The panel was open, and I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ventured on to the platform. The Captain was still walking up and down","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with an agitated step. He was looking at the ship, which was five or","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"six miles to leeward.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"He was going round it like a wild beast, and, drawing it eastward, he","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"allowed them to pursue. But he did not attack. Perhaps he still","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hesitated? I wished to mediate once more. But I had scarcely spoken,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"when Captain Nemo imposed silence, saying:","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I am the law, and I am the judge! I am the oppressed, and there is the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"oppressor! Through him I have lost all that I loved, cherished, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"venerated—country, wife, children, father, and mother. I saw all","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"perish! All that I hate is there! Say no more!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I cast a last look at the man-of-war, which was putting on steam, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rejoined Ned and Conseil.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“We will fly!” I exclaimed.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Good!” said Ned. “What is this vessel?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I do not know; but, whatever it is, it will be sunk before night. In","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"any case, it is better to perish with it, than be made accomplices in a","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"retaliation the justice of which we cannot judge.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“That is my opinion too,” said Ned Land, coolly. “Let us wait for","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"night.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Night arrived. Deep silence reigned on board. The compass showed that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the _Nautilus_ had not altered its course. It was on the surface,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rolling slightly. My companions and I resolved to fly when the vessel","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"should be near enough either to hear us or to see us; for the moon,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which would be full in two or three days, shone brightly. Once on board","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the ship, if we could not prevent the blow which threatened it, we","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"could, at least we would, do all that circumstances would allow.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Several times I thought the _Nautilus_ was preparing for attack; but","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo contented himself with allowing his adversary to approach,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and then fled once more before it.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Part of the night passed without any incident. We watched the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"opportunity for action. We spoke little, for we were too much moved.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Ned Land would have thrown himself into the sea, but I forced him to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"wait. According to my idea, the _Nautilus_ would attack the ship at her","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"waterline, and then it would not only be possible, but easy to fly.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At three in the morning, full of uneasiness, I mounted the platform.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Captain Nemo had not left it. He was standing at the fore part near his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"flag, which a slight breeze displayed above his head. He did not take","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"his eyes from the vessel. The intensity of his look seemed to attract,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and fascinate, and draw it onward more surely than if he had been","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"towing it. The moon was then passing the meridian. Jupiter was rising","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"in the east. Amid this peaceful scene of nature, sky and ocean rivalled","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"each other in tranquillity, the sea offering to the orbs of night the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"finest mirror they could ever have in which to reflect their image. As","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I thought of the deep calm of these elements, compared with all those","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"passions brooding imperceptibly within the _Nautilus_, I shuddered.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The vessel was within two miles of us. It was ever nearing that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"phosphorescent light which showed the presence of the _Nautilus_. I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"could see its green and red lights, and its white lantern hanging from","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the large foremast. An indistinct vibration quivered through its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rigging, showing that the furnaces were heated to the uttermost.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Sheaves of sparks and red ashes flew from the funnels, shining in the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"atmosphere like stars.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I remained thus until six in the morning, without Captain Nemo noticing","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"me. The ship stood about a mile and a half from us, and with the first","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"dawn of day the firing began afresh. The moment could not be far off","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"when, the _Nautilus_ attacking its adversary, my companions and myself","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"should for ever leave this man. I was preparing to go down to remind","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"them, when the second mounted the platform, accompanied by several","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sailors. Captain Nemo either did not or would not see them. Some steps","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"were taken which might be called the signal for action. They were very","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"simple. The iron balustrade around the platform was lowered, and the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"lantern and pilot cages were pushed within the shell until they were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"flush with the deck. The long surface of the steel cigar no longer","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"offered a single point to check its manœuvres. I returned to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"saloon. The _Nautilus_ still floated; some streaks of light were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"filtering through the liquid beds. With the undulations of the waves","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the windows were brightened by the red streaks of the rising sun, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"this dreadful day of the 2nd of June had dawned.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At five o’clock, the log showed that the speed of the _Nautilus_ was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"slackening, and I knew that it was allowing them to draw nearer.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Besides, the reports were heard more distinctly, and the projectiles,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"labouring through the ambient water, were extinguished with a strange","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hissing noise.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“My friends,” said I, “the moment is come. One grasp of the hand, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"may God protect us!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Ned Land was resolute, Conseil calm, myself so nervous that I knew not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"how to contain myself. We all passed into the library; but the moment I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pushed the door opening on to the central staircase, I heard the upper","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"panel close sharply. The Canadian rushed on to the stairs, but I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"stopped him. A well-known hissing noise told me that the water was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"running into the reservoirs, and in a few minutes the _Nautilus_ was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"some yards beneath the surface of the waves. I understood the manœuvre.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"It was too late to act. The _Nautilus_ did not wish to strike at the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"impenetrable cuirass, but below the water-line, where the metallic","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"covering no longer protected it.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"We were again imprisoned, unwilling witnesses of the dreadful drama","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that was preparing. We had scarcely time to reflect; taking refuge in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"my room, we looked at each other without speaking. A deep stupor had","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"taken hold of my mind: thought seemed to stand still. I was in that","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"painful state of expectation preceding a dreadful report. I waited, I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"listened, every sense was merged in that of hearing! The speed of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_ was accelerated. It was preparing to rush. The whole ship","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"trembled. Suddenly I screamed. I felt the shock, but comparatively","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"light. I felt the penetrating power of the steel spur. I heard","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"rattlings and scrapings. But the _Nautilus_, carried along by its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"propelling power, passed through the mass of the vessel like a needle","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"through sailcloth!","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I could stand it no longer. Mad, out of my mind, I rushed from my room","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"into the saloon. Captain Nemo was there, mute, gloomy, implacable; he","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was looking through the port panel. A large mass cast a shadow on the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"water; and, that it might lose nothing of her agony, the _Nautilus_ was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"going down into the abyss with her. Ten yards from me I saw the open","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shell, through which the water was rushing with the noise of thunder,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"then the double line of guns and the netting. The bridge was covered","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with black, agitated shadows.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The water was rising. The poor creatures were crowding the ratlines,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"clinging to the masts, struggling under the water. It was a human","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"ant-heap overtaken by the sea. Paralysed, stiffened with anguish, my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hair standing on end, with eyes wide open, panting, without breath, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"without voice, I too was watching! An irresistible attraction glued me","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to the glass! Suddenly an explosion took place. The compressed air blew","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"up her decks, as if the magazines had caught fire. Then the unfortunate","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"vessel sank more rapidly. Her topmast, laden with victims, now","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"appeared; then her spars, bending under the weight of men; and, last of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"all, the top of her mainmast. Then the dark mass disappeared, and with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"it the dead crew, drawn down by the strong eddy.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"[Illustration] The unfortunate vessel sank more rapidly","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I turned to Captain Nemo. That terrible avenger, a perfect archangel of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hatred, was still looking. When all was over, he turned to his room,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"opened the door, and entered. I followed him with my eyes. On the end","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"wall beneath his heroes, I saw the portrait of a woman, still young,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and two little children. Captain Nemo looked at them for some moments,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"stretched his arms towards them, and, kneeling down, burst into deep","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"sobs.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"CHAPTER XXII","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"THE LAST WORDS OF CAPTAIN NEMO","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The panels had closed on this dreadful vision, but light had not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"returned to the saloon: all was silence and darkness within the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_. At wonderful speed, a hundred feet beneath the water, it","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was leaving this desolate spot. Whither was it going? To the north or","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"south? Where was the man flying to after such dreadful retaliation? I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"had returned to my room, where Ned and Conseil had remained silent","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"enough. I felt an insurmountable horror for Captain Nemo. Whatever he","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"had suffered at the hands of these men, he had no right to punish thus.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"He had made me, if not an accomplice, at least a witness of his","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"vengeance. At eleven the electric light reappeared. I passed into the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"saloon. It was deserted. I consulted the different instruments. The","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Nautilus_ was flying northward at the rate of twenty-five miles an","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hour, now on the surface, and now thirty feet below it. On taking the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"bearings by the chart, I saw that we were passing the mouth of the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Manche, and that our course was hurrying us towards the northern seas","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"at a frightful speed. That night we had crossed two hundred leagues of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the Atlantic. The shadows fell, and the sea was covered with darkness","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"until the rising of the moon. I went to my room, but could not sleep. I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was troubled with dreadful nightmare. The horrible scene of destruction","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was continually before my eyes. From that day, who could tell into what","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"part of the North Atlantic basin the _Nautilus_ would take us? Still","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"with unaccountable speed. Still in the midst of these northern fogs.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Would it touch at Spitzbergen, or on the shores of Nova Zembla? Should","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"we explore those unknown seas, the White Sea, the Sea of Kara, the Gulf","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of Obi, the Archipelago of Liarrov, and the unknown coast of Asia? I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"could not say. I could no longer judge of the time that was passing.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The clocks had been stopped on board. It seemed, as in polar countries,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"that night and day no longer followed their regular course. I felt","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"myself being drawn into that strange region where the foundered","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"imagination of Edgar Poe roamed at will. Like the fabulous Gordon Pym,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"at every moment I expected to see “that veiled human figure, of larger","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"proportions than those of any inhabitant of the earth, thrown across","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the cataract which defends the approach to the pole.” I estimated","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"(though, perhaps, I may be mistaken)—I estimated this adventurous","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"course of the _Nautilus_ to have lasted fifteen or twenty days. And I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"know not how much longer it might have lasted, had it not been for the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"catastrophe which ended this voyage. Of Captain Nemo I saw nothing","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"whatever now, nor of his second. Not a man of the crew was visible for","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"an instant. The _Nautilus_ was almost incessantly under water. When we","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"came to the surface to renew the air, the panels opened and shut","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"mechanically. There were no more marks on the planisphere. I knew not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"where we were. And the Canadian, too, his strength and patience at an","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"end, appeared no more. Conseil could not draw a word from him; and,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fearing that, in a dreadful fit of madness, he might kill himself,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"watched him with constant devotion. One morning (what date it was I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"could not say) I had fallen into a heavy sleep towards the early hours,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"a sleep both painful and unhealthy, when I suddenly awoke. Ned Land was","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"leaning over me, saying, in a low voice, “We are going to fly.” I sat","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"up.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“When shall we go?” I asked.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“To-night. All inspection on board the _Nautilus_ seems to have ceased.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"All appear to be stupefied. You will be ready, sir?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes; where are we?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“In sight of land. I took the reckoning this morning in the fog—twenty","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"miles to the east.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“What country is it?”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I do not know; but, whatever it is, we will take refuge there.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Yes, Ned, yes. We will fly to-night, even if the sea should swallow us","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"up.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“The sea is bad, the wind violent, but twenty miles in that light boat","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of the _Nautilus_ does not frighten me. Unknown to the crew, I have","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"been able to procure food and some bottles of water.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“I will follow you.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“But,” continued the Canadian, “if I am surprised, I will defend","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"myself; I will force them to kill me.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“We will die together, friend Ned.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I had made up my mind to all. The Canadian left me. I reached the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"platform, on which I could with difficulty support myself against the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"shock of the waves. The sky was threatening; but, as land was in those","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"thick brown shadows, we must fly. I returned to the saloon, fearing and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"yet hoping to see Captain Nemo, wishing and yet not wishing to see him.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"What could I have said to him? Could I hide the involuntary horror with","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"which he inspired me? No. It was better that I should not meet him face","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to face; better to forget him. And yet—— How long seemed that day, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"last that I should pass in the _Nautilus_. I remained alone. Ned Land","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and Conseil avoided speaking, for fear of betraying themselves. At six","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I dined, but I was not hungry; I forced myself to eat in spite of my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"disgust, that I might not weaken myself. At half-past six Ned Land came","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to my room, saying, “We shall not see each other again before our","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"departure. At ten the moon will not be risen. We will profit by the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"darkness. Come to the boat; Conseil and I will wait for you.”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The Canadian went out without giving me time to answer. Wishing to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"verify the course of the _Nautilus_, I went to the saloon. We were","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"running N.N.E. at frightful speed, and more than fifty yards deep. I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"cast a last look on these wonders of nature, on the riches of art","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"heaped up in this museum, upon the unrivalled collection destined to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"perish at the bottom of the sea, with him who had formed it. I wished","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to fix an indelible impression of it in my mind. I remained an hour","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"thus, bathed in the light of that luminous ceiling, and passing in","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"review those treasures shining under their glasses. Then I returned to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"my room.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I dressed myself in strong sea clothing. I collected my notes, placing","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"them carefully about me. My heart beat loudly. I could not check its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"pulsations. Certainly my trouble and agitation would have betrayed me","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to Captain Nemo’s eyes. What was he doing at this moment? I listened at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the door of his room. I heard steps. Captain Nemo was there. He had not","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"gone to rest. At every moment I expected to see him appear, and ask me","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"why I wished to fly. I was constantly on the alert. My imagination","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"magnified everything. The impression became at last so poignant that I","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"asked myself if it would not be better to go to the Captain’s room, see","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"him face to face, and brave him with look and gesture.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"It was the inspiration of a madman; fortunately I resisted the desire,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"and stretched myself on my bed to quiet my bodily agitation. My nerves","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"were somewhat calmer, but in my excited brain I saw over again all my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"existence on board the _Nautilus;_ every incident, either happy or","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"unfortunate, which had happened since my disappearance from the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"_Abraham Lincoln_—the submarine hunt, the Torres Straits, the savages","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"of Papua, the running ashore, the coral cemetery, the passage of Suez,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the Island of Santorin, the Cretan diver, Vigo Bay, Atlantis, the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"iceberg, the South Pole, the imprisonment in the ice, the fight among","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the poulps, the storm in the Gulf Stream, the Avenger, and the horrible","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"scene of the vessel sunk with all her crew. All these events passed","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"before my eyes like scenes in a drama. Then Captain Nemo seemed to grow","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"enormously, his features to assume superhuman proportions. He was no","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"longer my equal, but a man of the waters, the genie of the sea.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"It was then half-past nine. I held my head between my hands to keep it","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"from bursting. I closed my eyes; I would not think any longer. There","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was another half-hour to wait, another half-hour of a nightmare, which","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"might drive me mad.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At that moment I heard the distant strains of the organ, a sad harmony","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to an undefinable chant, the wail of a soul longing to break these","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"earthly bonds. I listened with every sense, scarcely breathing;","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"plunged, like Captain Nemo, in that musical ecstasy, which was drawing","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"him in spirit to the end of life.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Then a sudden thought terrified me. Captain Nemo had left his room. He","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was in the saloon, which I must cross to fly. There I should meet him","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"for the last time. He would see me, perhaps speak to me. A gesture of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"his might destroy me, a single word chain me on board.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"But ten was about to strike. The moment had come for me to leave my","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"room, and join my companions.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I must not hesitate, even if Captain Nemo himself should rise before","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"me. I opened my door carefully; and even then, as it turned on its","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"hinges, it seemed to me to make a dreadful noise. Perhaps it only","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"existed in my own imagination.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I crept along the dark stairs of the _Nautilus_, stopping at each step","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"to check the beating of my heart. I reached the door of the saloon, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"opened it gently. It was plunged in profound darkness. The strains of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the organ sounded faintly. Captain Nemo was there. He did not see me.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"In the full light I do not think he would have noticed me, so entirely","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"was he absorbed in the ecstasy.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I crept along the carpet, avoiding the slightest sound which might","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"betray my presence. I was at least five minutes reaching the door, at","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"the opposite side, opening into the library.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I was going to open it, when a sigh from Captain Nemo nailed me to the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"spot. I knew that he was rising. I could even see him, for the light","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"from the library came through to the saloon. He came towards me","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"silently, with his arms crossed, gliding like a spectre rather than","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"walking. His breast was swelling with sobs; and I heard him murmur","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"these words (the last which ever struck my ear):","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Almighty God! enough! enough!”","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"Was it a confession of remorse which thus escaped from this man’s","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"conscience?","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"In desperation, I rushed through the library, mounted the central","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"staircase, and, following the upper flight, reached the boat. I crept","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"through the opening, which had already admitted my two companions.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Let us go! let us go!” I exclaimed.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"“Directly!” replied the Canadian.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"The orifice in the plates of the _Nautilus_ was first closed, and","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"fastened down by means of a false key, with which Ned Land had provided","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"himself; the opening in the boat was also closed. The Canadian began to","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"loosen the bolts which still held us to the submarine boat.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"Conseil, and myself ever came out of the gulf, I cannot tell.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"But when I returned to consciousness, I was lying in a fisherman’s hut,","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"on the Loffoden Isles. My two companions, safe and sound, were near me","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"holding my hands. We embraced each other heartily.","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"At that moment we could not think of returning to France. The means of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"And, among the worthy people who have so kindly received us, I revise","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"not a detail exaggerated. It is a faithful narrative of this incredible","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"But what has become of the _Nautilus?_ Did it resist the pressure of","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"Will the waves one day carry to him this manuscript containing the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"
"I hope so. And I also hope that his powerful vessel has conquered the","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"where so many other vessels have been lost! If it be so—if Captain Nemo","Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"_Walt Whitman has somewhere a fine and just distinction between “loving","Pride and Prejudice"
"by allowance” and “loving with personal love.” This distinction applies","Pride and Prejudice"
"to books as well as to men and women; and in the case of the not very","Pride and Prejudice"
"numerous authors who are the objects of the personal affection, it","Pride and Prejudice"
"brings a curious consequence with it. There is much more difference as","Pride and Prejudice"
"to their best work than in the case of those others who are loved “by","Pride and Prejudice"
"allowance” by convention, and because it is felt to be the right and","Pride and Prejudice"
"proper thing to love them. And in the sect--fairly large and yet","Pride and Prejudice"
"unusually choice--of Austenians or Janites, there would probably be","Pride and Prejudice"
"found partisans of the claim to primacy of almost every one of the","Pride and Prejudice"
"novels. To some the delightful freshness and humour of_ Northanger","Pride and Prejudice"
"Abbey, _its completeness, finish, and_ entrain, _obscure the undoubted","Pride and Prejudice"
"critical facts that its scale is small, and its scheme, after all, that","Pride and Prejudice"
"of burlesque or parody, a kind in which the first rank is reached with","Pride and Prejudice"
"difficulty._ Persuasion, _relatively faint in tone, and not enthralling","Pride and Prejudice"
"in interest, has devotees who exalt above all the others its exquisite","Pride and Prejudice"
"delicacy and keeping. The catastrophe of_ Mansfield Park _is admittedly","Pride and Prejudice"
"theatrical, the hero and heroine are insipid, and the author has almost","Pride and Prejudice"
"wickedly destroyed all romantic interest by expressly admitting that","Pride and Prejudice"
"Edmund only took Fanny because Mary shocked him, and that Fanny might","Pride and Prejudice"
"very likely have taken Crawford if he had been a little more assiduous;","Pride and Prejudice"
"yet the matchless rehearsal-scenes and the characters of Mrs. Norris and","Pride and Prejudice"
"others have secured, I believe, a considerable party for it._ Sense and","Pride and Prejudice"
"Sensibility _has perhaps the fewest out-and-out admirers; but it does","Pride and Prejudice"
"not want them._","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"_I suppose, however, that the majority of at least competent votes","Pride and Prejudice"
"would, all things considered, be divided between_ Emma _and the present","Pride and Prejudice"
"book; and perhaps the vulgar verdict (if indeed a fondness for Miss","Pride and Prejudice"
"Austen be not of itself a patent of exemption from any possible charge","Pride and Prejudice"
"of vulgarity) would go for_ Emma. _It is the larger, the more varied, the","Pride and Prejudice"
"more popular; the author had by the time of its composition seen rather","Pride and Prejudice"
"more of the world, and had improved her general, though not her most","Pride and Prejudice"
"peculiar and characteristic dialogue; such figures as Miss Bates, as the","Pride and Prejudice"
"Eltons, cannot but unite the suffrages of everybody. On the other hand,","Pride and Prejudice"
"I, for my part, declare for_ Pride and Prejudice _unhesitatingly. It","Pride and Prejudice"
"seems to me the most perfect, the most characteristic, the most","Pride and Prejudice"
"eminently quintessential of its author’s works; and for this contention","Pride and Prejudice"
"in such narrow space as is permitted to me, I propose here to show","Pride and Prejudice"
"cause._","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"_In the first place, the book (it may be barely necessary to remind the","Pride and Prejudice"
"reader) was in its first shape written very early, somewhere about 1796,","Pride and Prejudice"
"when Miss Austen was barely twenty-one; though it was revised and","Pride and Prejudice"
"finished at Chawton some fifteen years later, and was not published till","Pride and Prejudice"
"1813, only four years before her death. I do not know whether, in this","Pride and Prejudice"
"combination of the fresh and vigorous projection of youth, and the","Pride and Prejudice"
"critical revision of middle life, there may be traced the distinct","Pride and Prejudice"
"superiority in point of construction, which, as it seems to me, it","Pride and Prejudice"
"possesses over all the others. The plot, though not elaborate, is almost","Pride and Prejudice"
"regular enough for Fielding; hardly a character, hardly an incident","Pride and Prejudice"
"could be retrenched without loss to the story. The elopement of Lydia","Pride and Prejudice"
"and Wickham is not, like that of Crawford and Mrs. Rushworth, a_ coup de","Pride and Prejudice"
"théâtre; _it connects itself in the strictest way with the course of the","Pride and Prejudice"
"story earlier, and brings about the denouement with complete propriety.","Pride and Prejudice"
"All the minor passages--the loves of Jane and Bingley, the advent of Mr.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Collins, the visit to Hunsford, the Derbyshire tour--fit in after the","Pride and Prejudice"
"same unostentatious, but masterly fashion. There is no attempt at the","Pride and Prejudice"
"hide-and-seek, in-and-out business, which in the transactions between","Pride and Prejudice"
"Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax contributes no doubt a good deal to the","Pride and Prejudice"
"intrigue of_ Emma, _but contributes it in a fashion which I do not think","Pride and Prejudice"
"the best feature of that otherwise admirable book. Although Miss Austen","Pride and Prejudice"
"always liked something of the misunderstanding kind, which afforded her","Pride and Prejudice"
"opportunities for the display of the peculiar and incomparable talent to","Pride and Prejudice"
"be noticed presently, she has been satisfied here with the perfectly","Pride and Prejudice"
"natural occasions provided by the false account of Darcy’s conduct given","Pride and Prejudice"
"by Wickham, and by the awkwardness (arising with equal naturalness) from","Pride and Prejudice"
"the gradual transformation of Elizabeth’s own feelings from positive","Pride and Prejudice"
"aversion to actual love. I do not know whether the all-grasping hand of","Pride and Prejudice"
"the playwright has ever been laid upon_ Pride and Prejudice; _and I dare","Pride and Prejudice"
"say that, if it were, the situations would prove not startling or","Pride and Prejudice"
"garish enough for the footlights, the character-scheme too subtle and","Pride and Prejudice"
"delicate for pit and gallery. But if the attempt were made, it would","Pride and Prejudice"
"certainly not be hampered by any of those loosenesses of construction,","Pride and Prejudice"
"which, sometimes disguised by the conveniences of which the novelist can","Pride and Prejudice"
"avail himself, appear at once on the stage._","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"_I think, however, though the thought will doubtless seem heretical to","Pride and Prejudice"
"more than one school of critics, that construction is not the highest","Pride and Prejudice"
"merit, the choicest gift, of the novelist. It sets off his other gifts","Pride and Prejudice"
"and graces most advantageously to the critical eye; and the want of it","Pride and Prejudice"
"will sometimes mar those graces--appreciably, though not quite","Pride and Prejudice"
"consciously--to eyes by no means ultra-critical. But a very badly-built","Pride and Prejudice"
"novel which excelled in pathetic or humorous character, or which","Pride and Prejudice"
"displayed consummate command of dialogue--perhaps the rarest of all","Pride and Prejudice"
"faculties--would be an infinitely better thing than a faultless plot","Pride and Prejudice"
"acted and told by puppets with pebbles in their mouths. And despite the","Pride and Prejudice"
"ability which Miss Austen has shown in working out the story, I for one","Pride and Prejudice"
"should put_ Pride and Prejudice _far lower if it did not contain what","Pride and Prejudice"
"seem to me the very masterpieces of Miss Austen’s humour and of her","Pride and Prejudice"
"faculty of character-creation--masterpieces who may indeed admit John","Pride and Prejudice"
"Thorpe, the Eltons, Mrs. Norris, and one or two others to their company,","Pride and Prejudice"
"but who, in one instance certainly, and perhaps in others, are still","Pride and Prejudice"
"superior to them._","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"_The characteristics of Miss Austen’s humour are so subtle and delicate","Pride and Prejudice"
"that they are, perhaps, at all times easier to apprehend than to","Pride and Prejudice"
"express, and at any particular time likely to be differently","Pride and Prejudice"
"apprehended by different persons. To me this humour seems to possess a","Pride and Prejudice"
"greater affinity, on the whole, to that of Addison than to any other of","Pride and Prejudice"
"the numerous species of this great British genus. The differences of","Pride and Prejudice"
"scheme, of time, of subject, of literary convention, are, of course,","Pride and Prejudice"
"obvious enough; the difference of sex does not, perhaps, count for much,","Pride and Prejudice"
"for there was a distinctly feminine element in “Mr. Spectator,” and in","Pride and Prejudice"
"Jane Austen’s genius there was, though nothing mannish, much that was","Pride and Prejudice"
"masculine. But the likeness of quality consists in a great number of","Pride and Prejudice"
"common subdivisions of quality--demureness, extreme minuteness of touch,","Pride and Prejudice"
"avoidance of loud tones and glaring effects. Also there is in both a","Pride and Prejudice"
"certain not inhuman or unamiable cruelty. It is the custom with those","Pride and Prejudice"
"who judge grossly to contrast the good nature of Addison with the","Pride and Prejudice"
"savagery of Swift, the mildness of Miss Austen with the boisterousness","Pride and Prejudice"
"of Fielding and Smollett, even with the ferocious practical jokes that","Pride and Prejudice"
"her immediate predecessor, Miss Burney, allowed without very much","Pride and Prejudice"
"protest. Yet, both in Mr. Addison and in Miss Austen there is, though a","Pride and Prejudice"
"restrained and well-mannered, an insatiable and ruthless delight in","Pride and Prejudice"
"roasting and cutting up a fool. A man in the early eighteenth century,","Pride and Prejudice"
"of course, could push this taste further than a lady in the early","Pride and Prejudice"
"nineteenth; and no doubt Miss Austen’s principles, as well as her heart,","Pride and Prejudice"
"would have shrunk from such things as the letter from the unfortunate","Pride and Prejudice"
"husband in the_ Spectator, _who describes, with all the gusto and all the","Pride and Prejudice"
"innocence in the world, how his wife and his friend induce him to play","Pride and Prejudice"
"at blind-man’s-buff. But another_ Spectator _letter--that of the damsel","Pride and Prejudice"
"of fourteen who wishes to marry Mr. Shapely, and assures her selected","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mentor that “he admires your_ Spectators _mightily”--might have been","Pride and Prejudice"
"written by a rather more ladylike and intelligent Lydia Bennet in the","Pride and Prejudice"
"days of Lydia’s great-grandmother; while, on the other hand, some (I","Pride and Prejudice"
"think unreasonably) have found “cynicism” in touches of Miss Austen’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"own, such as her satire of Mrs. Musgrove’s self-deceiving regrets over","Pride and Prejudice"
"her son. But this word “cynical” is one of the most misused in the","Pride and Prejudice"
"English language, especially when, by a glaring and gratuitous","Pride and Prejudice"
"falsification of its original sense, it is applied, not to rough and","Pride and Prejudice"
"snarling invective, but to gentle and oblique satire. If cynicism means","Pride and Prejudice"
"the perception of “the other side,” the sense of “the accepted hells","Pride and Prejudice"
"beneath,” the consciousness that motives are nearly always mixed, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"that to seem is not identical with to be--if this be cynicism, then","Pride and Prejudice"
"every man and woman who is not a fool, who does not care to live in a","Pride and Prejudice"
"fool’s paradise, who has knowledge of nature and the world and life, is","Pride and Prejudice"
"a cynic. And in that sense Miss Austen certainly was one. She may even","Pride and Prejudice"
"have been one in the further sense that, like her own Mr. Bennet, she","Pride and Prejudice"
"took an epicurean delight in dissecting, in displaying, in setting at","Pride and Prejudice"
"work her fools and her mean persons. I think she did take this delight,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and I do not think at all the worse of her for it as a woman, while she","Pride and Prejudice"
"was immensely the better for it as an artist._","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"_In respect of her art generally, Mr. Goldwin Smith has truly observed","Pride and Prejudice"
"that “metaphor has been exhausted in depicting the perfection of it,","Pride and Prejudice"
"combined with the narrowness of her field;” and he has justly added that","Pride and Prejudice"
"we need not go beyond her own comparison to the art of a miniature","Pride and Prejudice"
"painter. To make this latter observation quite exact we must not use the","Pride and Prejudice"
"term miniature in its restricted sense, and must think rather of Memling","Pride and Prejudice"
"at one end of the history of painting and Meissonier at the other, than","Pride and Prejudice"
"of Cosway or any of his kind. And I am not so certain that I should","Pride and Prejudice"
"myself use the word “narrow” in connection with her. If her world is a","Pride and Prejudice"
"microcosm, the cosmic quality of it is at least as eminent as the","Pride and Prejudice"
"littleness. She does not touch what she did not feel herself called to","Pride and Prejudice"
"paint; I am not so sure that she could not have painted what she did not","Pride and Prejudice"
"feel herself called to touch. It is at least remarkable that in two very","Pride and Prejudice"
"short periods of writing--one of about three years, and another of not","Pride and Prejudice"
"much more than five--she executed six capital works, and has not left a","Pride and Prejudice"
"single failure. It is possible that the romantic paste in her","Pride and Prejudice"
"composition was defective: we must always remember that hardly","Pride and Prejudice"
"anybody born in her decade--that of the eighteenth-century","Pride and Prejudice"
"seventies--independently exhibited the full romantic quality. Even Scott","Pride and Prejudice"
"required hill and mountain and ballad, even Coleridge metaphysics and","Pride and Prejudice"
"German to enable them to chip the classical shell. Miss Austen was an","Pride and Prejudice"
"English girl, brought up in a country retirement, at the time when","Pride and Prejudice"
"ladies went back into the house if there was a white frost which might","Pride and Prejudice"
"pierce their kid shoes, when a sudden cold was the subject of the","Pride and Prejudice"
"gravest fears, when their studies, their ways, their conduct were","Pride and Prejudice"
"subject to all those fantastic limits and restrictions against which","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mary Wollstonecraft protested with better general sense than particular","Pride and Prejudice"
"taste or judgment. Miss Austen, too, drew back when the white frost","Pride and Prejudice"
"touched her shoes; but I think she would have made a pretty good journey","Pride and Prejudice"
"even in a black one._","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"_For if her knowledge was not very extended, she knew two things which","Pride and Prejudice"
"only genius knows. The one was humanity, and the other was art. On the","Pride and Prejudice"
"first head she could not make a mistake; her men, though limited, are","Pride and Prejudice"
"true, and her women are, in the old sense, “absolute.” As to art, if she","Pride and Prejudice"
"has never tried idealism, her realism is real to a degree which makes","Pride and Prejudice"
"the false realism of our own day look merely dead-alive. Take almost any","Pride and Prejudice"
"Frenchman, except the late M. de Maupassant, and watch him laboriously","Pride and Prejudice"
"piling up strokes in the hope of giving a complete impression. You get","Pride and Prejudice"
"none; you are lucky if, discarding two-thirds of what he gives, you can","Pride and Prejudice"
"shape a real impression out of the rest. But with Miss Austen the","Pride and Prejudice"
"myriad, trivial, unforced strokes build up the picture like magic.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Nothing is false; nothing is superfluous. When (to take the present book","Pride and Prejudice"
"only) Mr. Collins changed his mind from Jane to Elizabeth “while Mrs.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bennet was stirring the fire” (and we know_ how _Mrs. Bennet would have","Pride and Prejudice"

"“Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted with him","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I honour your circumspection. A fortnight’s acquaintance is certainly","Pride and Prejudice"

"that, instead of twelve, he had brought only six with him from London,","Pride and Prejudice"

"two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another young man.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike: he had a pleasant","Pride and Prejudice"
"countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His sisters were fine women,","Pride and Prejudice"
"with an air of decided fashion. His brother-in-law, Mr. Hurst, merely","Pride and Prejudice"

"his entrance, of his having ten thousand a year. The gentlemen","Pride and Prejudice"
"pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man, the ladies declared he was","Pride and Prejudice"

"admiration for about half the evening, till his manners gave a disgust","Pride and Prejudice"
"which turned the tide of his popularity; for he was discovered to be","Pride and Prejudice"
"proud, to be above his company, and above being pleased; and not all his","Pride and Prejudice"

"himself at Netherfield. Such amiable qualities must speak for","Pride and Prejudice"
"themselves. What a contrast between him and his friend! Mr. Darcy danced","Pride and Prejudice"
"only once with Mrs. Hurst and once with Miss Bingley, declined being","Pride and Prejudice"
"introduced to any other lady, and spent the rest of the evening in","Pride and Prejudice"
"walking about the room, speaking occasionally to one of his own party.","Pride and Prejudice"
"His character was decided. He was the proudest, most disagreeable man in","Pride and Prejudice"
"the world, and everybody hoped that he would never come there again.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Amongst the most violent against him was Mrs. Bennet, whose dislike of","Pride and Prejudice"
"his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his","Pride and Prejudice"
"having slighted one of her daughters.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen, to sit","Pride and Prejudice"
"down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr. Darcy had been","Pride and Prejudice"
"standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his","Pride and Prejudice"
"friend to join it.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Come, Darcy,” said he, “I must have you dance. I hate to see you","Pride and Prejudice"
"standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much better","Pride and Prejudice"
"dance.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am","Pride and Prejudice"
"particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as this, it","Pride and Prejudice"

"Mr. Bingley followed his advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and Elizabeth","Pride and Prejudice"

"The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family. Mrs.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the Netherfield","Pride and Prejudice"
"party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her twice, and she had been","Pride and Prejudice"
"distinguished by his sisters. Jane was as much gratified by this as her","Pride and Prejudice"
"mother could be, though in a quieter way. Elizabeth felt Jane’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned to Miss Bingley as the most","Pride and Prejudice"
"accomplished girl in the neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been","Pride and Prejudice"
"fortunate enough to be never without partners, which was all that they","Pride and Prejudice"
"had yet learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good","Pride and Prejudice"
"spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which they","Pride and Prejudice"
"were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still up. With a","Pride and Prejudice"
"book, he was regardless of time; and on the present occasion he had a","Pride and Prejudice"
"good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised","Pride and Prejudice"
"such splendid expectations. He had rather hoped that all his wife’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"views on the stranger would be disappointed; but he soon found that he","Pride and Prejudice"
"had a very different story to hear.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Oh, my dear Mr. Bennet,” as she entered the room, “we have had a most","Pride and Prejudice"
"delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had been there.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it. Everybody said how well","Pride and Prejudice"
"she looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her quite beautiful, and danced with","Pride and Prejudice"
"her twice. Only think of _that_, my dear: he actually danced with her","Pride and Prejudice"
"twice; and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second","Pride and Prejudice"
"time. First of all, he asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him stand","Pride and Prejudice"
"up with her; but, however, he did not admire her at all; indeed, nobody","Pride and Prejudice"
"can, you know; and he seemed quite struck with Jane as she was going","Pride and Prejudice"
"down the dance. So he inquired who she was, and got introduced, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"asked her for the two next. Then, the two third he danced with Miss","Pride and Prejudice"
"King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth with Jane","Pride and Prejudice"
"again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the _Boulanger_----”","Pride and Prejudice"

"“If he had had any compassion for _me_,” cried her husband impatiently,","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Oh, my dear,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “I am quite delighted with him. He","Pride and Prejudice"

"she admired him.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“He is just what a young-man ought to be,” said she, “sensible,","Pride and Prejudice"

"with such perfect good breeding!”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"

"“I was very much flattered by his asking me to dance a second time. I","Pride and Prejudice"
"did not expect such a compliment.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Did not you? _I_ did for you. But that is one great difference between","Pride and Prejudice"
"us. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_ never. What","Pride and Prejudice"
"could be more natural than his asking you again? He could not help","Pride and Prejudice"
"seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in","Pride and Prejudice"
"the room. No thanks to his gallantry for that. Well, he certainly is","Pride and Prejudice"
"very agreeable, and I give you leave to like him. You have liked many a","Pride and Prejudice"
"stupider person.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Dear Lizzy!”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Oh, you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in general.","Pride and Prejudice"
"You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good and agreeable","Pride and Prejudice"
"in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I would wish not to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always speak","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I know you do: and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With _your_","Pride and Prejudice"
"good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of","Pride and Prejudice"
"others! Affectation of candour is common enough; one meets with it","Pride and Prejudice"
"everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or design,--to take the","Pride and Prejudice"
"good of everybody’s character and make it still better, and say nothing","Pride and Prejudice"
"of the bad,--belongs to you alone. And so, you like this man’s sisters,","Pride and Prejudice"
"too, do you? Their manners are not equal to his.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Certainly not, at first; but they are very pleasing women when you","Pride and Prejudice"
"converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her brother, and keep","Pride and Prejudice"
"his house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming","Pride and Prejudice"
"neighbour in her.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced: their behaviour at","Pride and Prejudice"
"the assembly had not been calculated to please in general; and with more","Pride and Prejudice"
"quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"with a judgment, too, unassailed by any attention to herself, she was","Pride and Prejudice"
"very little disposed to approve them. They were, in fact, very fine","Pride and Prejudice"
"ladies; not deficient in good-humour when they were pleased, nor in the","Pride and Prejudice"
"power of being agreeable where they chose it; but proud and conceited.","Pride and Prejudice"
"They were rather handsome; had been educated in one of the first private","Pride and Prejudice"
"seminaries in town; had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds; were in the","Pride and Prejudice"
"habit of spending more than they ought, and of associating with people","Pride and Prejudice"
"of rank; and were, therefore, in every respect entitled to think well of","Pride and Prejudice"
"themselves and meanly of others. They were of a respectable family in","Pride and Prejudice"
"the north of England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their","Pride and Prejudice"
"memories than that their brother’s fortune and their own had been","Pride and Prejudice"
"acquired by trade.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred","Pride and Prejudice"
"thousand pounds from his father, who had intended to purchase an estate,","Pride and Prejudice"
"but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it likewise, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"sometimes made choice of his county; but, as he was now provided with a","Pride and Prejudice"
"good house and the liberty of a manor, it was doubtful to many of those","Pride and Prejudice"
"who best knew the easiness of his temper, whether he might not spend the","Pride and Prejudice"
"remainder of his days at Netherfield, and leave the next generation to","Pride and Prejudice"
"purchase.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"His sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own; but","Pride and Prejudice"
"though he was now established only as a tenant, Miss Bingley was by no","Pride and Prejudice"
"means unwilling to preside at his table; nor was Mrs. Hurst, who had","Pride and Prejudice"
"married a man of more fashion than fortune, less disposed to consider","Pride and Prejudice"
"his house as her home when it suited her. Mr. Bingley had not been of","Pride and Prejudice"
"age two years when he was tempted, by an accidental recommendation, to","Pride and Prejudice"
"look at Netherfield House. He did look at it, and into it, for half an","Pride and Prejudice"
"hour; was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms, satisfied","Pride and Prejudice"
"with what the owner said in its praise, and took it immediately.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Between him and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in spite of a","Pride and Prejudice"
"great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to Darcy by the","Pride and Prejudice"
"easiness, openness, and ductility of his temper, though no disposition","Pride and Prejudice"
"could offer a greater contrast to his own, and though with his own he","Pride and Prejudice"
"never appeared dissatisfied. On the strength of Darcy’s regard, Bingley","Pride and Prejudice"
"had the firmest reliance, and of his judgment the highest opinion. In","Pride and Prejudice"
"understanding, Darcy was the superior. Bingley was by no means","Pride and Prejudice"
"deficient; but Darcy was clever. He was at the same time haughty,","Pride and Prejudice"
"reserved, and fastidious; and his manners, though well bred, were not","Pride and Prejudice"
"inviting. In that respect his friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley","Pride and Prejudice"
"was sure of being liked wherever he appeared; Darcy was continually","Pride and Prejudice"
"giving offence.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was sufficiently","Pride and Prejudice"
"characteristic. Bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier","Pride and Prejudice"
"girls in his life; everybody had been most kind and attentive to him;","Pride and Prejudice"
"there had been no formality, no stiffness; he had soon felt acquainted","Pride and Prejudice"
"with all the room; and as to Miss Bennet, he could not conceive an angel","Pride and Prejudice"
"more beautiful. Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people","Pride and Prejudice"
"in whom there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he had","Pride and Prejudice"
"felt the smallest interest, and from none received either attention or","Pride and Prejudice"
"pleasure. Miss Bennet he acknowledged to be pretty; but she smiled too","Pride and Prejudice"
"much.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mrs. Hurst and her sister allowed it to be so; but still they admired","Pride and Prejudice"
"her and liked her, and pronounced her to be a sweet girl, and one whom","Pride and Prejudice"

"Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the Bennets","Pride and Prejudice"
"were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been formerly in trade","Pride and Prejudice"
"in Meryton, where he had made a tolerable fortune, and risen to the","Pride and Prejudice"
"honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty. The","Pride and Prejudice"
"distinction had, perhaps, been felt too strongly. It had given him a","Pride and Prejudice"
"disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town;","Pride and Prejudice"
"and, quitting them both, he had removed with his family to a house about","Pride and Prejudice"
"a mile from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge; where he","Pride and Prejudice"
"could think with pleasure of his own importance, and, unshackled by","Pride and Prejudice"
"business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world. For,","Pride and Prejudice"
"though elated by his rank, it did not render him supercilious; on the","Pride and Prejudice"
"contrary, he was all attention to everybody. By nature inoffensive,","Pride and Prejudice"
"friendly, and obliging, his presentation at St. James’s had made him","Pride and Prejudice"
"courteous.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a","Pride and Prejudice"
"valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The eldest","Pride and Prejudice"
"of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about twenty-seven, was","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth’s intimate friend.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk over a","Pride and Prejudice"

"“Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him and Mr. Robinson: did not","Pride and Prejudice"

"women in the room, and _which_ he thought the prettiest? and his","Pride and Prejudice"
"answering immediately to the last question, ‘Oh, the eldest Miss Bennet,","Pride and Prejudice"

"“I beg you will not put it into Lizzy’s head to be vexed by his","Pride and Prejudice"

"often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot wonder that so","Pride and Prejudice"
"very fine a young man, with family, fortune, everything in his favour,","Pride and Prejudice"

"“Pride,” observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of her","Pride and Prejudice"

"nature is particularly prone to it, and that there are very few of us","Pride and Prejudice"
"who do not cherish a feeling of self-complacency on the score of some","Pride and Prejudice"
"quality or other, real or imaginary. Vanity and pride are different","Pride and Prejudice"
"things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be","Pride and Prejudice"

"“If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy,” cried a young Lucas, who came with his","Pride and Prejudice"

"on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be","Pride and Prejudice"
"so very guarded. If a woman conceals her affection with the same skill","Pride and Prejudice"
"from the object of it, she may lose the opportunity of fixing him; and","Pride and Prejudice"
"it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the","Pride and Prejudice"
"dark. There is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every","Pride and Prejudice"
"attachment, that it is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all","Pride and Prejudice"
"_begin_ freely--a slight preference is natural enough; but there are","Pride and Prejudice"
"very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without","Pride and Prejudice"
"encouragement. In nine cases out of ten, a woman had better show _more_","Pride and Prejudice"
"affection than she feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he","Pride and Prejudice"
"may never do more than like her, if she does not help him on.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“But she does help him on, as much as her nature will allow. If _I_ can","Pride and Prejudice"
"perceive her regard for him, he must be a simpleton indeed not to","Pride and Prejudice"
"discover it too.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Remember, Eliza, that he does not know Jane’s disposition as you do.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavor to conceal","Pride and Prejudice"
"it, he must find it out.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Perhaps he must, if he sees enough of her. But though Bingley and Jane","Pride and Prejudice"
"meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours together; and as they","Pride and Prejudice"
"always see each other in large mixed parties, it is impossible that","Pride and Prejudice"
"every moment should be employed in conversing together. Jane should","Pride and Prejudice"
"therefore make the most of every half hour in which she can command his","Pride and Prejudice"
"attention. When she is secure of him, there will be leisure for falling","Pride and Prejudice"
"in love as much as she chooses.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Your plan is a good one,” replied Elizabeth, “where nothing is in","Pride and Prejudice"
"question but the desire of being well married; and if I were determined","Pride and Prejudice"
"to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I should adopt it. But","Pride and Prejudice"
"these are not Jane’s feelings; she is not acting by design. As yet she","Pride and Prejudice"
"cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard, nor of its","Pride and Prejudice"
"reasonableness. She has known him only a fortnight. She danced four","Pride and Prejudice"
"dances with him at Meryton; she saw him one morning at his own house,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and has since dined in company with him four times. This is not quite","Pride and Prejudice"
"enough to make her understand his character.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Not as you represent it. Had she merely _dined_ with him, she might","Pride and Prejudice"
"only have discovered whether he had a good appetite; but you must","Pride and Prejudice"
"remember that four evenings have been also spent together--and four","Pride and Prejudice"
"evenings may do a great deal.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yes: these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both","Pride and Prejudice"
"like Vingt-un better than Commerce, but with respect to any other","Pride and Prejudice"
"leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has been unfolded.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Well,” said Charlotte, “I wish Jane success with all my heart; and if","Pride and Prejudice"
"she were married to him to-morrow, I should think she had as good a","Pride and Prejudice"
"chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a","Pride and Prejudice"
"twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance. If","Pride and Prejudice"
"the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other, or","Pride and Prejudice"
"ever so similar beforehand, it does not advance their felicity in the","Pride and Prejudice"
"least. They always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to","Pride and Prejudice"
"have their share of vexation; and it is better to know as little as","Pride and Prejudice"
"possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your","Pride and Prejudice"
"life.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it is not","Pride and Prejudice"
"sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley’s attention to her sister, Elizabeth","Pride and Prejudice"
"was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some","Pride and Prejudice"
"interest in the eyes of his friend. Mr. Darcy had at first scarcely","Pride and Prejudice"
"allowed her to be pretty: he had looked at her without admiration at the","Pride and Prejudice"
"ball; and when they next met, he looked at her only to criticise. But no","Pride and Prejudice"
"sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had","Pride and Prejudice"
"hardly a good feature in her face, than he began to find it was rendered","Pride and Prejudice"
"uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes. To","Pride and Prejudice"
"this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying. Though he had","Pride and Prejudice"
"detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry","Pride and Prejudice"
"in her form, he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and","Pride and Prejudice"
"pleasing; and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those","Pride and Prejudice"
"of the fashionable world, he was caught by their easy playfulness. Of","Pride and Prejudice"
"this she was perfectly unaware: to her he was only the man who made","Pride and Prejudice"
"himself agreeable nowhere, and who had not thought her handsome enough","Pride and Prejudice"
"to dance with.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"He began to wish to know more of her; and, as a step towards conversing","Pride and Prejudice"
"with her himself, attended to her conversation with others. His doing so","Pride and Prejudice"
"drew her notice. It was at Sir William Lucas’s, where a large party were","Pride and Prejudice"
"assembled.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“What does Mr. Darcy mean,” said she to Charlotte, “by listening to my","Pride and Prejudice"
"conversation with Colonel Forster?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“But if he does it any more, I shall certainly let him know that I see","Pride and Prejudice"
"what he is about. He has a very satirical eye, and if I do not begin by","Pride and Prejudice"

"Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with","Pride and Prejudice"

"much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas","Pride and Prejudice"
"was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There is","Pride and Prejudice"
"nothing like dancing, after all. I consider it as one of the first","Pride and Prejudice"
"refinements of polished societies.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst","Pride and Prejudice"
"the less polished societies of the world: every savage can dance.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Sir William only smiled. “Your friend performs delightfully,” he","Pride and Prejudice"
"continued, after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; “and I doubt","Pride and Prejudice"
"not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Never, sir.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You have a house in town, I conclude?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Darcy bowed.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself, for I am fond of","Pride and Prejudice"
"superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of","Pride and Prejudice"
"London would agree with Lady Lucas.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"He paused in hopes of an answer: but his companion was not disposed to","Pride and Prejudice"
"make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was","Pride and Prejudice"
"struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to","Pride and Prejudice"
"her,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allow","Pride and Prejudice"
"me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You","Pride and Prejudice"
"cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"And, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy, who, though","Pride and Prejudice"
"extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly","Pride and Prejudice"
"drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you","Pride and Prejudice"
"not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me","Pride and Prejudice"

"“Mr. Darcy is all politeness,” said Elizabeth, smiling.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not injured","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I can guess the subject of your reverie.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I should imagine not.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many","Pride and Prejudice"
"evenings in this manner,--in such society; and, indeed, I am quite of","Pride and Prejudice"
"your opinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the","Pride and Prejudice"

"people! What would I give to hear your strictures on them!”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more","Pride and Prejudice"

"which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he","Pride and Prejudice"

"Mr. Darcy replied, with great intrepidity,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Miss Elizabeth Bennet.”","Pride and Prejudice"

"“Miss Elizabeth Bennet!” repeated Miss Bingley. “I am all astonishment.","Pride and Prejudice"

"joy?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady’s","Pride and Prejudice"

"“Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"[Illustration]","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Bennet’s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two","Pride and Prejudice"
"thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,","Pride and Prejudice"
"in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply","Pride and Prejudice"
"the deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"had left her four thousand pounds.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She had a sister married to a Mr. Philips, who had been a clerk to their","Pride and Prejudice"
"father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in","Pride and Prejudice"
"London in a respectable line of trade.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most","Pride and Prejudice"
"convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted","Pride and Prejudice"
"thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"to a milliner’s shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family,","Pride and Prejudice"
"Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions:","Pride and Prejudice"
"their minds were more vacant than their sisters’, and when nothing","Pride and Prejudice"
"better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning","Pride and Prejudice"
"hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and, however bare of","Pride and Prejudice"
"news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn","Pride and Prejudice"
"some from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both","Pride and Prejudice"
"with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in","Pride and Prejudice"
"the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was","Pride and Prejudice"
"the head-quarters.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Their visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most interesting","Pride and Prejudice"
"intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge of the","Pride and Prejudice"
"officers’ names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a secret,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr. Philips","Pride and Prejudice"
"visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity","Pride and Prejudice"
"unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bingley’s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their","Pride and Prejudice"
"mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of","Pride and Prejudice"
"an ensign.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bennet coolly observed,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two","Pride and Prejudice"
"of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but","Pride and Prejudice"
"I am now convinced.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect","Pride and Prejudice"
"indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the","Pride and Prejudice"
"next morning to London.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I am astonished, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that you should be so","Pride and Prejudice"
"ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly","Pride and Prejudice"
"of anybody’s children, it should not be of my own, however.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yes; but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I","Pride and Prejudice"
"had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must","Pride and Prejudice"
"so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly","Pride and Prejudice"
"foolish.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of","Pride and Prejudice"
"their father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they will","Pride and Prejudice"
"not think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when I","Pride and Prejudice"
"liked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so I do still at my","Pride and Prejudice"
"heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year,","Pride and Prejudice"
"should want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought","Pride and Prejudice"
"Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William’s in","Pride and Prejudice"
"his regimentals.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Mamma,” cried Lydia, “my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain","Pride and Prejudice"
"Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson’s as they did when they first","Pride and Prejudice"
"came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke’s library.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a","Pride and Prejudice"
"note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited","Pride and Prejudice"
"for an answer. Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was","Pride and Prejudice"
"eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well,","Pride and Prejudice"
"Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.”","Pride and Prejudice"

"“Dining out,” said Mrs. Bennet; “that is very unlucky.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Can I have the carriage?” said Jane.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems likely to","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“That would be a good scheme,” said Elizabeth, “if you were sure that","Pride and Prejudice"

"“I had much rather go in the coach.”","Pride and Prejudice"

"wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are not they?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"[Illustration: Cheerful prognostics]","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them.”","Pride and Prejudice"

"“But if you have got them to-day,” said Elizabeth, “my mother’s purpose","Pride and Prejudice"
"will be answered.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses","Pride and Prejudice"
"were engaged; Jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback, and her","Pride and Prejudice"
"mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad","Pride and Prejudice"

"rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was","Pride and Prejudice"
"delighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;","Pride and Prejudice"
"Jane certainly could not come back.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!” said Mrs. Bennet, more than","Pride and Prejudice"
"once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the next","Pride and Prejudice"
"morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her","Pride and Prejudice"
"contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield","Pride and Prejudice"
"brought the following note for Elizabeth:--","Pride and Prejudice"

"     /* NIND “My dearest Lizzie, */","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"     “I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be","Pride and Prejudice"
"     imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends will","Pride and Prejudice"
"     not hear of my returning home till I am better. They insist also on","Pride and Prejudice"
"     my seeing Mr. Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear","Pride and Prejudice"
"     of his having been to me--and, excepting a sore throat and a","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yours, etc.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Well, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note","Pride and Prejudice"
"aloud, “if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness--if she","Pride and Prejudice"

"Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Oh, I am not at all afraid of her dying. People do not die of little","Pride and Prejudice"
"trifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays","Pride and Prejudice"
"there, it is all very well. I would go and see her if I could have the","Pride and Prejudice"
"carriage.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, determined to go to her, though the","Pride and Prejudice"
"carriage was not to be had: and as she was no horsewoman, walking was","Pride and Prejudice"
"her only alternative. She declared her resolution.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“How can you be so silly,” cried her mother, “as to think of such a","Pride and Prejudice"

"“Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,” said her father, “to send for the","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“No, indeed. I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing,","Pride and Prejudice"

"“I admire the activity of your benevolence,” observed Mary, “but every","Pride and Prejudice"

"In Meryton they parted: the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one","Pride and Prejudice"
"of the officers’ wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing","Pride and Prejudice"
"field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing","Pride and Prejudice"
"over puddles, with impatient activity, and finding herself at last","Pride and Prejudice"
"within view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face","Pride and Prejudice"
"glowing with the warmth of exercise.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She was shown into the breakfast parlour, where all but Jane were","Pride and Prejudice"
"assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.","Pride and Prejudice"
"That she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such","Pride and Prejudice"
"dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and","Pride and Prejudice"
"Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt","Pride and Prejudice"
"for it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their","Pride and Prejudice"
"brother’s manners there was something better than politeness--there was","Pride and Prejudice"
"good-humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst","Pride and Prejudice"
"nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the","Pride and Prejudice"
"brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to","Pride and Prejudice"
"the occasion’s justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was","Pride and Prejudice"
"thinking only of his breakfast.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well","Pride and Prejudice"
"enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her","Pride and Prejudice"
"immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving","Pride and Prejudice"
"alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed","Pride and Prejudice"
"for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal,","Pride and Prejudice"
"however, to much conversation; and when Miss Bingley left them together,","Pride and Prejudice"
"could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the","Pride and Prejudice"
"extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended","Pride and Prejudice"
"her.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth","Pride and Prejudice"
"began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and","Pride and Prejudice"
"solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came; and having","Pride and Prejudice"
"examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a","Pride and Prejudice"
"violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;","Pride and Prejudice"
"advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice","Pride and Prejudice"
"was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head","Pride and Prejudice"
"ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were","Pride and Prejudice"
"the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact","Pride and Prejudice"
"nothing to do elsewhere.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very","Pride and Prejudice"
"unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only","Pride and Prejudice"
"wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern","Pride and Prejudice"
"at parting with her that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer","Pride and Prejudice"
"of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the","Pride and Prejudice"
"present. Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was","Pride and Prejudice"
"despatched to Longbourn, to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring","Pride and Prejudice"
"back a supply of clothes.","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"At five o’clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then","Pride and Prejudice"
"poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the","Pride and Prejudice"
"much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley, she could not make a very","Pride and Prejudice"
"favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing","Pride and Prejudice"
"this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how","Pride and Prejudice"
"shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked","Pride and Prejudice"
"being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their","Pride and Prejudice"
"indifference towards Jane, when not immediately before them, restored","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could","Pride and Prejudice"
"regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his","Pride and Prejudice"
"attentions to herself most pleasing; and they prevented her feeling","Pride and Prejudice"
"herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the","Pride and Prejudice"
"others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was","Pride and Prejudice"
"engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to","Pride and Prejudice"
"eat, drink, and play at cards, who, when he found her prefer a plain","Pride and Prejudice"
"dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley","Pride and Prejudice"
"began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were","Pride and Prejudice"
"pronounced to be very bad indeed,--a mixture of pride and impertinence:","Pride and Prejudice"
"she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst","Pride and Prejudice"
"thought the same, and added,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent","Pride and Prejudice"
"walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really","Pride and Prejudice"
"looked almost wild.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“She did indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very","Pride and Prejudice"
"nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the","Pride and Prejudice"
"country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair so untidy, so blowzy!”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep","Pride and Prejudice"
"in mud, I am absolutely certain, and the gown which had been let down to","Pride and Prejudice"
"hide it not doing its office.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,” said Bingley; “but this was","Pride and Prejudice"
"all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well","Pride and Prejudice"
"when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite","Pride and Prejudice"
"escaped my notice.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley; “and I am","Pride and Prejudice"
"inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such","Pride and Prejudice"
"an exhibition.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Certainly not.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,","Pride and Prejudice"
"above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by","Pride and Prejudice"
"it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,","Pride and Prejudice"
"a most country-town indifference to decorum.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,” said","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bingley.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,” observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper,","Pride and Prejudice"
"“that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine","Pride and Prejudice"
"eyes.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Not at all,” he replied: “they were brightened by the exercise.” A","Pride and Prejudice"
"short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I have an excessive regard for Jane Bennet,--she is really a very sweet","Pride and Prejudice"
"girl,--and I wish with all my heart she were well settled. But with such","Pride and Prejudice"
"a father and mother, and such low connections, I am afraid there is no","Pride and Prejudice"
"chance of it.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in","Pride and Prejudice"
"Meryton?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“That is capital,” added her sister; and they both laughed heartily.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,” cried Bingley, “it","Pride and Prejudice"
"would not make them one jot less agreeable.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men of any","Pride and Prejudice"
"consideration in the world,” replied Darcy.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his sisters gave it their","Pride and Prejudice"
"hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at the expense of","Pride and Prejudice"
"their dear friend’s vulgar relations.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"With a renewal of tenderness, however, they repaired to her room on","Pride and Prejudice"
"leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her till summoned to coffee.","Pride and Prejudice"
"She was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit her at all, till","Pride and Prejudice"
"late in the evening, when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go","Pride and Prejudice"
"down stairs herself. On entering the drawing-room, she found the whole","Pride and Prejudice"
"party at loo, and was immediately invited to join them; but suspecting","Pride and Prejudice"
"them to be playing high, she declined it, and making her sister the","Pride and Prejudice"
"excuse, said she would amuse herself, for the short time she could stay","Pride and Prejudice"
"below, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her with astonishment.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Do you prefer reading to cards?” said he; “that is rather singular.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Miss Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, “despises cards. She is a great","Pride and Prejudice"
"reader, and has no pleasure in anything else.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,” cried Elizabeth; “I","Pride and Prejudice"
"am _not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in many things.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,” said Bingley; “and","Pride and Prejudice"
"I hope it will soon be increased by seeing her quite well.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth thanked him from her heart, and then walked towards a table","Pride and Prejudice"
"where a few books were lying. He immediately offered to fetch her","Pride and Prejudice"
"others; all that his library afforded.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own","Pride and Prejudice"
"credit; but I am an idle fellow; and though I have not many, I have more","Pride and Prejudice"
"than I ever looked into.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth assured him that she could suit herself perfectly with those","Pride and Prejudice"
"in the room.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I am astonished,” said Miss Bingley, “that my father should have left","Pride and Prejudice"
"so small a collection of books. What a delightful library you have at","Pride and Prejudice"
"Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“It ought to be good,” he replied: “it has been the work of many","Pride and Prejudice"
"generations.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“And then you have added so much to it yourself--you are always buying","Pride and Prejudice"
"books.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days as","Pride and Prejudice"
"these.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the beauties of","Pride and Prejudice"
"that noble place. Charles, when you build _your_ house, I wish it may be","Pride and Prejudice"
"half as delightful as Pemberley.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I wish it may.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that","Pride and Prejudice"
"neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is not a","Pride and Prejudice"
"finer county in England than Derbyshire.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“With all my heart: I will buy Pemberley itself, if Darcy will sell it.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I am talking of possibilities, Charles.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get","Pride and Prejudice"
"Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth was so much caught by what passed, as to leave her very little","Pride and Prejudice"
"attention for her book; and, soon laying it wholly aside, she drew near","Pride and Prejudice"
"the card-table, and stationed herself between Mr. Bingley and his eldest","Pride and Prejudice"
"sister, to observe the game.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?” said Miss Bingley: “will","Pride and Prejudice"
"she be as tall as I am?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I think she will. She is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet’s height, or","Pride and Prejudice"
"rather taller.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“How I long to see her again! I never met with anybody who delighted me","Pride and Prejudice"
"so much. Such a countenance, such manners, and so extremely accomplished","Pride and Prejudice"
"for her age! Her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“It is amazing to me,” said Bingley, “how young ladies can have patience","Pride and Prejudice"
"to be so very accomplished as they all are.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you mean?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"net purses. I scarcely know any one who cannot do all this; and I am","Pride and Prejudice"
"sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time, without","Pride and Prejudice"
"being informed that she was very accomplished.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,” said Darcy, “has","Pride and Prejudice"
"too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no","Pride and Prejudice"
"otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen; but I am very","Pride and Prejudice"
"far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general. I","Pride and Prejudice"
"cannot boast of knowing more than half-a-dozen in the whole range of my","Pride and Prejudice"
"acquaintance that are really accomplished.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Nor I, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Then,” observed Elizabeth, “you must comprehend a great deal in your","Pride and Prejudice"
"idea of an accomplished woman.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yes; I do comprehend a great deal in it.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Oh, certainly,” cried his faithful assistant, “no one can be really","Pride and Prejudice"
"esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met","Pride and Prejudice"
"with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of music, singing, drawing,","Pride and Prejudice"
"dancing, and the modern languages, to deserve the word; and, besides all","Pride and Prejudice"
"this, she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of","Pride and Prejudice"
"walking, the tone of her voice, her address and expressions, or the word","Pride and Prejudice"
"will be but half deserved.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“All this she must possess,” added Darcy; “and to all she must yet add","Pride and Prejudice"
"something more substantial in the improvement of her mind by extensive","Pride and Prejudice"
"reading.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished women.","Pride and Prejudice"
"I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility of all","Pride and Prejudice"
"this?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“_I_ never saw such a woman. _I_ never saw such capacity, and taste, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"application, and elegance, as you describe, united.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice of her","Pride and Prejudice"
"implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew many women who","Pride and Prejudice"
"answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called them to order, with","Pride and Prejudice"
"bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward. As all","Pride and Prejudice"
"conversation was thereby at an end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the","Pride and Prejudice"
"room.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Eliza Bennet,” said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed on her, “is","Pride and Prejudice"
"one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other","Pride and Prejudice"
"sex by undervaluing their own; and with many men, I daresay, it","Pride and Prejudice"
"succeeds; but, in my opinion, it is a paltry device, a very mean art.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Undoubtedly,” replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly addressed,","Pride and Prejudice"
"“there is meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies sometimes condescend","Pride and Prejudice"
"to employ for captivation. Whatever bears affinity to cunning is","Pride and Prejudice"
"despicable.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to","Pride and Prejudice"
"continue the subject.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"that she could not leave her. Bingley urged Mr. Jones’s being sent for","Pride and Prejudice"
"immediately; while his sisters, convinced that no country advice could","Pride and Prejudice"
"be of any service, recommended an express to town for one of the most","Pride and Prejudice"
"eminent physicians. This she would not hear of; but she was not so","Pride and Prejudice"
"unwilling to comply with their brother’s proposal; and it was settled","Pride and Prejudice"
"that Mr. Jones should be sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet","Pride and Prejudice"
"were not decidedly better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his sisters","Pride and Prejudice"
"declared that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,","Pride and Prejudice"
"however, by duets after supper; while he could find no better relief to","Pride and Prejudice"
"his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every","Pride and Prejudice"
"possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister.","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sister’s room, and in the","Pride and Prejudice"
"morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the","Pride and Prejudice"
"inquiries which she very early received from Mr. Bingley by a housemaid,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his","Pride and Prejudice"
"sisters. In spite of this amendment, however, she requested to have a","Pride and Prejudice"
"note sent to Longbourn, desiring her mother to visit Jane, and form her","Pride and Prejudice"
"own judgment of her situation. The note was immediately despatched, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet, accompanied by her","Pride and Prejudice"
"two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon after the family breakfast.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Had she found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have been","Pride and Prejudice"
"very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was","Pride and Prejudice"
"not alarming, she had no wish of her recovering immediately, as her","Pride and Prejudice"
"restoration to health would probably remove her from Netherfield. She","Pride and Prejudice"
"would not listen, therefore, to her daughter’s proposal of being carried","Pride and Prejudice"
"home; neither did the apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think","Pride and Prejudice"
"it at all advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bingley’s appearance and invitation, the mother and three daughters all","Pride and Prejudice"
"attended her into the breakfast parlour. Bingley met them with hopes","Pride and Prejudice"
"that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet worse than she expected.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Indeed I have, sir,” was her answer. “She is a great deal too ill to be","Pride and Prejudice"
"moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her. We must trespass","Pride and Prejudice"
"a little longer on your kindness.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Removed!” cried Bingley. “It must not be thought of. My sister, I am","Pride and Prejudice"
"sure, will not hear of her removal.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You may depend upon it, madam,” said Miss Bingley, with cold civility,","Pride and Prejudice"
"“that Miss Bennet shall receive every possible attention while she","Pride and Prejudice"
"remains with us.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her acknowledgments.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I am sure,” she added, “if it was not for such good friends, I do not","Pride and Prejudice"
"know what would become of her, for she is very ill indeed, and suffers a","Pride and Prejudice"
"vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the world, which is","Pride and Prejudice"
"always the way with her, for she has, without exception, the sweetest","Pride and Prejudice"
"temper I ever met with. I often tell my other girls they are nothing to","Pride and Prejudice"
"_her_. You have a sweet room here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect","Pride and Prejudice"
"over that gravel walk. I do not know a place in the country that is","Pride and Prejudice"
"equal to Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I","Pride and Prejudice"
"hope, though you have but a short lease.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Whatever I do is done in a hurry,” replied he; “and therefore if I","Pride and Prejudice"
"should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in five","Pride and Prejudice"
"minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite fixed here.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,” said Elizabeth.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You begin to comprehend me, do you?” cried he, turning towards her.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Oh yes--I understand you perfectly.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily seen","Pride and Prejudice"
"through, I am afraid, is pitiful.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“That is as it happens. It does not necessarily follow that a deep,","Pride and Prejudice"
"intricate character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Lizzy,” cried her mother, “remember where you are, and do not run on in","Pride and Prejudice"
"the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I did not know before,” continued Bingley, immediately, “that you were","Pride and Prejudice"
"a studier of character. It must be an amusing study.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yes; but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have at","Pride and Prejudice"
"least that advantage.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“The country,” said Darcy, “can in general supply but few subjects for","Pride and Prejudice"
"such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in a very confined and","Pride and Prejudice"
"unvarying society.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new to be","Pride and Prejudice"
"observed in them for ever.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yes, indeed,” cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his manner of mentioning a","Pride and Prejudice"
"country neighbourhood. “I assure you there is quite as much of _that_","Pride and Prejudice"
"going on in the country as in town.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Everybody was surprised; and Darcy, after looking at her for a moment,","Pride and Prejudice"
"turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she had gained a complete","Pride and Prejudice"
"victory over him, continued her triumph,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the country, for","Pride and Prejudice"
"my part, except the shops and public places. The country is a vast deal","Pride and Prejudice"
"pleasanter, is not it, Mr. Bingley?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“When I am in the country,” he replied, “I never wish to leave it; and","Pride and Prejudice"
"when I am in town, it is pretty much the same. They have each their","Pride and Prejudice"
"advantages, and I can be equally happy in either.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Ay, that is because you have the right disposition. But that","Pride and Prejudice"
"gentleman,” looking at Darcy, “seemed to think the country was nothing","Pride and Prejudice"
"at all.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Indeed, mamma, you are mistaken,” said Elizabeth, blushing for her","Pride and Prejudice"
"mother. “You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He only meant that there was not","Pride and Prejudice"
"such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town, which","Pride and Prejudice"
"you must acknowledge to be true.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not meeting with","Pride and Prejudice"
"many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there are few","Pride and Prejudice"
"neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with four-and-twenty families.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep his","Pride and Prejudice"
"countenance. His sister was less delicate, and directed her eye towards","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth, for the sake of","Pride and Prejudice"
"saying something that might turn her mother’s thoughts, now asked her if","Pride and Prejudice"
"Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn since _her_ coming away.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yes, she called yesterday with her father. What an agreeable man Sir","Pride and Prejudice"
"William is, Mr. Bingley--is not he? so much the man of fashion! so","Pride and Prejudice"
"genteel and so easy! He has always something to say to everybody. _That_","Pride and Prejudice"
"is my idea of good breeding; and those persons who fancy themselves very","Pride and Prejudice"
"important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Did Charlotte dine with you?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“No, she would go home. I fancy she was wanted about the mince-pies. For","Pride and Prejudice"
"my part, Mr. Bingley, _I_ always keep servants that can do their own","Pride and Prejudice"
"work; _my_ daughters are brought up differently. But everybody is to","Pride and Prejudice"
"judge for themselves, and the Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I","Pride and Prejudice"
"assure you. It is a pity they are not handsome! Not that _I_ think","Pride and Prejudice"

"“She seems a very pleasant young woman,” said Bingley.","Pride and Prejudice"

"“Oh dear, yes; but you must own she is very plain. Lady Lucas herself","Pride and Prejudice"
"has often said so, and envied me Jane’s beauty. I do not like to boast","Pride and Prejudice"
"of my own child; but to be sure, Jane--one does not often see anybody","Pride and Prejudice"
"better looking. It is what everybody says. I do not trust my own","Pride and Prejudice"
"partiality. When she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my","Pride and Prejudice"
"brother Gardiner’s in town so much in love with her, that my","Pride and Prejudice"
"sister-in-law was sure he would make her an offer before we came away.","Pride and Prejudice"
"But, however, he did not. Perhaps he thought her too young. However, he","Pride and Prejudice"
"wrote some verses on her, and very pretty they were.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“And so ended his affection,” said Elizabeth, impatiently. “There has","Pride and Prejudice"
"been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder who first","Pride and Prejudice"
"discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love!”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,” said Darcy.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what is","Pride and Prejudice"
"strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I","Pride and Prejudice"
"am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made Elizabeth","Pride and Prejudice"
"tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again. She longed to","Pride and Prejudice"
"speak, but could think of nothing to say; and after a short silence Mrs.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bennet began repeating her thanks to Mr. Bingley for his kindness to","Pride and Prejudice"
"Jane, with an apology for troubling him also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was","Pride and Prejudice"
"unaffectedly civil in his answer, and forced his younger sister to be","Pride and Prejudice"
"civil also, and say what the occasion required. She performed her part,","Pride and Prejudice"
"indeed, without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"soon afterwards ordered her carriage. Upon this signal, the youngest of","Pride and Prejudice"
"her daughters put herself forward. The two girls had been whispering to","Pride and Prejudice"
"each other during the whole visit; and the result of it was, that the","Pride and Prejudice"
"youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with having promised on his first coming","Pride and Prejudice"
"into the country to give a ball at Netherfield.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine complexion","Pride and Prejudice"
"and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her mother, whose","Pride and Prejudice"
"affection had brought her into public at an early age. She had high","Pride and Prejudice"
"animal spirits, and a sort of natural self-consequence, which the","Pride and Prejudice"
"attentions of the officers, to whom her uncle’s good dinners and her","Pride and Prejudice"
"own easy manners recommended her, had increased into assurance. She was","Pride and Prejudice"
"very equal, therefore, to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the","Pride and Prejudice"
"ball, and abruptly reminded him of his promise; adding, that it would be","Pride and Prejudice"
"the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it. His answer","Pride and Prejudice"
"to this sudden attack was delightful to her mother’s ear.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and, when","Pride and Prejudice"
"your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the very day of","Pride and Prejudice"
"the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Lydia declared herself satisfied. “Oh yes--it would be much better to","Pride and Prejudice"
"wait till Jane was well; and by that time, most likely, Captain Carter","Pride and Prejudice"
"would be at Meryton again. And when you have given _your_ ball,” she","Pride and Prejudice"
"added, “I shall insist on their giving one also. I shall tell Colonel","Pride and Prejudice"
"Forster it will be quite a shame if he does not.”","Pride and Prejudice"

"The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and Miss","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid, who","Pride and Prejudice"
"continued, though slowly, to mend; and, in the evening, Elizabeth joined","Pride and Prejudice"
"their party in the drawing-room. The loo table, however, did not appear.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Darcy was writing, and Miss Bingley, seated near him, was watching","Pride and Prejudice"
"the progress of his letter, and repeatedly calling off his attention by","Pride and Prejudice"
"messages to his sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mrs. Hurst was observing their game.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in","Pride and Prejudice"
"attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion. The perpetual","Pride and Prejudice"
"commendations of the lady either on his hand-writing, or on the evenness","Pride and Prejudice"
"of his lines, or on the length of his letter, with the perfect unconcern","Pride and Prejudice"
"with which her praises were received, formed a curious dialogue, and was","Pride and Prejudice"
"exactly in unison with her opinion of each.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"He made no answer.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You write uncommonly fast.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You are mistaken. I write rather slowly.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course of a","Pride and Prejudice"
"year! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think them!”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of to yours.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Pray tell your sister that I long to see her.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I have already told her so once, by your desire.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"

"“Thank you--but I always mend my own.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“How can you contrive to write so even?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"He was silent.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp,","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again? At","Pride and Prejudice"
"present I have not room to do them justice.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Oh, it is of no consequence. I shall see her in January. But do you","Pride and Prejudice"
"always write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“They are generally long; but whether always charming, it is not for me","Pride and Prejudice"
"to determine.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter with","Pride and Prejudice"
"ease cannot write ill.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,” cried her","Pride and Prejudice"
"brother, “because he does _not_ write with ease. He studies too much","Pride and Prejudice"
"for words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“My style of writing is very different from yours.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Oh,” cried Miss Bingley, “Charles writes in the most careless way","Pride and Prejudice"
"imaginable. He leaves out half his words, and blots the rest.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them; by which","Pride and Prejudice"
"means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my correspondents.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Your humility, Mr. Bingley,” said Elizabeth, “must disarm reproof.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Nothing is more deceitful,” said Darcy, “than the appearance of","Pride and Prejudice"
"humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes an","Pride and Prejudice"
"indirect boast.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of modesty?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in","Pride and Prejudice"
"writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of","Pride and Prejudice"
"thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not estimable, you","Pride and Prejudice"
"think at least highly interesting. The power of doing anything with","Pride and Prejudice"
"quickness is always much prized by the possessor, and often without any","Pride and Prejudice"
"attention to the imperfection of the performance. When you told Mrs.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bennet this morning, that if you ever resolved on quitting Netherfield","Pride and Prejudice"
"you should be gone in five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of","Pride and Prejudice"
"panegyric, of compliment to yourself; and yet what is there so very","Pride and Prejudice"
"laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business","Pride and Prejudice"
"undone, and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Nay,” cried Bingley, “this is too much, to remember at night all the","Pride and Prejudice"
"foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon my honour, I","Pride and Prejudice"
"believed what I said of myself to be true, and I believe it at this","Pride and Prejudice"
"moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume the character of needless","Pride and Prejudice"
"precipitance merely to show off before the ladies.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I daresay you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that you","Pride and Prejudice"
"would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite as","Pride and Prejudice"
"dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you were","Pride and Prejudice"
"mounting your horse, a friend were to say, ‘Bingley, you had better stay","Pride and Prejudice"
"till next week,’ you would probably do it--you would probably not","Pride and Prejudice"
"go--and, at another word, might stay a month.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You have only proved by this,” cried Elizabeth, “that Mr. Bingley did","Pride and Prejudice"
"not do justice to his own disposition. You have shown him off now much","Pride and Prejudice"
"more than he did himself.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I am exceedingly gratified,” said Bingley, “by your converting what my","Pride and Prejudice"
"friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper. But I am","Pride and Prejudice"
"afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means","Pride and Prejudice"
"intend; for he would certainly think the better of me if, under such a","Pride and Prejudice"
"circumstance, I were to give a flat denial, and ride off as fast as I","Pride and Prejudice"
"could.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original intention","Pride and Prejudice"
"as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter--Darcy must speak for","Pride and Prejudice"
"himself.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine,","Pride and Prejudice"
"but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case, however, to","Pride and Prejudice"
"stand according to your representation, you must remember, Miss Bennet,","Pride and Prejudice"
"that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"the delay of his plan, has merely desired it, asked it without offering","Pride and Prejudice"
"one argument in favour of its propriety.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“To yield readily--easily--to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no merit","Pride and Prejudice"
"with you.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“To yield without conviction is no compliment to the understanding of","Pride and Prejudice"
"either.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence of","Pride and Prejudice"
"friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would often make","Pride and Prejudice"
"one readily yield to a request, without waiting for arguments to reason","Pride and Prejudice"
"one into it. I am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have","Pride and Prejudice"
"supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as well wait, perhaps, till the","Pride and Prejudice"
"circumstance occurs, before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour","Pride and Prejudice"
"thereupon. But in general and ordinary cases, between friend and friend,","Pride and Prejudice"
"where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no","Pride and Prejudice"
"very great moment, should you think ill of that person for complying","Pride and Prejudice"
"with the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to arrange","Pride and Prejudice"
"with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to","Pride and Prejudice"
"appertain to this request, as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting","Pride and Prejudice"
"between the parties?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“By all means,” cried Bingley; “let us hear all the particulars, not","Pride and Prejudice"
"forgetting their comparative height and size, for that will have more","Pride and Prejudice"
"weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be aware of. I assure","Pride and Prejudice"
"you that if Darcy were not such a great tall fellow, in comparison with","Pride and Prejudice"
"myself, I should not pay him half so much deference. I declare I do not","Pride and Prejudice"
"know a more awful object than Darcy on particular occasions, and in","Pride and Prejudice"
"particular places; at his own house especially, and of a Sunday evening,","Pride and Prejudice"
"when he has nothing to do.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was","Pride and Prejudice"
"rather offended, and therefore checked her laugh. Miss Bingley warmly","Pride and Prejudice"
"resented the indignity he had received, in an expostulation with her","Pride and Prejudice"
"brother for talking such nonsense.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I see your design, Bingley,” said his friend. “You dislike an argument,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and want to silence this.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and Miss","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall be very","Pride and Prejudice"
"thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“What you ask,” said Elizabeth, “is no sacrifice on my side; and Mr.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Darcy had much better finish his letter.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Darcy took her advice, and did finish his letter.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"When that business was over, he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth","Pride and Prejudice"
"for the indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved with alacrity to","Pride and Prejudice"
"the pianoforte, and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the","Pride and Prejudice"
"way, which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived, she","Pride and Prejudice"
"seated herself.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mrs. Hurst sang with her sister; and while they were thus employed,","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth could not help observing, as she turned over some music-books","Pride and Prejudice"
"that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr. Darcy’s eyes were fixed","Pride and Prejudice"
"on her. She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of","Pride and Prejudice"
"admiration to so great a man, and yet that he should look at her because","Pride and Prejudice"
"he disliked her was still more strange. She could only imagine, however,","Pride and Prejudice"
"at last, that she drew his notice because there was something about her","Pride and Prejudice"
"more wrong and reprehensible, according to his ideas of right, than in","Pride and Prejudice"
"any other person present. The supposition did not pain her. She liked","Pride and Prejudice"
"him too little to care for his approbation.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm by a","Pride and Prejudice"
"lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing near","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth, said to her,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Do you not feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such an","Pride and Prejudice"
"opportunity of dancing a reel?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She smiled, but made no answer. He repeated the question, with some","Pride and Prejudice"
"surprise at her silence.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Oh,” said she, “I heard you before; but I could not immediately","Pride and Prejudice"
"determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say ‘Yes,’","Pride and Prejudice"
"that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always","Pride and Prejudice"
"delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of","Pride and Prejudice"
"their premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell","Pride and Prejudice"
"you that I do not want to dance a reel at all; and now despise me if you","Pride and Prejudice"
"dare.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Indeed I do not dare.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him, was amazed at his","Pride and Prejudice"
"gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her","Pride and Prejudice"
"manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody, and Darcy had","Pride and Prejudice"
"never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her. He really","Pride and Prejudice"
"believed that, were it not for the inferiority of her connections, he","Pride and Prejudice"
"should be in some danger.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Miss Bingley saw, or suspected, enough to be jealous; and her great","Pride and Prejudice"
"anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some","Pride and Prejudice"
"assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest, by talking of","Pride and Prejudice"
"their supposed marriage, and planning his happiness in such an alliance.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I hope,” said she, as they were walking together in the shrubbery the","Pride and Prejudice"
"next day, “you will give your mother-in-law a few hints, when this","Pride and Prejudice"
"desirable event takes place, as to the advantage of holding her tongue;","Pride and Prejudice"
"and if you can compass it, to cure the younger girls of running after","Pride and Prejudice"

"seeing her well guarded from cold, attended her into the drawing-room,","Pride and Prejudice"
"where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of","Pride and Prejudice"
"pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were","Pride and Prejudice"
"during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared. Their powers","Pride and Prejudice"
"of conversation were considerable. They could describe an entertainment","Pride and Prejudice"
"with accuracy, relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first object;","Pride and Prejudice"
"Miss Bingley’s eyes were instantly turned towards Darcy, and she had","Pride and Prejudice"
"something to say to him before he had advanced many steps. He addressed","Pride and Prejudice"
"himself directly to Miss Bennet with a polite congratulation; Mr. Hurst","Pride and Prejudice"
"also made her a slight bow, and said he was “very glad;” but diffuseness","Pride and Prejudice"
"and warmth remained for Bingley’s salutation. He was full of joy and","Pride and Prejudice"
"attention. The first half hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she","Pride and Prejudice"
"should suffer from the change of room; and she removed, at his desire,","Pride and Prejudice"
"to the other side of the fireplace, that she might be farther from the","Pride and Prejudice"
"door. He then sat down by her, and talked scarcely to anyone else.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with great","Pride and Prejudice"
"delight.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"When tea was over Mr. Hurst reminded his sister-in-law of the","Pride and Prejudice"
"card-table--but in vain. She had obtained private intelligence that Mr.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Darcy did not wish for cards, and Mr. Hurst soon found even his open","Pride and Prejudice"
"petition rejected. She assured him that no one intended to play, and the","Pride and Prejudice"
"silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her. Mr.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Hurst had, therefore, nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the","Pride and Prejudice"
"sofas and go to sleep. Darcy took up a book. Miss Bingley did the same;","Pride and Prejudice"
"and Mrs. Hurst, principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and","Pride and Prejudice"
"rings, joined now and then in her brother’s conversation with Miss","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bennet.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Miss Bingley’s attention was quite as much engaged in watching Mr.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Darcy’s progress through _his_ book, as in reading her own; and she was","Pride and Prejudice"
"perpetually either making some inquiry, or looking at his page. She","Pride and Prejudice"
"could not win him, however, to any conversation; he merely answered her","Pride and Prejudice"
"question and read on. At length, quite exhausted by the attempt to be","Pride and Prejudice"
"amused with her own book, which she had only chosen because it was the","Pride and Prejudice"
"second volume of his, she gave a great yawn and said, “How pleasant it","Pride and Prejudice"
"is to spend an evening in this way! I declare, after all, there is no","Pride and Prejudice"
"enjoyment like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a","Pride and Prejudice"
"book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I have not","Pride and Prejudice"
"an excellent library.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"No one made any reply. She then yawned again, threw aside her book, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"cast her eyes round the room in quest of some amusement; when, hearing","Pride and Prejudice"
"her brother mentioning a ball to Miss Bennet, she turned suddenly","Pride and Prejudice"
"towards him and said,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“By the bye Charles, are you really serious in meditating a dance at","Pride and Prejudice"
"Netherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on it, to consult","Pride and Prejudice"
"the wishes of the present party; I am much mistaken if there are not","Pride and Prejudice"
"some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a","Pride and Prejudice"
"pleasure.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“If you mean Darcy,” cried her brother, “he may go to bed, if he","Pride and Prejudice"
"chooses, before it begins; but as for the ball, it is quite a settled","Pride and Prejudice"
"thing, and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup enough I shall send","Pride and Prejudice"
"round my cards.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I should like balls infinitely better,” she replied, “if they were","Pride and Prejudice"
"carried on in a different manner; but there is something insufferably","Pride and Prejudice"
"tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It would surely be much","Pride and Prejudice"
"more rational if conversation instead of dancing made the order of the","Pride and Prejudice"
"day.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say; but it would not be","Pride and Prejudice"
"near so much like a ball.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards got up and walked about","Pride and Prejudice"
"the room. Her figure was elegant, and she walked well; but Darcy, at","Pride and Prejudice"
"whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly studious. In the","Pride and Prejudice"
"desperation of her feelings, she resolved on one effort more; and,","Pride and Prejudice"
"turning to Elizabeth, said,--","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Not at all,” was her answer; “but, depend upon it, he means to be","Pride and Prejudice"

"Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy in","Pride and Prejudice"
"anything, and persevered, therefore, in requiring an explanation of his","Pride and Prejudice"
"two motives.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I have not the smallest objection to explaining them,” said he, as soon","Pride and Prejudice"
"as she allowed him to speak. “You either choose this method of passing","Pride and Prejudice"
"the evening because you are in each other’s confidence, and have secret","Pride and Prejudice"
"affairs to discuss, or because you are conscious that your figures","Pride and Prejudice"
"appear to the greatest advantage in walking: if the first, I should be","Pride and Prejudice"
"completely in your way; and if the second, I can admire you much better","Pride and Prejudice"
"as I sit by the fire.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Oh, shocking!” cried Miss Bingley. “I never heard anything so","Pride and Prejudice"
"abominable. How shall we punish him for such a speech?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,” said Elizabeth. “We","Pride and Prejudice"
"can all plague and punish one another. Tease him--laugh at him. Intimate","Pride and Prejudice"
"as you are, you must know how it is to be done.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“But upon my honour I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy has not","Pride and Prejudice"
"yet taught me _that_. Tease calmness of temper and presence of mind! No,","Pride and Prejudice"
"no; I feel he may defy us there. And as to laughter, we will not expose","Pride and Prejudice"
"ourselves, if you please, by attempting to laugh without a subject. Mr.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Darcy may hug himself.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!” cried Elizabeth. “That is an","Pride and Prejudice"

"be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintance. I dearly love a","Pride and Prejudice"

"be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a","Pride and Prejudice"
"joke.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Certainly,” replied Elizabeth, “there are such people, but I hope I am","Pride and Prejudice"
"not one of _them_. I hope I never ridicule what is wise or good. Follies","Pride and Prejudice"
"and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_ divert me, I own, and I","Pride and Prejudice"
"laugh at them whenever I can. But these, I suppose, are precisely what","Pride and Prejudice"
"you are without.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the study of","Pride and Prejudice"
"my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a strong","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Such as vanity and pride.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride--where there is a real","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He owns it","Pride and Prejudice"
"himself without disguise.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“No,” said Darcy, “I have made no such pretension. I have faults enough,","Pride and Prejudice"
"but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I dare not vouch","Pride and Prejudice"
"for. It is, I believe, too little yielding; certainly too little for the","Pride and Prejudice"
"convenience of the world. I cannot forget the follies and vices of","Pride and Prejudice"
"others so soon as I ought, nor their offences against myself. My","Pride and Prejudice"
"feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them. My temper","Pride and Prejudice"
"would perhaps be called resentful. My good opinion once lost is lost for","Pride and Prejudice"
"ever.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“_That_ is a failing, indeed!” cried Elizabeth. “Implacable resentment","Pride and Prejudice"

"really cannot _laugh_ at it. You are safe from me.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some particular","Pride and Prejudice"

"In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth wrote the","Pride and Prejudice"

"them in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet, who had calculated on","Pride and Prejudice"
"her daughters remaining at Netherfield till the following Tuesday, which","Pride and Prejudice"
"would exactly finish Jane’s week, could not bring herself to receive","Pride and Prejudice"
"them with pleasure before. Her answer, therefore, was not propitious, at","Pride and Prejudice"
"least not to Elizabeth’s wishes, for she was impatient to get home. Mrs.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage","Pride and Prejudice"
"before Tuesday; and in her postscript it was added, that if Mr. Bingley","Pride and Prejudice"
"and his sister pressed them to stay longer, she could spare them very","Pride and Prejudice"
"well. Against staying longer, however, Elizabeth was positively","Pride and Prejudice"
"resolved--nor did she much expect it would be asked; and fearful, on the","Pride and Prejudice"
"contrary, of being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long,","Pride and Prejudice"
"she urged Jane to borrow Mr. Bingley’s carriage immediately, and at","Pride and Prejudice"
"length it was settled that their original design of leaving Netherfield","Pride and Prejudice"
"that morning should be mentioned, and the request made.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough was","Pride and Prejudice"
"said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on","Pride and Prejudice"
"Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred. Miss Bingley was","Pride and Prejudice"
"then sorry that she had proposed the delay; for her jealousy and dislike","Pride and Prejudice"
"of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so","Pride and Prejudice"
"soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it would not be","Pride and Prejudice"
"safe for her--that she was not enough recovered; but Jane was firm where","Pride and Prejudice"
"she felt herself to be right.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence: Elizabeth had been at","Pride and Prejudice"
"Netherfield long enough. She attracted him more than he liked; and Miss","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bingley was uncivil to _her_ and more teasing than usual to himself. He","Pride and Prejudice"
"wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration","Pride and Prejudice"
"should _now_ escape him--nothing that could elevate her with the hope of","Pride and Prejudice"
"influencing his felicity; sensible that, if such an idea had been","Pride and Prejudice"
"suggested, his behaviour during the last day must have material weight","Pride and Prejudice"
"in confirming or crushing it. Steady to his purpose, he scarcely spoke","Pride and Prejudice"
"ten words to her through the whole of Saturday: and though they were at","Pride and Prejudice"
"one time left by themselves for half an hour, he adhered most","Pride and Prejudice"
"conscientiously to his book, and would not even look at her.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to almost","Pride and Prejudice"
"all, took place. Miss Bingley’s civility to Elizabeth increased at last","Pride and Prejudice"
"very rapidly, as well as her affection for Jane; and when they parted,","Pride and Prejudice"
"after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to","Pride and Prejudice"
"see her either at Longbourn or Netherfield, and embracing her most","Pride and Prejudice"
"tenderly, she even shook hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave of","Pride and Prejudice"
"the whole party in the liveliest spirits.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs. Bennet","Pride and Prejudice"
"wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to give so much","Pride and Prejudice"
"trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold again. But their","Pride and Prejudice"
"father, though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure, was really","Pride and Prejudice"
"glad to see them; he had felt their importance in the family circle. The","Pride and Prejudice"
"evening conversation, when they were all assembled, had lost much of its","Pride and Prejudice"

"Elizabeth.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough bass and human","Pride and Prejudice"
"nature; and had some new extracts to admire and some new observations of","Pride and Prejudice"
"threadbare morality to listen to. Catherine and Lydia had information","Pride and Prejudice"
"for them of a different sort. Much had been done, and much had been said","Pride and Prejudice"
"in the regiment since the preceding Wednesday; several of the officers","Pride and Prejudice"

"“I hope, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet to his wife, as they were at","Pride and Prejudice"
"breakfast the next morning, “that you have ordered a good dinner to-day,","Pride and Prejudice"
"because I have reason to expect an addition to our family party.”","Pride and Prejudice"

"“It is _not_ Mr. Bingley,” said her husband; “it is a person whom I","Pride and Prejudice"
"never saw in the whole course of my life.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"This roused a general astonishment; and he had the pleasure of being","Pride and Prejudice"
"eagerly questioned by his wife and five daughters at once.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he thus","Pride and Prejudice"
"explained:--“About a month ago I received this letter, and about a","Pride and Prejudice"
"fortnight ago I answered it; for I thought it a case of some delicacy,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and requiring early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins, who,","Pride and Prejudice"
"when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon as he","Pride and Prejudice"
"pleases.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Oh, my dear,” cried his wife, “I cannot bear to hear that mentioned.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is the hardest thing","Pride and Prejudice"
"in the world, that your estate should be entailed away from your own","Pride and Prejudice"
"children; and I am sure, if I had been you, I should have tried long ago","Pride and Prejudice"
"to do something or other about it.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Jane and Elizabeth attempted to explain to her the nature of an entail.","Pride and Prejudice"
"They had often attempted it before: but it was a subject on which Mrs.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bennet was beyond the reach of reason; and she continued to rail","Pride and Prejudice"
"bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of","Pride and Prejudice"
"five daughters, in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,” said Mr. Bennet; “and","Pride and Prejudice"
"nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting Longbourn.","Pride and Prejudice"
"But if you will listen to his letter, you may, perhaps, be a little","Pride and Prejudice"
"softened by his manner of expressing himself.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“No, that I am sure I shall not: and I think it was very impertinent of","Pride and Prejudice"

"     hospitality till the Saturday se’nnight following, which I can do","Pride and Prejudice"
"     without any inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from objecting","Pride and Prejudice"
"     to my occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that some other","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“At four o’clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making gentleman,”","Pride and Prejudice"
"said Mr. Bennet, as he folded up the letter. “He seems to be a most","Pride and Prejudice"

"prove a valuable acquaintance, especially if Lady Catherine should be so","Pride and Prejudice"
"indulgent as to let him come to us again.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“There is some sense in what he says about the girls, however; and, if","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Though it is difficult,” said Jane, “to guess in what way he can mean","Pride and Prejudice"
"to make us the atonement he thinks our due, the wish is certainly to his","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth was chiefly struck with his extraordinary deference for Lady","Pride and Prejudice"

"his parishioners whenever it were required.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“He must be an oddity, I think,” said she. “I cannot make him out. There","Pride and Prejudice"
"is something very pompous in his style. And what can he mean by","Pride and Prejudice"
"apologizing for being next in the entail? We cannot suppose he would","Pride and Prejudice"
"help it, if he could. Can he be a sensible man, sir?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“No, my dear; I think not. I have great hopes of finding him quite the","Pride and Prejudice"

"letter which promises well. I am impatient to see him.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“In point of composition,” said Mary, “his letter does not seem","Pride and Prejudice"

"think it is well expressed.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"To Catherine and Lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any","Pride and Prejudice"
"degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their cousin should","Pride and Prejudice"
"come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks since they had","Pride and Prejudice"
"received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour. As for","Pride and Prejudice"
"their mother, Mr. Collins’s letter had done away much of her ill-will,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which","Pride and Prejudice"
"astonished her husband and daughters.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Collins was punctual to his time, and was received with great","Pride and Prejudice"
"politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little; but the","Pride and Prejudice"
"ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed neither in need","Pride and Prejudice"
"of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent himself. He was a tall,","Pride and Prejudice"
"heavy-looking young man of five-and-twenty. His air was grave and","Pride and Prejudice"
"stately, and his manners were very formal. He had not been long seated","Pride and Prejudice"
"before he complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of","Pride and Prejudice"
"daughters, said he had heard much of their beauty, but that, in this","Pride and Prejudice"
"instance, fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he did not","Pride and Prejudice"
"doubt her seeing them all in due time well disposed of in marriage. This","Pride and Prejudice"
"gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers; but Mrs.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bennet, who quarrelled with no compliments, answered most readily,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You are very kind, sir, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it may","Pride and Prejudice"
"prove so; for else they will be destitute enough. Things are settled so","Pride and Prejudice"
"oddly.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Ah, sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls, you","Pride and Prejudice"
"must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for such things,","Pride and Prejudice"
"I know, are all chance in this world. There is no knowing how estates","Pride and Prejudice"
"will go when once they come to be entailed.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of appearing","Pride and Prejudice"
"forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young ladies that I come","Pride and Prejudice"
"prepared to admire them. At present I will not say more, but, perhaps,","Pride and Prejudice"
"when we are better acquainted----”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"He was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled on each","Pride and Prejudice"
"other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins’s admiration. The","Pride and Prejudice"
"hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture, were examined and praised;","Pride and Prejudice"
"and his commendation of everything would have touched Mrs. Bennet’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"heart, but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his","Pride and Prejudice"
"own future property. The dinner, too, in its turn, was highly admired;","Pride and Prejudice"
"and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellence of its","Pride and Prejudice"
"cookery was owing. But here he was set right by Mrs. Bennet, who assured","Pride and Prejudice"
"him, with some asperity, that they were very well able to keep a good","Pride and Prejudice"
"cook, and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He begged","Pride and Prejudice"
"pardon for having displeased her. In a softened tone she declared","Pride and Prejudice"

"Catherine de Bourgh’s attention to his wishes, and consideration for his","Pride and Prejudice"
"comfort, appeared very remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen","Pride and Prejudice"
"better. Mr. Collins was eloquent in her praise. The subject elevated him","Pride and Prejudice"
"to more than usual solemnity of manner; and with a most important aspect","Pride and Prejudice"
"he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a","Pride and Prejudice"
"person of rank--such affability and condescension, as he had himself","Pride and Prejudice"
"experienced from Lady Catherine. She had been graciously pleased to","Pride and Prejudice"
"approve of both the discourses which he had already had the honour of","Pride and Prejudice"
"preaching before her. She had also asked him twice to dine at Rosings,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and had sent for him only the Saturday before, to make up her pool of","Pride and Prejudice"
"quadrille in the evening. Lady Catherine was reckoned proud by many","Pride and Prejudice"
"people, he knew, but _he_ had never seen anything but affability in her.","Pride and Prejudice"
"She had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman; she","Pride and Prejudice"
"made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the","Pride and Prejudice"
"neighbourhood, nor to his leaving his parish occasionally for a week or","Pride and Prejudice"
"two to visit his relations. She had even condescended to advise him to","Pride and Prejudice"
"marry as soon as he could, provided he chose with discretion; and had","Pride and Prejudice"
"once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage, where she had perfectly","Pride and Prejudice"
"approved all the alterations he had been making, and had even vouchsafed","Pride and Prejudice"
"to suggest some herself,--some shelves in the closets upstairs.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,” said Mrs. Bennet, “and I","Pride and Prejudice"

"“She is a most charming young lady, indeed. Lady Catherine herself says","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature had","Pride and Prejudice"
"been but little assisted by education or society; the greatest part of","Pride and Prejudice"
"his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and","Pride and Prejudice"
"miserly father; and though he belonged to one of the universities, he","Pride and Prejudice"
"had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful","Pride and Prejudice"
"acquaintance. The subjection in which his father had brought him up had","Pride and Prejudice"
"given him originally great humility of manner; but it was now a good","Pride and Prejudice"
"deal counteracted by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in","Pride and Prejudice"
"retirement, and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected","Pride and Prejudice"
"prosperity. A fortunate chance had recommended him to Lady Catherine de","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bourgh when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he","Pride and Prejudice"
"felt for her high rank, and his veneration for her as his patroness,","Pride and Prejudice"
"mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his authority as a","Pride and Prejudice"
"clergyman, and his right as a rector, made him altogether a mixture of","Pride and Prejudice"
"pride and obsequiousness, self-importance and humility.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he intended to","Pride and Prejudice"
"marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn family he had","Pride and Prejudice"
"a wife in view, as he meant to choose one of the daughters, if he found","Pride and Prejudice"
"them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report.","Pride and Prejudice"
"This was his plan of amends--of atonement--for inheriting their father’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"estate; and he thought it an excellent one, full of eligibility and","Pride and Prejudice"
"suitableness, and excessively generous and disinterested on his own","Pride and Prejudice"
"part.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"His plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet’s lovely face","Pride and Prejudice"
"confirmed his views, and established all his strictest notions of what","Pride and Prejudice"
"was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she_ was his settled","Pride and Prejudice"
"choice. The next morning, however, made an alteration; for in a quarter","Pride and Prejudice"
"of an hour’s _tête-à-tête_ with Mrs. Bennet before breakfast, a","Pride and Prejudice"
"conversation beginning with his parsonage-house, and leading naturally","Pride and Prejudice"
"to the avowal of his hopes, that a mistress for it might be found at","Pride and Prejudice"
"Longbourn, produced from her, amid very complaisant smiles and general","Pride and Prejudice"
"encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he had fixed on. “As to","Pride and Prejudice"
"her _younger_ daughters, she could not take upon her to say--she could","Pride and Prejudice"
"not positively answer--but she did not _know_ of any prepossession;--her","Pride and Prejudice"
"_eldest_ daughter she must just mention--she felt it incumbent on her to","Pride and Prejudice"
"hint, was likely to be very soon engaged.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth--and it was soon","Pride and Prejudice"
"done--done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire. Elizabeth, equally","Pride and Prejudice"
"next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded her of course.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she might soon have","Pride and Prejudice"
"two daughters married; and the man whom she could not bear to speak of","Pride and Prejudice"
"the day before, was now high in her good graces.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Lydia’s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten: every sister","Pride and Prejudice"
"except Mary agreed to go with her; and Mr. Collins was to attend them,","Pride and Prejudice"
"at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious to get rid of him,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and have his library to himself; for thither Mr. Collins had followed","Pride and Prejudice"
"him after breakfast, and there he would continue, nominally engaged with","Pride and Prejudice"
"one of the largest folios in the collection, but really talking to Mr.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bennet, with little cessation, of his house and garden at Hunsford. Such","Pride and Prejudice"
"doings discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his library he had been","Pride and Prejudice"
"always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as he told","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other room in the","Pride and Prejudice"
"house, he was used to be free from them there: his civility, therefore,","Pride and Prejudice"
"was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to join his daughters in their","Pride and Prejudice"
"walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact much better fitted for a walker","Pride and Prejudice"
"than a reader, was extremely well pleased to close his large book, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"go.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"In pompous nothings on his side, and civil assents on that of his","Pride and Prejudice"
"cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The attention of","Pride and Prejudice"
"the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by _him_. Their eyes","Pride and Prejudice"
"were immediately wandering up the street in quest of the officers, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"nothing less than a very smart bonnet, indeed, or a really new muslin in","Pride and Prejudice"
"a shop window, could recall them.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man, whom","Pride and Prejudice"
"they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike appearance, walking","Pride and Prejudice"
"with an officer on the other side of the way. The officer was the very","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Denny concerning whose return from London Lydia came to inquire, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"he bowed as they passed. All were struck with the stranger’s air, all","Pride and Prejudice"
"wondered who he could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible","Pride and Prejudice"
"to find out, led the way across the street, under pretence of wanting","Pride and Prejudice"
"something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained the","Pride and Prejudice"
"pavement, when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached the same","Pride and Prejudice"
"spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated permission to","Pride and Prejudice"
"introduce his friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned with him the day","Pride and Prejudice"
"before from town, and, he was happy to say, had accepted a commission in","Pride and Prejudice"
"their corps. This was exactly as it should be; for the young man wanted","Pride and Prejudice"
"only regimentals to make him completely charming. His appearance was","Pride and Prejudice"
"greatly in his favour: he had all the best parts of beauty, a fine","Pride and Prejudice"
"countenance, a good figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction","Pride and Prejudice"
"was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversation--a","Pride and Prejudice"
"readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the","Pride and Prejudice"
"whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,","Pride and Prejudice"
"when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley were","Pride and Prejudice"
"seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the ladies of the group","Pride and Prejudice"
"the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and began the usual","Pride and Prejudice"
"civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman, and Miss Bennet the","Pride and Prejudice"
"principal object. He was then, he said, on his way to Longbourn on","Pride and Prejudice"
"purpose to inquire after her. Mr. Darcy corroborated it with a bow, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on Elizabeth, when they","Pride and Prejudice"
"were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger; and Elizabeth","Pride and Prejudice"
"happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other,","Pride and Prejudice"
"was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour,","Pride and Prejudice"
"one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few moments,","Pride and Prejudice"
"touched his hat--a salutation which Mr. Darcy just deigned to return.","Pride and Prejudice"
"What could be the meaning of it? It was impossible to imagine; it was","Pride and Prejudice"
"impossible not to long to know.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"In another minute Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have noticed what","Pride and Prejudice"
"passed, took leave and rode on with his friend.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Philips’s house, and then made their bows, in spite of Miss Lydia’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"pressing entreaties that they would come in, and even in spite of Mrs.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Philips’s throwing up the parlour window, and loudly seconding the","Pride and Prejudice"
"invitation.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mrs. Philips was always glad to see her nieces; and the two eldest, from","Pride and Prejudice"
"their recent absence, were particularly welcome; and she was eagerly","Pride and Prejudice"
"expressing her surprise at their sudden return home, which, as their own","Pride and Prejudice"
"carriage had not fetched them, she should have known nothing about, if","Pride and Prejudice"
"she had not happened to see Mr. Jones’s shopboy in the street, who had","Pride and Prejudice"
"told her that they were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield,","Pride and Prejudice"
"because the Miss Bennets were come away, when her civility was claimed","Pride and Prejudice"
"towards Mr. Collins by Jane’s introduction of him. She received him with","Pride and Prejudice"
"her very best politeness, which he returned with as much more,","Pride and Prejudice"
"apologizing for his intrusion, without any previous acquaintance with","Pride and Prejudice"
"her, which he could not help flattering himself, however, might be","Pride and Prejudice"
"justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to","Pride and Prejudice"
"her notice. Mrs. Philips was quite awed by such an excess of good","Pride and Prejudice"
"breeding; but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put an end to","Pride and Prejudice"
"by exclamations and inquiries about the other, of whom, however, she","Pride and Prejudice"
"could only tell her nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny had","Pride and Prejudice"
"brought him from London, and that he was to have a lieutenant’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"commission in the ----shire. She had been watching him the last hour,","Pride and Prejudice"
"she said, as he walked up and down the street,--and had Mr. Wickham","Pride and Prejudice"
"appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have continued the occupation;","Pride and Prejudice"
"but unluckily no one passed the windows now except a few of the","Pride and Prejudice"
"officers, who, in comparison with the stranger, were become “stupid,","Pride and Prejudice"
"disagreeable fellows.” Some of them were to dine with the Philipses the","Pride and Prejudice"
"next day, and their aunt promised to make her husband call on Mr.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Wickham, and give him an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn","Pride and Prejudice"
"would come in the evening. This was agreed to; and Mrs. Philips","Pride and Prejudice"
"protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery","Pride and Prejudice"
"tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect of such","Pride and Prejudice"
"delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual good spirits. Mr.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room, and was assured,","Pride and Prejudice"
"with unwearying civility, that they were perfectly needless.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she had seen pass","Pride and Prejudice"
"between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have defended either or","Pride and Prejudice"
"both, had they appeared to be wrong, she could no more explain such","Pride and Prejudice"
"behaviour than her sister.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Collins on his return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by admiring Mrs.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Philips’s manners and politeness. He protested that, except Lady","Pride and Prejudice"
"Catherine and her daughter, he had never seen a more elegant woman; for","Pride and Prejudice"
"she had not only received him with the utmost civility, but had even","Pride and Prejudice"
"pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening, although","Pride and Prejudice"
"utterly unknown to her before. Something, he supposed, might be","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he","Pride and Prejudice"
"received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first there","Pride and Prejudice"
"seemed danger of Lydia’s engrossing him entirely, for she was a most","Pride and Prejudice"

"she soon grew too much interested in the game, too eager in making bets","Pride and Prejudice"

"Allowing for the common demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore","Pride and Prejudice"
"at leisure to talk to Elizabeth, and she was very willing to hear him,","Pride and Prejudice"
"though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be told,","Pride and Prejudice"
"the history of his acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She dared not even","Pride and Prejudice"
"mention that gentleman. Her curiosity, however, was unexpectedly","Pride and Prejudice"
"relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He inquired how far","Pride and Prejudice"
"Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her answer, asked in","Pride and Prejudice"
"a hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been staying there.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“About a month,” said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the subject","Pride and Prejudice"
"drop, added, “he is a man of very large property in Derbyshire, I","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yes,” replied Wickham; “his estate there is a noble one. A clear ten","Pride and Prejudice"

"yesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“As much as I ever wish to be,” cried Elizabeth, warmly. “I have spent","Pride and Prejudice"
"four days in the same house with him, and I think him very","Pride and Prejudice"
"disagreeable.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I have no right to give _my_ opinion,” said Wickham, “as to his being","Pride and Prejudice"
"agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I have known him","Pride and Prejudice"
"too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is impossible for _me_ to","Pride and Prejudice"
"be impartial. But I believe your opinion of him would in general","Pride and Prejudice"
"astonish--and, perhaps, you would not express it quite so strongly","Pride and Prejudice"
"anywhere else. Here you are in your own family.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Upon my word I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house in the","Pride and Prejudice"

"“I cannot pretend to be sorry,” said Wickham, after a short","Pride and Prejudice"
"interruption, “that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Indeed!”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yes--the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best","Pride and Prejudice"
"living in his gift. He was my godfather, and excessively attached to me.","Pride and Prejudice"
"I cannot do justice to his kindness. He meant to provide for me amply,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and thought he had done it; but when the living fell, it was given","Pride and Prejudice"
"elsewhere.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Good heavens!” cried Elizabeth; “but how could _that_ be? How could his","Pride and Prejudice"
"will be disregarded? Why did not you seek legal redress?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to","Pride and Prejudice"
"give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have doubted the","Pride and Prejudice"
"intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it--or to treat it as a merely","Pride and Prejudice"
"conditional recommendation, and to assert that I had forfeited all claim","Pride and Prejudice"
"to it by extravagance, imprudence, in short, anything or nothing.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I","Pride and Prejudice"
"was of an age to hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no","Pride and Prejudice"
"less certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done","Pride and Prejudice"
"anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm unguarded temper, and I","Pride and Prejudice"
"may perhaps have sometimes spoken my opinion _of_ him, and _to_ him, too","Pride and Prejudice"
"freely. I can recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are very","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"

"can forget his father, I can never defy or expose _him_.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth honoured him for such feelings, and thought him handsomer than","Pride and Prejudice"
"ever as he expressed them.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“But what,” said she, after a pause, “can have been his motive? what can","Pride and Prejudice"
"have induced him to behave so cruelly?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“A thorough, determined dislike of me--a dislike which I cannot but","Pride and Prejudice"
"attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy liked me","Pride and Prejudice"
"less, his son might have borne with me better; but his father’s uncommon","Pride and Prejudice"
"attachment to me irritated him, I believe, very early in life. He had","Pride and Prejudice"
"not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stood--the sort","Pride and Prejudice"
"of preference which was often given me.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this--though I have never liked","Pride and Prejudice"
"him, I had not thought so very ill of him--I had supposed him to be","Pride and Prejudice"
"despising his fellow-creatures in general, but did not suspect him of","Pride and Prejudice"
"descending to such malicious revenge, such injustice, such inhumanity as","Pride and Prejudice"
"this!”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"After a few minutes’ reflection, however, she continued, “I _do_","Pride and Prejudice"
"remember his boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the implacability of","Pride and Prejudice"
"his resentments, of his having an unforgiving temper. His disposition","Pride and Prejudice"
"must be dreadful.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I will not trust myself on the subject,” replied Wickham; “_I_ can","Pride and Prejudice"
"hardly be just to him.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed, “To","Pride and Prejudice"
"treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite of his","Pride and Prejudice"
"father!” She could have added, “A young man, too, like _you_, whose very","Pride and Prejudice"
"countenance may vouch for your being amiable.” But she contented herself","Pride and Prejudice"
"with--“And one, too, who had probably been his own companion from","Pride and Prejudice"
"childhood, connected together, as I think you said, in the closest","Pride and Prejudice"
"manner.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the greatest","Pride and Prejudice"
"part of our youth was passed together: inmates of the same house,","Pride and Prejudice"
"sharing the same amusements, objects of the same parental care. _My_","Pride and Prejudice"
"father began life in the profession which your uncle, Mr. Philips,","Pride and Prejudice"
"appears to do so much credit to; but he gave up everything to be of use","Pride and Prejudice"
"to the late Mr. Darcy, and devoted all his time to the care of the","Pride and Prejudice"
"Pemberley property. He was most highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most","Pride and Prejudice"
"intimate, confidential friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to","Pride and Prejudice"
"be under the greatest obligations to my father’s active superintendence;","Pride and Prejudice"
"and when, immediately before my father’s death, Mr. Darcy gave him a","Pride and Prejudice"
"voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he felt it","Pride and Prejudice"
"to be as much a debt of gratitude to _him_ as of affection to myself.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“How strange!” cried Elizabeth. “How abominable! I wonder that the very","Pride and Prejudice"
"pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him just to you. If from no better","Pride and Prejudice"
"motive, that he should not have been too proud to be dishonest,--for","Pride and Prejudice"
"dishonesty I must call it.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“It _is_ wonderful,” replied Wickham; “for almost all his actions may be","Pride and Prejudice"
"traced to pride; and pride has often been his best friend. It has","Pride and Prejudice"
"connected him nearer with virtue than any other feeling. But we are none","Pride and Prejudice"
"of us consistent; and in his behaviour to me there were stronger","Pride and Prejudice"
"impulses even than pride.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Can such abominable pride as his have ever done him good?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yes; it has often led him to be liberal and generous; to give his money","Pride and Prejudice"
"freely, to display hospitality, to assist his tenants, and relieve the","Pride and Prejudice"
"poor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride, for he is very proud of what his","Pride and Prejudice"
"father was, have done this. Not to appear to disgrace his family, to","Pride and Prejudice"
"degenerate from the popular qualities, or lose the influence of the","Pride and Prejudice"
"Pemberley House, is a powerful motive. He has also _brotherly_ pride,","Pride and Prejudice"
"which, with _some_ brotherly affection, makes him a very kind and","Pride and Prejudice"
"careful guardian of his sister; and you will hear him generally cried up","Pride and Prejudice"
"as the most attentive and best of brothers.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“What sort of a girl is Miss Darcy?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"He shook his head. “I wish I could call her amiable. It gives me pain to","Pride and Prejudice"
"speak ill of a Darcy; but she is too much like her brother,--very, very","Pride and Prejudice"
"proud. As a child, she was affectionate and pleasing, and extremely fond","Pride and Prejudice"
"of me; and I have devoted hours and hours to her amusement. But she is","Pride and Prejudice"
"nothing to me now. She is a handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and, I understand, highly accomplished. Since her father’s death her","Pride and Prejudice"
"home has been London, where a lady lives with her, and superintends her","Pride and Prejudice"
"education.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth could not","Pride and Prejudice"
"help reverting once more to the first, and saying,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I am astonished at his intimacy with Mr. Bingley. How can Mr. Bingley,","Pride and Prejudice"
"who seems good-humour itself, and is, I really believe, truly amiable,","Pride and Prejudice"
"be in friendship with such a man? How can they suit each other? Do you","Pride and Prejudice"
"know Mr. Bingley?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Not at all.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“He is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He cannot know what Mr.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Darcy is.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he chooses. He does not","Pride and Prejudice"
"want abilities. He can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth","Pride and Prejudice"
"his while. Among those who are at all his equals in consequence, he is a","Pride and Prejudice"
"very different man from what he is to the less prosperous. His pride","Pride and Prejudice"
"never deserts him; but with the rich he is liberal-minded, just,","Pride and Prejudice"
"sincere, rational, honourable, and, perhaps, agreeable,--allowing","Pride and Prejudice"
"something for fortune and figure.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered round","Pride and Prejudice"
"the other table, and Mr. Collins took his station between his cousin","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth and Mrs. Philips. The usual inquiries as to his success were","Pride and Prejudice"
"made by the latter. It had not been very great; he had lost every point;","Pride and Prejudice"
"but when Mrs. Philips began to express her concern thereupon, he assured","Pride and Prejudice"
"her, with much earnest gravity, that it was not of the least importance;","Pride and Prejudice"
"that he considered the money as a mere trifle, and begged she would not","Pride and Prejudice"
"make herself uneasy.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I know very well, madam,” said he, “that when persons sit down to a","Pride and Prejudice"
"card table they must take their chance of these things,--and happily I","Pride and Prejudice"
"am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object. There","Pride and Prejudice"
"are, undoubtedly, many who could not say the same; but, thanks to Lady","Pride and Prejudice"
"Catherine de Bourgh, I am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding","Pride and Prejudice"
"little matters.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Wickham’s attention was caught; and after observing Mr. Collins for","Pride and Prejudice"
"a few moments, he asked Elizabeth in a low voice whether her relations","Pride and Prejudice"
"were very intimately acquainted with the family of De Bourgh.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Lady Catherine de Bourgh,” she replied, “has very lately given him a","Pride and Prejudice"
"living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced to her","Pride and Prejudice"
"notice, but he certainly has not known her long.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne Darcy","Pride and Prejudice"
"were sisters; consequently that she is aunt to the present Mr. Darcy.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"connections. I never heard of her existence till the day before","Pride and Prejudice"
"yesterday.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Her daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune, and it is","Pride and Prejudice"
"believed that she and her cousin will unite the two estates.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"This information made Elizabeth smile, as she thought of poor Miss","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her attentions, vain and useless her","Pride and Prejudice"
"affection for his sister and her praise of himself, if he were already","Pride and Prejudice"
"self-destined to another.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Mr. Collins,” said she, “speaks highly both of Lady Catherine and her","Pride and Prejudice"
"daughter; but, from some particulars that he has related of her","Pride and Prejudice"
"Ladyship, I suspect his gratitude misleads him; and that, in spite of","Pride and Prejudice"
"her being his patroness, she is an arrogant, conceited woman.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I believe her to be both in a great degree,” replied Wickham; “I have","Pride and Prejudice"
"not seen her for many years; but I very well remember that I never liked","Pride and Prejudice"
"her, and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent. She has the","Pride and Prejudice"
"reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever; but I rather believe","Pride and Prejudice"
"she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune, part from","Pride and Prejudice"
"her authoritative manner, and the rest from the pride of her nephew, who","Pride and Prejudice"
"chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of","Pride and Prejudice"
"the first class.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put","Pride and Prejudice"
"an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies their share of Mr.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Wickham’s attentions. There could be no conversation in the noise of","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mrs. Philips’s supper party, but his manners recommended him to","Pride and Prejudice"
"everybody. Whatever he said, was said well; and whatever he did, done","Pride and Prejudice"
"gracefully. Elizabeth went away with her head full of him. She could","Pride and Prejudice"
"think of nothing but of Mr. Wickham, and of what he had told her, all","Pride and Prejudice"
"the way home; but there was not time for her even to mention his name as","Pride and Prejudice"
"they went, for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia","Pride and Prejudice"

"knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so unworthy of Mr.","Pride and Prejudice"

"otherwise explained.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"

"somebody.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my","Pride and Prejudice"
"opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful light","Pride and Prejudice"
"it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his father’s favourite in such a","Pride and Prejudice"
"manner,--one whom his father had promised to provide for. It is","Pride and Prejudice"
"impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had any value for his","Pride and Prejudice"
"character, could be capable of it. Can his most intimate friends be so","Pride and Prejudice"
"excessively deceived in him? Oh no.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley’s being imposed on than that","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last","Pride and Prejudice"
"night; names, facts, everything mentioned without ceremony. If it be not","Pride and Prejudice"
"so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides, there was truth in his looks.”","Pride and Prejudice"

"think.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I beg your pardon;--one knows exactly what to think.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"But Jane could think with certainty on only one point,--that Mr.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bingley, if he _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer when","Pride and Prejudice"
"the affair became public.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this","Pride and Prejudice"
"conversation passed, by the arrival of some of the very persons of whom","Pride and Prejudice"
"they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his sisters came to give their","Pride and Prejudice"
"personal invitation for the long expected ball at Netherfield, which was","Pride and Prejudice"
"fixed for the following Tuesday. The two ladies were delighted to see","Pride and Prejudice"
"their dear friend again, called it an age since they had met, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their","Pride and Prejudice"
"separation. To the rest of the family they paid little attention;","Pride and Prejudice"
"avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and nothing at all to the others. They were soon gone again, rising from","Pride and Prejudice"
"their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet’s civilities.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every","Pride and Prejudice"
"female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as given in","Pride and Prejudice"
"compliment to her eldest daughter, and was particularly flattered by","Pride and Prejudice"
"receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself, instead of a","Pride and Prejudice"
"ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the","Pride and Prejudice"
"society of her two friends, and the attentions of their brother; and","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with Mr.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of everything in Mr. Darcy’s look","Pride and Prejudice"
"and behaviour. The happiness anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended","Pride and Prejudice"
"less on any single event, or any particular person; for though they","Pride and Prejudice"
"each, like Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham,","Pride and Prejudice"
"he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a ball","Pride and Prejudice"
"was, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her family that she","Pride and Prejudice"
"had no disinclination for it.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“While I can have my mornings to myself,” said she, “it is enough. I","Pride and Prejudice"
"think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself one of those who","Pride and Prejudice"
"consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for","Pride and Prejudice"
"everybody.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth’s spirits were so high on the occasion, that though she did","Pride and Prejudice"
"not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she could not help asking","Pride and Prejudice"
"him whether he intended to accept Mr. Bingley’s invitation, and if he","Pride and Prejudice"
"did, whether he would think it proper to join in the evening’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"amusement; and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no","Pride and Prejudice"
"scruple whatever on that head, and was very far from dreading a rebuke,","Pride and Prejudice"
"either from the Archbishop or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to","Pride and Prejudice"
"dance.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I am by no means of opinion, I assure you,” said he, “that a ball of","Pride and Prejudice"
"this kind, given by a young man of character, to respectable people, can","Pride and Prejudice"
"have any evil tendency; and I am so far from objecting to dancing","Pride and Prejudice"
"myself, that I shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair","Pride and Prejudice"
"cousins in the course of the evening; and I take this opportunity of","Pride and Prejudice"
"soliciting yours, Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially; a","Pride and Prejudice"
"preference which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right","Pride and Prejudice"
"cause, and not to any disrespect for her.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She had fully proposed being","Pride and Prejudice"
"engaged by Wickham for those very dances; and to have Mr. Collins","Pride and Prejudice"
"instead!--her liveliness had been never worse timed. There was no help","Pride and Prejudice"
"for it, however. Mr. Wickham’s happiness and her own was perforce","Pride and Prejudice"
"delayed a little longer, and Mr. Collins’s proposal accepted with as","Pride and Prejudice"
"good a grace as she could. She was not the better pleased with his","Pride and Prejudice"
"gallantry, from the idea it suggested of something more. It now first","Pride and Prejudice"
"struck her, that _she_ was selected from among her sisters as worthy of","Pride and Prejudice"
"being the mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a","Pride and Prejudice"
"quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible visitors.","Pride and Prejudice"
"The idea soon reached to conviction, as she observed his increasing","Pride and Prejudice"
"civilities towards herself, and heard his frequent attempt at a","Pride and Prejudice"
"compliment on her wit and vivacity; and though more astonished than","Pride and Prejudice"
"gratified herself by this effect of her charms, it was not long before","Pride and Prejudice"
"her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage","Pride and Prejudice"
"was exceedingly agreeable to _her_. Elizabeth, however, did not choose","Pride and Prejudice"
"to take the hint, being well aware that a serious dispute must be the","Pride and Prejudice"
"consequence of any reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and,","Pride and Prejudice"
"till he did, it was useless to quarrel about him.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of, the","Pride and Prejudice"

"for, from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball, there was","Pride and Prejudice"
"such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to Meryton once. No","Pride and Prejudice"

"Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and looked in","Pride and Prejudice"
"vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled, a","Pride and Prejudice"
"doubt of his being present had never occurred to her. The certainty of","Pride and Prejudice"
"meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that","Pride and Prejudice"
"might not unreasonably have alarmed her. She had dressed with more than","Pride and Prejudice"
"usual care, and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all","Pride and Prejudice"
"that remained unsubdued of his heart, trusting that it was not more than","Pride and Prejudice"
"might be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the","Pride and Prejudice"
"dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted, for Mr. Darcy’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"pleasure, in the Bingleys’ invitation to the officers; and though this","Pride and Prejudice"
"was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his absence was","Pride and Prejudice"
"pronounced by his friend Mr. Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly applied, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to town on business","Pride and Prejudice"
"the day before, and was not yet returned; adding, with a significant","Pride and Prejudice"
"smile,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I do not imagine his business would have called him away just now, if","Pride and Prejudice"
"he had not wished to avoid a certain gentleman here.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"This part of his intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was caught by","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth; and, as it assured her that Darcy was not less answerable for","Pride and Prejudice"
"Wickham’s absence than if her first surmise had been just, every feeling","Pride and Prejudice"
"of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate","Pride and Prejudice"
"disappointment, that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to","Pride and Prejudice"
"the polite inquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Attention, forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She","Pride and Prejudice"
"was resolved against any sort of conversation with him, and turned away","Pride and Prejudice"
"with a degree of ill-humour which she could not wholly surmount even in","Pride and Prejudice"
"speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality provoked her.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every prospect","Pride and Prejudice"
"of her own was destroyed for the evening, it could not dwell long on her","Pride and Prejudice"
"spirits; and, having told all her griefs to Charlotte Lucas, whom she","Pride and Prejudice"
"had not seen for a week, she was soon able to make a voluntary","Pride and Prejudice"
"transition to the oddities of her cousin, and to point him out to her","Pride and Prejudice"
"particular notice. The two first dances, however, brought a return of","Pride and Prejudice"
"distress: they were dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and","Pride and Prejudice"
"solemn, apologizing instead of attending, and often moving wrong","Pride and Prejudice"
"without being aware of it, gave her all the shame and misery which a","Pride and Prejudice"
"disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment of her","Pride and Prejudice"
"release from him was ecstasy.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of talking of","Pride and Prejudice"
"Wickham, and of hearing that he was universally liked. When those dances","Pride and Prejudice"
"were over, she returned to Charlotte Lucas, and was in conversation with","Pride and Prejudice"
"her, when she found herself suddenly addressed by Mr. Darcy, who took","Pride and Prejudice"
"her so much by surprise in his application for her hand, that, without","Pride and Prejudice"
"knowing what she did, she accepted him. He walked away again","Pride and Prejudice"
"immediately, and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of","Pride and Prejudice"

"“I dare say you will find him very agreeable.”","Pride and Prejudice"

"When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to claim her","Pride and Prejudice"

"in the eyes of a man often times his consequence. Elizabeth made no","Pride and Prejudice"
"answer, and took her place in the set, amazed at the dignity to which","Pride and Prejudice"
"she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"reading in her neighbours’ looks their equal amazement in beholding it.","Pride and Prejudice"
"They stood for some time without speaking a word; and she began to","Pride and Prejudice"
"imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances, and, at","Pride and Prejudice"
"first, was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying that it","Pride and Prejudice"
"would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk,","Pride and Prejudice"
"she made some slight observation on the dance. He replied, and was again","Pride and Prejudice"
"silent. After a pause of some minutes, she addressed him a second time,","Pride and Prejudice"
"with--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“It is _your_ turn to say something now, Mr. Darcy. _I_ talked about the","Pride and Prejudice"
"dance, and _you_ ought to make some kind of remark on the size of the","Pride and Prejudice"
"room, or the number of couples.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"He smiled, and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be","Pride and Prejudice"
"said.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Very well; that reply will do for the present. Perhaps, by-and-by, I","Pride and Prejudice"
"may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones; but","Pride and Prejudice"
"_now_ we may be silent.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd to be","Pride and Prejudice"
"entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet, for the advantage of","Pride and Prejudice"
"_some_, conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the","Pride and Prejudice"
"trouble of saying as little as possible.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do you","Pride and Prejudice"
"imagine that you are gratifying mine?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Both,” replied Elizabeth archly; “for I have always seen a great","Pride and Prejudice"
"similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,","Pride and Prejudice"
"taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say","Pride and Prejudice"
"something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to","Pride and Prejudice"
"posterity with all the _éclat_ of a proverb.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am sure,”","Pride and Prejudice"
"said he. “How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend to say. _You_","Pride and Prejudice"
"think it a faithful portrait, undoubtedly.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I must not decide on my own performance.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"He made no answer; and they were again silent till they had gone down","Pride and Prejudice"
"the dance, when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often","Pride and Prejudice"
"walk to Meryton. She answered in the affirmative; and, unable to resist","Pride and Prejudice"
"the temptation, added, “When you met us there the other day, we had just","Pride and Prejudice"
"been forming a new acquaintance.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread his","Pride and Prejudice"
"features, but he said not a word; and Elizabeth, though blaming herself","Pride and Prejudice"
"for her own weakness, could not go on. At length Darcy spoke, and in a","Pride and Prejudice"
"constrained manner said,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Mr. Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may insure his","Pride and Prejudice"
"_making_ friends; whether he may be equally capable of _retaining_ them,","Pride and Prejudice"
"is less certain.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship,” replied Elizabeth,","Pride and Prejudice"
"with emphasis, “and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all","Pride and Prejudice"
"his life.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the subject. At","Pride and Prejudice"
"that moment Sir William Lucas appeared close to them, meaning to pass","Pride and Prejudice"
"through the set to the other side of the room; but, on perceiving Mr.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Darcy, he stopped, with a bow of superior courtesy, to compliment him on","Pride and Prejudice"
"his dancing and his partner.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I have been most highly gratified, indeed, my dear sir; such very","Pride and Prejudice"
"superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong to the","Pride and Prejudice"
"first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair partner does not","Pride and Prejudice"
"disgrace you: and that I must hope to have this pleasure often repeated,","Pride and Prejudice"
"especially when a certain desirable event, my dear Miss Eliza (glancing","Pride and Prejudice"
"at her sister and Bingley), shall take place. What congratulations will","Pride and Prejudice"
"then flow in! I appeal to Mr. Darcy;--but let me not interrupt you, sir.","Pride and Prejudice"
"You will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"

"and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“What think you of books?” said he, smiling.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Books--oh no!--I am sure we never read the same, or not with the same","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at least be","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“No--I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full of","Pride and Prejudice"
"something else.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes--does it?” said he,","Pride and Prejudice"
"with a look of doubt.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yes, always,” she replied, without knowing what she said; for her","Pride and Prejudice"
"thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon afterwards appeared","Pride and Prejudice"
"by her suddenly exclaiming, “I remember hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy,","Pride and Prejudice"
"that you hardly ever forgave;--that your resentment, once created, was","Pride and Prejudice"
"unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its _being","Pride and Prejudice"
"created_?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I am,” said he, with a firm voice.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I hope not.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their opinion,","Pride and Prejudice"
"to be secure of judging properly at first.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“May I ask to what these questions tend?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Merely to the illustration of _your_ character,” said she, endeavouring","Pride and Prejudice"
"to shake off her gravity. “I am trying to make it out.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“And what is your success?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She shook her head. “I do not get on at all. I hear such different","Pride and Prejudice"
"accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I can readily believe,” answered he, gravely, “that reports may vary","Pride and Prejudice"
"greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet, that you were","Pride and Prejudice"
"not to sketch my character at the present moment, as there is reason to","Pride and Prejudice"
"fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another","Pride and Prejudice"
"opportunity.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,” he coldly replied.","Pride and Prejudice"
"She said no more, and they went down the other dance and parted in","Pride and Prejudice"
"silence; on each side dissatisfied, though not to an equal degree; for","Pride and Prejudice"
"in Darcy’s breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her,","Pride and Prejudice"
"which soon procured her pardon, and directed all his anger against","Pride and Prejudice"
"another.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"They had not long separated when Miss Bingley came towards her, and,","Pride and Prejudice"
"with an expression of civil disdain, thus accosted her,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George Wickham?","Pride and Prejudice"
"Your sister has been talking to me about him, and asking me a thousand","Pride and Prejudice"
"questions; and I find that the young man forgot to tell you, among his","Pride and Prejudice"
"other communications, that he was the son of old Wickham, the late Mr.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Darcy’s steward. Let me recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give","Pride and Prejudice"
"implicit confidence to all his assertions; for, as to Mr. Darcy’s using","Pride and Prejudice"
"him ill, it is perfectly false: for, on the contrary, he has been always","Pride and Prejudice"
"remarkably kind to him, though George Wickham has treated Mr. Darcy in a","Pride and Prejudice"
"most infamous manner. I do not know the particulars, but I know very","Pride and Prejudice"
"well that Mr. Darcy is not in the least to blame; that he cannot bear","Pride and Prejudice"
"to hear George Wickham mentioned; and that though my brother thought he","Pride and Prejudice"
"could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers, he","Pride and Prejudice"
"was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way.","Pride and Prejudice"
"His coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing, indeed, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"I wonder how he could presume to do it. I pity you, Miss Eliza, for this","Pride and Prejudice"
"discovery of your favourite’s guilt; but really, considering his","Pride and Prejudice"
"descent, one could not expect much better.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“His guilt and his descent appear, by your account, to be the same,”","Pride and Prejudice"
"said Elizabeth, angrily; “for I have heard you accuse him of nothing","Pride and Prejudice"
"worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy’s steward, and of _that_, I can","Pride and Prejudice"
"assure you, he informed me himself.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I beg your pardon,” replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a sneer.","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Excuse my interference; it was kindly meant.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Insolent girl!” said Elizabeth to herself. “You are much mistaken if","Pride and Prejudice"
"you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this. I see","Pride and Prejudice"
"nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of Mr.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Darcy.” She then sought her eldest sister, who had undertaken to make","Pride and Prejudice"
"inquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane met her with a smile of","Pride and Prejudice"
"such sweet complacency, a glow of such happy expression, as sufficiently","Pride and Prejudice"
"marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth instantly read her feelings; and, at that moment, solicitude","Pride and Prejudice"
"for Wickham, resentment against his enemies, and everything else, gave","Pride and Prejudice"
"way before the hope of Jane’s being in the fairest way for happiness.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I want to know,” said she, with a countenance no less smiling than her","Pride and Prejudice"
"sister’s, “what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But perhaps you have","Pride and Prejudice"
"been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person, in which case","Pride and Prejudice"
"you may be sure of my pardon.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“No,” replied Jane, “I have not forgotten him; but I have nothing","Pride and Prejudice"
"satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of his","Pride and Prejudice"
"history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have","Pride and Prejudice"
"principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he will vouch for the good conduct,","Pride and Prejudice"
"the probity and honour, of his friend, and is perfectly convinced that","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Wickham has deserved much less attention from Mr. Darcy than he has","Pride and Prejudice"
"received; and I am sorry to say that by his account, as well as his","Pride and Prejudice"
"sister’s, Mr. Wickham is by no means a respectable young man. I am","Pride and Prejudice"
"afraid he has been very imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"regard.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“No; he never saw him till the other morning at Meryton.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“This account then is what he has received from Mr. Darcy. I am","Pride and Prejudice"
"perfectly satisfied. But what does he say of the living?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“He does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he has heard","Pride and Prejudice"
"them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he believes that it was left to","Pride and Prejudice"
"him _conditionally_ only.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley’s sincerity,” said Elizabeth warmly,","Pride and Prejudice"
"“but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only. Mr.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bingley’s defence of his friend was a very able one, I dare say; but","Pride and Prejudice"
"since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story, and has learnt","Pride and Prejudice"
"the rest from that friend himself, I shall venture still to think of","Pride and Prejudice"
"both gentlemen as I did before.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each, and on","Pride and Prejudice"
"which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth listened with","Pride and Prejudice"
"delight to the happy though modest hopes which Jane entertained of","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bingley’s regard, and said all in her power to heighten her confidence","Pride and Prejudice"
"in it. On their being joined by Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew","Pride and Prejudice"
"to Miss Lucas; to whose inquiry after the pleasantness of her last","Pride and Prejudice"
"partner she had scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and told her with great exultation, that he had just been so fortunate","Pride and Prejudice"
"as to make a most important discovery.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I have found out,” said he, “by a singular accident, that there is now","Pride and Prejudice"
"in the room a near relation to my patroness. I happened to overhear the","Pride and Prejudice"
"gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of","Pride and Prejudice"
"this house the names of his cousin Miss De Bourgh, and of her mother,","Pride and Prejudice"
"Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these sort of things occur! Who would","Pride and Prejudice"
"have thought of my meeting with--perhaps--a nephew of Lady Catherine de","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bourgh in this assembly! I am most thankful that the discovery is made","Pride and Prejudice"
"in time for me to pay my respects to him, which I am now going to do,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and trust he will excuse my not having done it before. My total","Pride and Prejudice"
"ignorance of the connection must plead my apology.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Indeed I am. I shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier.","Pride and Prejudice"
"I believe him to be Lady Catherine’s _nephew_. It will be in my power to","Pride and Prejudice"
"assure him that her Ladyship was quite well yesterday se’nnight.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme; assuring him","Pride and Prejudice"
"that Mr. Darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as","Pride and Prejudice"
"an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment to his aunt; that it","Pride and Prejudice"
"was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either","Pride and Prejudice"
"side, and that if it were, it must belong to Mr. Darcy, the superior in","Pride and Prejudice"
"consequence, to begin the acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her with","Pride and Prejudice"
"the determined air of following his own inclination, and when she ceased","Pride and Prejudice"
"speaking, replied thus,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world of your","Pride and Prejudice"
"excellent judgment in all matters within the scope of your","Pride and Prejudice"
"understanding, but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference","Pride and Prejudice"
"between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those","Pride and Prejudice"
"which regulate the clergy; for, give me leave to observe that I consider","Pride and Prejudice"
"the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank","Pride and Prejudice"
"in the kingdom--provided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the","Pride and Prejudice"
"same time maintained. You must, therefore, allow me to follow the","Pride and Prejudice"
"dictates of my conscience on this occasion, which lead me to perform","Pride and Prejudice"
"what I look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by","Pride and Prejudice"
"your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant guide,","Pride and Prejudice"
"though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted by education","Pride and Prejudice"
"and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like","Pride and Prejudice"
"yourself;” and with a low bow he left her to attack Mr. Darcy, whose","Pride and Prejudice"
"reception of his advances she eagerly watched, and whose astonishment at","Pride and Prejudice"
"being so addressed was very evident. Her cousin prefaced his speech with","Pride and Prejudice"
"a solemn bow, and though she could not hear a word of it, she felt as if","Pride and Prejudice"
"hearing it all, and saw in the motion of his lips the words “apology,”","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Hunsford,” and “Lady Catherine de Bourgh.” It vexed her to see him","Pride and Prejudice"
"expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him with","Pride and Prejudice"
"unrestrained wonder; and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him to speak,","Pride and Prejudice"
"replied with an air of distant civility. Mr. Collins, however, was not","Pride and Prejudice"
"discouraged from speaking again, and Mr. Darcy’s contempt seemed","Pride and Prejudice"
"abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech; and at the","Pride and Prejudice"
"end of it he only made him a slight bow, and moved another way: Mr.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Collins then returned to Elizabeth.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I have no reason, I assure you,” said he, “to be dissatisfied with my","Pride and Prejudice"
"reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the attention. He answered","Pride and Prejudice"
"me with the utmost civility, and even paid me the compliment of saying,","Pride and Prejudice"
"that he was so well convinced of Lady Catherine’s discernment as to be","Pride and Prejudice"
"certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily. It was really a very","Pride and Prejudice"
"handsome thought. Upon the whole, I am much pleased with him.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue, she turned","Pride and Prejudice"
"her attention almost entirely on her sister and Mr. Bingley; and the","Pride and Prejudice"
"train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made","Pride and Prejudice"
"her perhaps almost as happy as Jane. She saw her in idea settled in that","Pride and Prejudice"
"very house, in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could","Pride and Prejudice"
"bestow; and she felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring","Pride and Prejudice"
"even to like Bingley’s two sisters. Her mother’s thoughts she plainly","Pride and Prejudice"
"saw were bent the same way, and she determined not to venture near her,","Pride and Prejudice"
"lest she might hear too much. When they sat down to supper, therefore,","Pride and Prejudice"
"she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within","Pride and Prejudice"
"one of each other; and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was","Pride and Prejudice"
"talking to that one person (Lady Lucas) freely, openly, and of nothing","Pride and Prejudice"
"else but of her expectation that Jane would be soon married to Mr.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bingley. It was an animating subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable","Pride and Prejudice"
"of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match. His being such","Pride and Prejudice"
"a charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from them,","Pride and Prejudice"
"were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was such a","Pride and Prejudice"
"comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane, and to be","Pride and Prejudice"
"certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do. It","Pride and Prejudice"
"was, moreover, such a promising thing for her younger daughters, as","Pride and Prejudice"
"Jane’s marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men;","Pride and Prejudice"
"and, lastly, it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to","Pride and Prejudice"
"consign her single daughters to the care of their sister, that she might","Pride and Prejudice"
"not be obliged to go into company more than she liked. It was necessary","Pride and Prejudice"
"to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such","Pride and Prejudice"
"occasions it is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bennet to find comfort in staying at home at any period of her life. She","Pride and Prejudice"
"concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be equally","Pride and Prejudice"
"fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no","Pride and Prejudice"
"chance of it.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"words, or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible","Pride and Prejudice"
"whisper; for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the","Pride and Prejudice"
"chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy, who sat opposite to them. Her","Pride and Prejudice"
"mother only scolded her for being nonsensical.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him? I am","Pride and Prejudice"
"sure we owe him no such particular civility as to be obliged to say","Pride and Prejudice"
"nothing _he_ may not like to hear.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“For heaven’s sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be to you","Pride and Prejudice"
"to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to his friend by","Pride and Prejudice"
"so doing.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Nothing that she could say, however, had any influence. Her mother would","Pride and Prejudice"
"talk of her views in the same intelligible tone. Elizabeth blushed and","Pride and Prejudice"
"blushed again with shame and vexation. She could not help frequently","Pride and Prejudice"
"glancing her eye at Mr. Darcy, though every glance convinced her of what","Pride and Prejudice"
"she dreaded; for though he was not always looking at her mother, she was","Pride and Prejudice"
"convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her. The expression","Pride and Prejudice"
"of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and","Pride and Prejudice"
"steady gravity.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady Lucas, who","Pride and Prejudice"
"had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no","Pride and Prejudice"
"likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth now began to revive. But not long was the interval of","Pride and Prejudice"
"tranquillity; for when supper was over, singing was talked of, and she","Pride and Prejudice"
"had the mortification of seeing Mary, after very little entreaty,","Pride and Prejudice"
"preparing to oblige the company. By many significant looks and silent","Pride and Prejudice"
"entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of","Pride and Prejudice"
"complaisance,--but in vain; Mary would not understand them; such an","Pride and Prejudice"
"opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her, and she began her song.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth’s eyes were fixed on her, with most painful sensations; and","Pride and Prejudice"
"she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience","Pride and Prejudice"
"which was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving","Pride and Prejudice"
"amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be","Pride and Prejudice"
"prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of half a minute","Pride and Prejudice"
"began another. Mary’s powers were by no means fitted for such a display;","Pride and Prejudice"
"her voice was weak, and her manner affected. Elizabeth was in agonies.","Pride and Prejudice"
"She looked at Jane to see how she bore it; but Jane was very composedly","Pride and Prejudice"
"talking to Bingley. She looked at his two sisters, and saw them making","Pride and Prejudice"
"signs of derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,","Pride and Prejudice"
"impenetrably grave. She looked at her father to entreat his","Pride and Prejudice"
"interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He took the hint,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and, when Mary had finished her second song, said aloud,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long enough.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted; and","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth, sorry for her, and sorry for her father’s speech, was afraid","Pride and Prejudice"
"her anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were now applied to.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“If I,” said Mr. Collins, “were so fortunate as to be able to sing, I","Pride and Prejudice"
"should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the company with an","Pride and Prejudice"
"air; for I consider music as a very innocent diversion, and perfectly","Pride and Prejudice"
"compatible with the profession of a clergyman. I do not mean, however,","Pride and Prejudice"
"to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to","Pride and Prejudice"
"music, for there are certainly other things to be attended to. The","Pride and Prejudice"
"rector of a parish has much to do. In the first place, he must make such","Pride and Prejudice"
"an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not","Pride and Prejudice"
"offensive to his patron. He must write his own sermons; and the time","Pride and Prejudice"
"that remains will not be too much for his parish duties, and the care","Pride and Prejudice"
"and improvement of his dwelling, which he cannot be excused from making","Pride and Prejudice"
"as comfortable as possible. And I do not think it of light importance","Pride and Prejudice"
"that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards","Pride and Prejudice"
"everybody, especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment. I","Pride and Prejudice"
"cannot acquit him of that duty; nor could I think well of the man who","Pride and Prejudice"
"should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody","Pride and Prejudice"
"connected with the family.” And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he concluded","Pride and Prejudice"
"his speech, which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the","Pride and Prejudice"
"room. Many stared--many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bennet himself, while his wife seriously commended Mr. Collins for","Pride and Prejudice"
"having spoken so sensibly, and observed, in a half-whisper to Lady","Pride and Prejudice"
"Lucas, that he was a remarkably clever, good kind of young man.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"To Elizabeth it appeared, that had her family made an agreement to","Pride and Prejudice"
"expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it would","Pride and Prejudice"
"have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit, or","Pride and Prejudice"
"finer success; and happy did she think it for Bingley and her sister","Pride and Prejudice"
"that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice, and that his","Pride and Prejudice"
"feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he","Pride and Prejudice"
"must have witnessed. That his two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should","Pride and Prejudice"
"have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough; and","Pride and Prejudice"
"she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman, or","Pride and Prejudice"
"the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The rest of the evening brought her little amusement. She was teased by","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her side; and though he","Pride and Prejudice"
"could not prevail with her to dance with him again, put it out of her","Pride and Prejudice"
"power to dance with others. In vain did she entreat him to stand up with","Pride and Prejudice"
"somebody else, and offered to introduce him to any young lady in the","Pride and Prejudice"
"room. He assured her that, as to dancing, he was perfectly indifferent","Pride and Prejudice"
"to it; that his chief object was, by delicate attentions, to recommend","Pride and Prejudice"
"himself to her; and that he should therefore make a point of remaining","Pride and Prejudice"
"close to her the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a","Pride and Prejudice"
"project. She owed her greatest relief to her friend Miss Lucas, who","Pride and Prejudice"
"often joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins’s conversation","Pride and Prejudice"
"to herself.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She was at least free from the offence of Mr. Darcy’s further notice:","Pride and Prejudice"
"though often standing within a very short distance of her, quite","Pride and Prejudice"
"disengaged, he never came near enough to speak. She felt it to be the","Pride and Prejudice"
"probable consequence of her allusions to Mr. Wickham, and rejoiced in","Pride and Prejudice"
"it.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart; and by a","Pride and Prejudice"
"manœuvre of Mrs. Bennet had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an","Pride and Prejudice"
"hour after everybody else was gone, which gave them time to see how","Pride and Prejudice"
"heartily they were wished away by some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her","Pride and Prejudice"
"sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed","Pride and Prejudice"
"every attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and, by so doing, threw a","Pride and Prejudice"
"languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by the long","Pride and Prejudice"
"speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr. Bingley and his","Pride and Prejudice"
"sisters on the elegance of their entertainment, and the hospitality and","Pride and Prejudice"
"politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests. Darcy said","Pride and Prejudice"
"nothing at all. Mr. Bennet, in equal silence, was enjoying the scene.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Bingley and Jane were standing together a little detached from the","Pride and Prejudice"
"rest, and talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a","Pride and Prejudice"
"silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was too","Pride and Prejudice"
"much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of “Lord,","Pride and Prejudice"
"how tired I am!” accompanied by a violent yawn.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most pressingly","Pride and Prejudice"
"civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at Longbourn; and","Pride and Prejudice"
"addressed herself particularly to Mr. Bingley, to assure him how happy","Pride and Prejudice"
"he would make them, by eating a family dinner with them at any time,","Pride and Prejudice"
"without the ceremony of a formal invitation. Bingley was all grateful","Pride and Prejudice"
"pleasure; and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of","Pride and Prejudice"
"waiting on her after his return from London, whither he was obliged to","Pride and Prejudice"
"go the next day for a short time.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied; and quitted the house under the","Pride and Prejudice"
"delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary preparations of","Pride and Prejudice"
"settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes, she should undoubtedly","Pride and Prejudice"
"see her daughter settled at Netherfield in the course of three or four","Pride and Prejudice"
"months. Of having another daughter married to Mr. Collins she thought","Pride and Prejudice"
"with equal certainty, and with considerable, though not equal, pleasure.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children; and though the","Pride and Prejudice"
"man and the match were quite good enough for _her_, the worth of each","Pride and Prejudice"
"was eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his","Pride and Prejudice"
"declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as","Pride and Prejudice"
"his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having","Pride and Prejudice"
"no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the","Pride and Prejudice"
"moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the","Pride and Prejudice"
"observances which he supposed a regular part of the business. On finding","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon","Pride and Prejudice"
"after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,","Pride and Prejudice"
"when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the","Pride and Prejudice"
"course of this morning?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bennet instantly answered,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Oh dear! Yes, certainly. I am sure Lizzy will be very happy--I am sure","Pride and Prejudice"
"she can have no objection. Come, Kitty, I want you upstairs.” And","Pride and Prejudice"
"gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth","Pride and Prejudice"
"called out,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Dear ma’am, do not go. I beg you will not go. Mr. Collins must excuse","Pride and Prejudice"
"me. He can have nothing to say to me that anybody need not hear. I am","Pride and Prejudice"
"going away myself.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“No, no, nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you will stay where you are.” And","Pride and Prejudice"
"upon Elizabeth’s seeming really, with vexed and embarrassed looks, about","Pride and Prejudice"
"to escape, she added, “Lizzy, I _insist_ upon your staying and hearing","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Collins.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth would not oppose such an injunction; and a moment’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it","Pride and Prejudice"
"over as soon and as quietly as possible, she sat down again, and tried","Pride and Prejudice"
"to conceal, by incessant employment, the feelings which were divided","Pride and Prejudice"
"between distress and diversion. Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as","Pride and Prejudice"
"soon as they were gone, Mr. Collins began,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from","Pride and Prejudice"
"doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections. You","Pride and Prejudice"
"would have been less amiable in my eyes had there _not_ been this little","Pride and Prejudice"
"unwillingness; but allow me to assure you that I have your respected","Pride and Prejudice"
"mother’s permission for this address. You can hardly doubt the purport","Pride and Prejudice"
"of my discourse, however your natural delicacy may lead you to","Pride and Prejudice"
"dissemble; my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken. Almost as","Pride and Prejudice"
"soon as I entered the house I singled you out as the companion of my","Pride and Prejudice"
"future life. But before I am run away with by my feelings on this","Pride and Prejudice"
"subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for","Pride and Prejudice"
"marrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design","Pride and Prejudice"
"of selecting a wife, as I certainly did.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away","Pride and Prejudice"
"with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not","Pride and Prejudice"
"use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"he continued,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for","Pride and Prejudice"
"every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example","Pride and Prejudice"
"of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced it will add","Pride and Prejudice"
"very greatly to my happiness; and, thirdly, which perhaps I ought to","Pride and Prejudice"
"have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and","Pride and Prejudice"
"recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling","Pride and Prejudice"
"patroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked","Pride and Prejudice"
"too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I","Pride and Prejudice"
"left Hunsford,--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was","Pride and Prejudice"
"arranging Miss De Bourgh’s footstool,--that she said, ‘Mr. Collins, you","Pride and Prejudice"
"must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose a","Pride and Prejudice"
"gentlewoman for _my_ sake, and for your _own_; let her be an active,","Pride and Prejudice"
"useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small","Pride and Prejudice"
"income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as","Pride and Prejudice"
"you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.’ Allow me, by the","Pride and Prejudice"
"way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and","Pride and Prejudice"
"kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the","Pride and Prejudice"
"advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond","Pride and Prejudice"
"anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be","Pride and Prejudice"
"acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect","Pride and Prejudice"
"which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general","Pride and Prejudice"
"intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views","Pride and Prejudice"
"were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I","Pride and Prejudice"
"assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that","Pride and Prejudice"
"being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured","Pride and Prejudice"
"father (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy","Pride and Prejudice"
"myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that","Pride and Prejudice"
"the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy","Pride and Prejudice"
"event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be","Pride and Prejudice"
"for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I","Pride and Prejudice"
"flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing","Pride and Prejudice"
"remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the","Pride and Prejudice"
"violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well","Pride and Prejudice"
"aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds","Pride and Prejudice"
"in the 4 per cents., which will not be yours till after your mother’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,","Pride and Prejudice"
"therefore, I shall be uniformly silent: and you may assure yourself that","Pride and Prejudice"
"no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You are too hasty, sir,” she cried. “You forget that I have made no","Pride and Prejudice"
"answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for","Pride and Prejudice"
"the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of","Pride and Prejudice"
"your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline","Pride and Prejudice"
"them.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I am not now to learn,” replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the","Pride and Prejudice"
"hand, “that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the","Pride and Prejudice"
"man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their","Pride and Prejudice"
"favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a","Pride and Prejudice"
"third time. I am, therefore, by no means discouraged by what you have","Pride and Prejudice"
"just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Upon my word, sir,” cried Elizabeth, “your hope is rather an","Pride and Prejudice"
"extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not","Pride and Prejudice"
"one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so","Pride and Prejudice"
"daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second","Pride and Prejudice"
"time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make _me_","Pride and Prejudice"
"happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who","Pride and Prejudice"
"would make _you_ so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I","Pride and Prejudice"
"am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the","Pride and Prejudice"
"situation.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,” said Mr. Collins,","Pride and Prejudice"
"very gravely--“but I cannot imagine that her Ladyship would at all","Pride and Prejudice"
"disapprove of you. And you may be certain that when I have the honour of","Pride and Prejudice"
"seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty,","Pride and Prejudice"
"economy, and other amiable qualifications.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You must","Pride and Prejudice"
"give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of","Pride and Prejudice"
"believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by","Pride and Prejudice"
"refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.","Pride and Prejudice"
"In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your","Pride and Prejudice"
"feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn","Pride and Prejudice"
"estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may be","Pride and Prejudice"
"considered, therefore, as finally settled.” And rising as she thus","Pride and Prejudice"
"spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr. Collins thus","Pride and Prejudice"
"addressed her,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I","Pride and Prejudice"
"shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given","Pride and Prejudice"
"me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I","Pride and Prejudice"
"know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the","Pride and Prejudice"
"first application, and, perhaps, you have even now said as much to","Pride and Prejudice"
"encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the","Pride and Prejudice"
"female character.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Really, Mr. Collins,” cried Elizabeth, with some warmth, “you puzzle me","Pride and Prejudice"
"exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form","Pride and Prejudice"
"of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as","Pride and Prejudice"
"may convince you of its being one.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your","Pride and Prejudice"
"refusal of my addresses are merely words of course. My reasons for","Pride and Prejudice"
"believing it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my hand","Pride and Prejudice"
"is unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would","Pride and Prejudice"
"be any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections","Pride and Prejudice"
"with the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are","Pride and Prejudice"
"circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further","Pride and Prejudice"
"consideration that, in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no","Pride and Prejudice"
"means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your","Pride and Prejudice"
"portion is unhappily so small, that it will in all likelihood undo the","Pride and Prejudice"
"effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must,","Pride and Prejudice"
"therefore, conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I","Pride and Prejudice"
"shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by","Pride and Prejudice"
"suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind","Pride and Prejudice"
"of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would","Pride and Prejudice"
"rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you","Pride and Prejudice"
"again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but","Pride and Prejudice"
"to accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect","Pride and Prejudice"
"forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant","Pride and Prejudice"
"female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the","Pride and Prejudice"
"truth from her heart.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You are uniformly charming!” cried he, with an air of awkward","Pride and Prejudice"
"gallantry; “and I am persuaded that, when sanctioned by the express","Pride and Prejudice"
"authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of","Pride and Prejudice"
"being acceptable.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no","Pride and Prejudice"
"reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, that if he","Pride and Prejudice"
"persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering","Pride and Prejudice"
"encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered","Pride and Prejudice"
"in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could","Pride and Prejudice"
"not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.","Pride and Prejudice"

"Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his","Pride and Prejudice"
"successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule","Pride and Prejudice"
"to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the","Pride and Prejudice"
"door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she","Pride and Prejudice"
"entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in","Pride and Prejudice"
"warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collins","Pride and Prejudice"
"received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then","Pride and Prejudice"
"proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result","Pride and Prejudice"
"of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the","Pride and Prejudice"
"refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow","Pride and Prejudice"
"from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet: she would have been","Pride and Prejudice"
"glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage","Pride and Prejudice"
"him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and could not help saying so.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“But depend upon it, Mr. Collins,” she added, “that Lizzy shall be","Pride and Prejudice"
"brought to reason. I will speak to her about it myself directly. She is","Pride and Prejudice"
"a very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but","Pride and Prejudice"
"I will _make_ her know it.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,” cried Mr. Collins; “but if she","Pride and Prejudice"
"is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would","Pride and Prejudice"
"altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who","Pride and Prejudice"
"naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If, therefore, she","Pride and Prejudice"
"actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to","Pride and Prejudice"
"force her into accepting me, because, if liable to such defects of","Pride and Prejudice"
"temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Sir, you quite misunderstand me,” said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. “Lizzy is","Pride and Prejudice"
"only headstrong in such matters as these. In everything else she is as","Pride and Prejudice"
"good-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Oh, Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.","Pride and Prejudice"
"You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will","Pride and Prejudice"
"not have him; and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and","Pride and Prejudice"
"not have _her_.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them","Pride and Prejudice"
"on her face with a calm unconcern, which was not in the least altered by","Pride and Prejudice"
"her communication.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I have not the pleasure of understanding you,” said he, when she had","Pride and Prejudice"
"finished her speech. “Of what are you talking?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems a hopeless business.”","Pride and Prejudice"

"“Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the","Pride and Prejudice"
"library.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Come here, child,” cried her father as she appeared. “I have sent for","Pride and Prejudice"
"you on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made","Pride and Prejudice"
"you an offer of marriage. Is it true?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth replied that it was.","Pride and Prejudice"

"“Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I have, sir.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yes, or I will never see her again.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must","Pride and Prejudice"
"be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you","Pride and Prejudice"
"again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again","Pride and Prejudice"
"if you _do_.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning;","Pride and Prejudice"
"but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the","Pride and Prejudice"
"affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, by talking in this way? You promised me","Pride and Prejudice"
"to _insist_ upon her marrying him.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“My dear,” replied her husband, “I have two small favours to request.","Pride and Prejudice"
"First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the","Pride and Prejudice"
"present occasion; and, secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the","Pride and Prejudice"
"library to myself as soon as may be.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again;","Pride and Prejudice"
"coaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane in","Pride and Prejudice"
"her interest, but Jane, with all possible mildness, declined","Pride and Prejudice"
"interfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks. Though her manner","Pride and Prejudice"
"varied, however, her determination never did.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.","Pride and Prejudice"
"He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin","Pride and Prejudice"
"could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other","Pride and Prejudice"

"While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend","Pride and Prejudice"

"the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating","Pride and Prejudice"
"her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of her","Pride and Prejudice"
"family. “Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,” she added, in a melancholy tone;","Pride and Prejudice"
"“for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me; I am cruelly used,","Pride and Prejudice"
"nobody feels for my poor nerves.”","Pride and Prejudice"

"Charlotte’s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.","Pride and Prejudice"

"“Ay, there she comes,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “looking as unconcerned as","Pride and Prejudice"
"may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided she","Pride and Prejudice"

"into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but","Pride and Prejudice"
"Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte,","Pride and Prejudice"
"detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after","Pride and Prejudice"
"herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little","Pride and Prejudice"
"curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending","Pride and Prejudice"
"not to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet thus began the projected","Pride and Prejudice"
"conversation:--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Oh, Mr. Collins!”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“My dear madam,” replied he, “let us be for ever silent on this point.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Far be it from me,” he presently continued, in a voice that marked his","Pride and Prejudice"
"displeasure, “to resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation to","Pride and Prejudice"
"inevitable evils is the duty of us all: the peculiar duty of a young man","Pride and Prejudice"
"who has been so fortunate as I have been, in early preferment; and, I","Pride and Prejudice"
"trust, I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my","Pride and Prejudice"
"positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I","Pride and Prejudice"
"have often observed, that resignation is never so perfect as when the","Pride and Prejudice"
"blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.","Pride and Prejudice"
"You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect to your","Pride and Prejudice"
"family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your","Pride and Prejudice"
"daughter’s favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the","Pride and Prejudice"
"compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.","Pride and Prejudice"
"My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my","Pride and Prejudice"
"dismission from your daughter’s lips instead of your own; but we are all","Pride and Prejudice"
"liable to error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.","Pride and Prejudice"
"My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The discussion of Mr. Collins’s offer was now nearly at an end, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily","Pride and Prejudice"
"attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.","Pride and Prejudice"
"As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not","Pride and Prejudice"
"by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by","Pride and Prejudice"
"stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke to","Pride and Prejudice"
"her; and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of","Pride and Prejudice"
"himself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose","Pride and Prejudice"
"civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"especially to her friend.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet’s ill humour or ill","Pride and Prejudice"
"health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth","Pride and Prejudice"
"had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did","Pride and Prejudice"
"not appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on","Pride and Prejudice"
"Saturday, and to Saturday he still meant to stay.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton, to inquire if Mr. Wickham","Pride and Prejudice"
"were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.","Pride and Prejudice"
"He joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their","Pride and Prejudice"
"aunt’s, where his regret and vexation and the concern of everybody were","Pride and Prejudice"
"well talked over. To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged","Pride and Prejudice"
"that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self-imposed.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I found,” said he, “as the time drew near, that I had better not meet","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so","Pride and Prejudice"
"many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes","Pride and Prejudice"
"might arise unpleasant to more than myself.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She highly approved his forbearance; and they had leisure for a full","Pride and Prejudice"
"discussion of it, and for all the commendations which they civilly","Pride and Prejudice"
"bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with","Pride and Prejudice"
"them to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to her.","Pride and Prejudice"
"His accompanying them was a double advantage: she felt all the","Pride and Prejudice"
"compliment it offered to herself; and it was most acceptable as an","Pride and Prejudice"
"occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"[Illustration: “Walked back with them”","Pride and Prejudice"

"[_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came","Pride and Prejudice"
"from Netherfield, and was opened immediately. The envelope contained a","Pride and Prejudice"
"sheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister’s countenance change as","Pride and Prejudice"
"she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Jane recollected herself soon; and putting the letter away, tried to","Pride and Prejudice"
"join, with her usual cheerfulness, in the general conversation: but","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention","Pride and Prejudice"
"even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave,","Pride and Prejudice"
"than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her upstairs. When they","Pride and Prejudice"
"had gained their own room, Jane, taking out her letter, said, “This is","Pride and Prejudice"
"from Caroline Bingley: what it contains has surprised me a good deal.","Pride and Prejudice"
"The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way","Pride and Prejudice"
"to town; and without any intention of coming back again. You shall hear","Pride and Prejudice"
"what she says.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information","Pride and Prejudice"
"of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor Street, where Mr.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Hurst had a house. The next was in these words:--“‘I do not pretend to","Pride and Prejudice"
"regret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire except your society, my","Pride and Prejudice"
"dearest friend; but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many","Pride and Prejudice"
"returns of that delightful intercourse we have known, and in the","Pride and Prejudice"
"meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most","Pride and Prejudice"
"unreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that.’” To these","Pride and Prejudice"
"high-flown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of","Pride and Prejudice"
"distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she","Pride and Prejudice"
"saw nothing in it really to lament: it was not to be supposed that their","Pride and Prejudice"
"absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley’s being there; and as","Pride and Prejudice"
"to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon","Pride and Prejudice"
"cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“It is unlucky,” said she, after a short pause, “that you should not be","Pride and Prejudice"
"able to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not","Pride and Prejudice"
"hope that the period of future happiness, to which Miss Bingley looks","Pride and Prejudice"
"forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful","Pride and Prejudice"
"intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater","Pride and Prejudice"
"satisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by","Pride and Prejudice"
"them.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into","Pride and Prejudice"
"Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“‘When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which","Pride and Prejudice"
"took him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we","Pride and Prejudice"
"are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when","Pride and Prejudice"
"Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have","Pride and Prejudice"
"determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend","Pride and Prejudice"
"his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintance are","Pride and Prejudice"
"already there for the winter: I wish I could hear that you, my dearest","Pride and Prejudice"
"friend, had any intention of making one in the crowd, but of that I","Pride and Prejudice"
"despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in","Pride and Prejudice"
"the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux","Pride and Prejudice"
"will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of","Pride and Prejudice"
"whom we shall deprive you.’","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“It is evident by this,” added Jane, “that he comes back no more this","Pride and Prejudice"
"winter.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _should_.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Why will you think so? It must be his own doing; he is his own master.","Pride and Prejudice"
"But you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage which","Pride and Prejudice"
"particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_. ‘Mr. Darcy is","Pride and Prejudice"
"impatient to see his sister; and to confess the truth, _we_ are scarcely","Pride and Prejudice"
"less eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has","Pride and Prejudice"
"her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection","Pride and Prejudice"
"she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still","Pride and Prejudice"
"more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being","Pride and Prejudice"
"hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to","Pride and Prejudice"
"you my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the country","Pride and Prejudice"
"without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them","Pride and Prejudice"
"unreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already; he will have","Pride and Prejudice"
"frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her","Pride and Prejudice"
"relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most","Pride and Prejudice"
"capable of engaging any woman’s heart. With all these circumstances to","Pride and Prejudice"
"favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest","Pride and Prejudice"
"Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness","Pride and Prejudice"
"of so many?’ What think you of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?” said","Pride and Prejudice"
"Jane, as she finished it. “Is it not clear enough? Does it not expressly","Pride and Prejudice"
"declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister;","Pride and Prejudice"
"that she is perfectly convinced of her brother’s indifference; and that","Pride and Prejudice"
"if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means (most","Pride and Prejudice"
"kindly!) to put me on my guard. Can there be any other opinion on the","Pride and Prejudice"
"subject?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Most willingly.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is","Pride and Prejudice"
"in love with you and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him to","Pride and Prejudice"
"town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he","Pride and Prejudice"
"does not care about you.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Jane shook her head.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you","Pride and Prejudice"
"together can doubt his affection; Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot: she","Pride and Prejudice"
"is not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the","Pride and Prejudice"
"case is this:--we are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she","Pride and Prejudice"
"is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion","Pride and Prejudice"
"that when there has been _one_ inter-marriage, she may have less trouble","Pride and Prejudice"
"in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I","Pride and Prejudice"
"dare say it would succeed if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But, my","Pride and Prejudice"
"dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that, because Miss Bingley","Pride and Prejudice"
"tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest","Pride and Prejudice"
"degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on","Pride and Prejudice"
"Tuesday; or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead","Pride and Prejudice"
"of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,” replied Jane, “your","Pride and Prejudice"
"representation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know the","Pride and Prejudice"
"foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving","Pride and Prejudice"
"anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived","Pride and Prejudice"
"herself.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you","Pride and Prejudice"
"will not take comfort in mine: believe her to be deceived, by all means.","Pride and Prejudice"
"You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in","Pride and Prejudice"
"accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry","Pride and Prejudice"
"elsewhere?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You must decide for yourself,” said Elizabeth; “and if, upon mature","Pride and Prejudice"
"deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is","Pride and Prejudice"
"more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you,","Pride and Prejudice"
"by all means, to refuse him.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“How can you talk so?” said Jane, faintly smiling; “you must know, that,","Pride and Prejudice"
"though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could","Pride and Prejudice"
"not hesitate.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consider","Pride and Prejudice"
"your situation with much compassion.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be","Pride and Prejudice"
"required. A thousand things may arise in six months.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost","Pride and Prejudice"
"contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"interested wishes; and she could not for a moment suppose that those","Pride and Prejudice"
"wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man","Pride and Prejudice"
"so totally independent of everyone.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She represented to her sister, as forcibly as possible, what she felt on","Pride and Prejudice"
"the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Jane’s temper was not desponding; and she was gradually led to hope,","Pride and Prejudice"
"though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bingley would return to Netherfield, and answer every wish of her heart.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the","Pride and Prejudice"
"family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman’s conduct;","Pride and Prejudice"
"but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen","Pride and Prejudice"
"to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. After","Pride and Prejudice"
"lamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation of","Pride and Prejudice"
"thinking that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again, and soon dining at","Pride and Prejudice"
"Longbourn; and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration,","Pride and Prejudice"
"that, though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take","Pride and Prejudice"
"care to have two full courses.","Pride and Prejudice"

"The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases; and again, during the","Pride and Prejudice"
"chief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. “It keeps him in good","Pride and Prejudice"
"humour,” said she, “and I am more obliged to you than I can express.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was","Pride and Prejudice"
"very amiable; but Charlotte’s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth","Pride and Prejudice"
"had any conception of:--its object was nothing less than to secure her","Pride and Prejudice"
"from any return of Mr. Collins’s addresses, by engaging them towards","Pride and Prejudice"
"herself. Such was Miss Lucas’s scheme; and appearances were so","Pride and Prejudice"
"favourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost","Pride and Prejudice"
"sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon.","Pride and Prejudice"
"But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his","Pride and Prejudice"
"character; for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next","Pride and Prejudice"
"morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw","Pride and Prejudice"
"himself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,","Pride and Prejudice"
"from a conviction that, if they saw him depart, they could not fail to","Pride and Prejudice"
"conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known","Pride and Prejudice"
"till its success could be known likewise; for, though feeling almost","Pride and Prejudice"
"secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,","Pride and Prejudice"
"he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday. His","Pride and Prejudice"
"reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas","Pride and Prejudice"
"perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had","Pride and Prejudice"
"she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"In as short a time as Mr. Collins’s long speeches would allow,","Pride and Prejudice"
"everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as","Pride and Prejudice"
"they entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that","Pride and Prejudice"
"was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must","Pride and Prejudice"
"be waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with","Pride and Prejudice"
"his happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must","Pride and Prejudice"
"guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its","Pride and Prejudice"
"continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and","Pride and Prejudice"
"disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that","Pride and Prejudice"
"establishment were gained.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;","Pride and Prejudice"
"and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins’s present","Pride and Prejudice"
"circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom","Pride and Prejudice"

"excited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and","Pride and Prejudice"
"Sir William gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins","Pride and Prejudice"

"expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St.","Pride and Prejudice"
"James’s. The whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the","Pride and Prejudice"
"occasion. The younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two","Pride and Prejudice"
"sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved","Pride and Prejudice"
"from their apprehension of Charlotte’s dying an old maid. Charlotte","Pride and Prejudice"
"herself was tolerably composed. She had gained her point, and had time","Pride and Prejudice"
"to consider of it. Her reflections were in general satisfactory. Mr.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor agreeable: his society was","Pride and Prejudice"
"irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary. But still he would","Pride and Prejudice"
"be her husband. Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony,","Pride and Prejudice"
"marriage had always been her object: it was the only honourable","Pride and Prejudice"
"provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and, however","Pride and Prejudice"
"uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative","Pride and Prejudice"
"from want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of","Pride and Prejudice"
"twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good","Pride and Prejudice"
"luck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business was the","Pride and Prejudice"
"surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she","Pride and Prejudice"
"valued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be","Pride and Prejudice"
"shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved","Pride and Prejudice"
"to give her the information herself; and therefore charged Mr. Collins,","Pride and Prejudice"
"when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had","Pride and Prejudice"
"passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very","Pride and Prejudice"
"dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the","Pride and Prejudice"
"curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct","Pride and Prejudice"
"questions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was","Pride and Prejudice"
"at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to","Pride and Prejudice"
"publish his prosperous love.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of","Pride and Prejudice"
"the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies","Pride and Prejudice"
"moved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and","Pride and Prejudice"
"cordiality, said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again,","Pride and Prejudice"
"whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“My dear madam,” he replied, “this invitation is particularly","Pride and Prejudice"
"gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you","Pride and Prejudice"
"may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as","Pride and Prejudice"
"possible.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for","Pride and Prejudice"
"so speedy a return, immediately said,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“But is there not danger of Lady Catherine’s disapprobation here, my","Pride and Prejudice"
"good sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the risk of","Pride and Prejudice"
"offending your patroness.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“My dear sir,” replied Mr. Collins, “I am particularly obliged to you","Pride and Prejudice"
"for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not taking so","Pride and Prejudice"
"material a step without her Ladyship’s concurrence.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You cannot be too much on your guard. Risk anything rather than her","Pride and Prejudice"
"displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us","Pride and Prejudice"
"again, which I should think exceedingly probable, stay quietly at home,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and be satisfied that _we_ shall take no offence.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such","Pride and Prejudice"
"affectionate attention; and, depend upon it, you will speedily receive","Pride and Prejudice"
"from me a letter of thanks for this as well as for every other mark of","Pride and Prejudice"
"your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my fair cousins,","Pride and Prejudice"
"though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary, I shall","Pride and Prejudice"
"now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness, not excepting","Pride and Prejudice"
"my cousin Elizabeth.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"With proper civilities, the ladies then withdrew; all of them equally","Pride and Prejudice"
"surprised to find that he meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet wished","Pride and Prejudice"
"to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of","Pride and Prejudice"
"her younger girls, and Mary might have been prevailed on to accept him.","Pride and Prejudice"
"She rated his abilities much higher than any of the others: there was a","Pride and Prejudice"
"solidity in his reflections which often struck her; and though by no","Pride and Prejudice"
"means so clever as herself, she thought that, if encouraged to read and","Pride and Prejudice"
"improve himself by such an example as hers, he might become a very","Pride and Prejudice"
"agreeable companion. But on the following morning every hope of this","Pride and Prejudice"
"kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast, and in a","Pride and Prejudice"
"private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The possibility of Mr. Collins’s fancying himself in love with her","Pride and Prejudice"
"friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two: but","Pride and Prejudice"
"that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility","Pride and Prejudice"
"as that she could encourage him herself; and her astonishment was","Pride and Prejudice"
"consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"she could not help crying out,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Engaged to Mr. Collins! my dear Charlotte, impossible!”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling her","Pride and Prejudice"
"story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a","Pride and Prejudice"
"reproach; though, as it was no more than she expected, she soon regained","Pride and Prejudice"
"her composure, and calmly replied,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it incredible","Pride and Prejudice"
"that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman’s good opinion,","Pride and Prejudice"
"because he was not so happy as to succeed with you?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"But Elizabeth had now recollected herself; and, making a strong effort","Pride and Prejudice"
"for it, was able to assure her, with tolerable firmness, that the","Pride and Prejudice"
"prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her, and that she","Pride and Prejudice"
"wished her all imaginable happiness.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I see what you are feeling,” replied Charlotte; “you must be surprised,","Pride and Prejudice"
"very much surprised, so lately as Mr. Collins was wishing to marry you.","Pride and Prejudice"
"But when you have had time to think it all over, I hope you will be","Pride and Prejudice"
"satisfied with what I have done. I am not romantic, you know. I never","Pride and Prejudice"

"Elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters, reflecting on what","Pride and Prejudice"
"she had heard, and doubting whether she was authorized to mention it,","Pride and Prejudice"
"when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his daughter to","Pride and Prejudice"
"announce her engagement to the family. With many compliments to them,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and much self-gratulation on the prospect of a connection between the","Pride and Prejudice"
"houses, he unfolded the matter,--to an audience not merely wondering,","Pride and Prejudice"
"but incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet, with more perseverance than","Pride and Prejudice"
"politeness, protested he must be entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always","Pride and Prejudice"
"unguarded and often uncivil, boisterously exclaimed,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not you know","Pride and Prejudice"
"that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne","Pride and Prejudice"
"without anger such treatment: but Sir William’s good-breeding carried","Pride and Prejudice"
"him through it all; and though he begged leave to be positive as to the","Pride and Prejudice"
"truth of his information, he listened to all their impertinence with the","Pride and Prejudice"
"most forbearing courtesy.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant","Pride and Prejudice"
"a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his account, by","Pride and Prejudice"
"mentioning her prior knowledge of it from Charlotte herself; and","Pride and Prejudice"
"endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters,","Pride and Prejudice"
"by the earnestness of her congratulations to Sir William, in which she","Pride and Prejudice"
"was readily joined by Jane, and by making a variety of remarks on the","Pride and Prejudice"
"happiness that might be expected from the match, the excellent character","Pride and Prejudice"
"of Mr. Collins, and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mrs. Bennet was, in fact, too much overpowered to say a great deal while","Pride and Prejudice"
"Sir William remained; but no sooner had he left them than her feelings","Pride and Prejudice"
"found a rapid vent. In the first place, she persisted in disbelieving","Pride and Prejudice"
"the whole of the matter; secondly, she was very sure that Mr. Collins","Pride and Prejudice"
"had been taken in; thirdly, she trusted that they would never be happy","Pride and Prejudice"
"together; and, fourthly, that the match might be broken off. Two","Pride and Prejudice"
"inferences, however, were plainly deduced from the whole: one, that","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth was the real cause of all the mischief; and the other, that","Pride and Prejudice"
"she herself had been barbarously used by them all; and on these two","Pride and Prejudice"
"points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could","Pride and Prejudice"
"console and nothing appease her. Nor did that day wear out her","Pride and Prejudice"
"resentment. A week elapsed before she could see Elizabeth without","Pride and Prejudice"
"scolding her: a month passed away before she could speak to Sir William","Pride and Prejudice"
"or Lady Lucas without being rude; and many months were gone before she","Pride and Prejudice"
"could at all forgive their daughter.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Bennet’s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion, and such","Pride and Prejudice"
"as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort; for","Pride and Prejudice"
"it gratified him, he said, to discover that Charlotte Lucas, whom he had","Pride and Prejudice"
"been used to think tolerably sensible, was as foolish as his wife, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"more foolish than his daughter!","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match: but she said","Pride and Prejudice"
"less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness;","Pride and Prejudice"
"nor could Elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable. Kitty and","Pride and Prejudice"
"Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas, for Mr. Collins was only a","Pride and Prejudice"
"clergyman; and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news","Pride and Prejudice"
"to spread at Meryton.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married; and she","Pride and Prejudice"
"called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was,","Pride and Prejudice"
"though Mrs. Bennet’s sour looks and ill-natured remarks might have been","Pride and Prejudice"
"enough to drive happiness away.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept them","Pride and Prejudice"
"mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded that no","Pride and Prejudice"
"real confidence could ever subsist between them again. Her","Pride and Prejudice"
"disappointment in Charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her","Pride and Prejudice"
"sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could","Pride and Prejudice"
"never be shaken, and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious, as","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bingley had now been gone a week, and nothing was heard of his return.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her letter, and was counting","Pride and Prejudice"
"the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again. The promised","Pride and Prejudice"
"letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on Tuesday, addressed to their","Pride and Prejudice"
"father, and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a","Pride and Prejudice"
"twelve-month’s abode in the family might have prompted. After","Pride and Prejudice"
"discharging his conscience on that head, he proceeded to inform them,","Pride and Prejudice"
"with many rapturous expressions, of his happiness in having obtained the","Pride and Prejudice"
"affection of their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained","Pride and Prejudice"
"that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had","Pride and Prejudice"
"been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at","Pride and Prejudice"
"Longbourn, whither he hoped to be able to return on Monday fortnight;","Pride and Prejudice"
"for Lady Catherine, he added, so heartily approved his marriage, that","Pride and Prejudice"
"she wished it to take place as soon as possible, which he trusted would","Pride and Prejudice"
"be an unanswerable argument with his amiable Charlotte to name an early","Pride and Prejudice"
"day for making him the happiest of men.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Collins’s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of","Pride and Prejudice"
"pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she was as much disposed to","Pride and Prejudice"
"complain of it as her husband. It was very strange that he should come","Pride and Prejudice"
"to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it was also very inconvenient","Pride and Prejudice"
"and exceedingly troublesome. She hated having visitors in the house","Pride and Prejudice"
"while her health was so indifferent, and lovers were of all people the","Pride and Prejudice"
"most disagreeable. Such were the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they","Pride and Prejudice"
"gave way only to the greater distress of Mr. Bingley’s continued","Pride and Prejudice"
"absence.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day after","Pride and Prejudice"
"day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the","Pride and Prejudice"
"report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his coming no more to","Pride and Prejudice"
"Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly incensed Mrs.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bennet, and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous","Pride and Prejudice"
"falsehood.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Even Elizabeth began to fear--not that Bingley was indifferent--but that","Pride and Prejudice"
"his sisters would be successful in keeping him away. Unwilling as she","Pride and Prejudice"
"was to admit an idea so destructive to Jane’s happiness, and so","Pride and Prejudice"
"dishonourable to the stability of her lover, she could not prevent its","Pride and Prejudice"
"frequently recurring. The united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and of his overpowering friend, assisted by the attractions of Miss","Pride and Prejudice"
"Darcy and the amusements of London, might be too much, she feared, for","Pride and Prejudice"
"the strength of his attachment.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"As for Jane, _her_ anxiety under this suspense was, of course, more","Pride and Prejudice"
"painful than Elizabeth’s: but whatever she felt she was desirous of","Pride and Prejudice"
"concealing; and between herself and Elizabeth, therefore, the subject","Pride and Prejudice"
"was never alluded to. But as no such delicacy restrained her mother, an","Pride and Prejudice"
"hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of Bingley, express her","Pride and Prejudice"
"impatience for his arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he","Pride and Prejudice"
"did not come back she should think herself very ill-used. It needed all","Pride and Prejudice"
"Jane’s steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable","Pride and Prejudice"
"tranquillity.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Collins returned most punctually on the Monday fortnight, but his","Pride and Prejudice"
"reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his","Pride and Prejudice"
"first introduction. He was too happy, however, to need much attention;","Pride and Prejudice"
"and, luckily for the others, the business of love-making relieved them","Pride and Prejudice"
"from a great deal of his company. The chief of every day was spent by","Pride and Prejudice"
"him at Lucas Lodge, and he sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time","Pride and Prejudice"
"to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed.","Pride and Prejudice"

"Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention of","Pride and Prejudice"
"anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of ill-humour, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of. The sight of","Pride and Prejudice"
"Miss Lucas was odious to her. As her successor in that house, she","Pride and Prejudice"

"them, she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession; and","Pride and Prejudice"
"whenever she spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that","Pride and Prejudice"
"they were talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself","Pride and Prejudice"
"and her daughters out of the house as soon as Mr. Bennet was dead. She","Pride and Prejudice"
"complained bitterly of all this to her husband.","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Miss Bingley’s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very first","Pride and Prejudice"
"sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in London for","Pride and Prejudice"
"the winter, and concluded with her brother’s regret at not having had","Pride and Prejudice"
"time to pay his respects to his friends in Hertfordshire before he left","Pride and Prejudice"
"the country.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the rest of","Pride and Prejudice"
"the letter, she found little, except the professed affection of the","Pride and Prejudice"
"writer, that could give her any comfort. Miss Darcy’s praise occupied","Pride and Prejudice"
"the chief of it. Her many attractions were again dwelt on; and Caroline","Pride and Prejudice"
"boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict","Pride and Prejudice"
"the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former","Pride and Prejudice"
"letter. She wrote also with great pleasure of her brother’s being an","Pride and Prejudice"
"inmate of Mr. Darcy’s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of","Pride and Prejudice"
"the latter with regard to new furniture.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this,","Pride and Prejudice"
"heard it in silent indignation. Her heart was divided between concern","Pride and Prejudice"
"for her sister and resentment against all others. To Caroline’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"assertion of her brother’s being partial to Miss Darcy, she paid no","Pride and Prejudice"
"credit. That he was really fond of Jane, she doubted no more than she","Pride and Prejudice"
"had ever done; and much as she had always been disposed to like him, she","Pride and Prejudice"
"could not think without anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness","Pride and Prejudice"
"of temper, that want of proper resolution, which now made him the slave","Pride and Prejudice"
"of his designing friends, and led him to sacrifice his own happiness to","Pride and Prejudice"
"the caprice of their inclinations. Had his own happiness, however, been","Pride and Prejudice"
"the only sacrifice, he might have been allowed to sport with it in","Pride and Prejudice"
"whatever manner he thought best; but her sister’s was involved in it, as","Pride and Prejudice"
"she thought he must be sensible himself. It was a subject, in short, on","Pride and Prejudice"
"which reflection would be long indulged, and must be unavailing. She","Pride and Prejudice"
"could think of nothing else; and yet, whether Bingley’s regard had","Pride and Prejudice"
"really died away, or were suppressed by his friends’ interference;","Pride and Prejudice"
"whether he had been aware of Jane’s attachment, or whether it had","Pride and Prejudice"
"escaped his observation; whichever were the case, though her opinion of","Pride and Prejudice"
"him must be materially affected by the difference, her sister’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"situation remained the same, her peace equally wounded.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet’s leaving them together, after a","Pride and Prejudice"
"longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could","Pride and Prejudice"
"not help saying,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“O that my dear mother had more command over herself! she can have no","Pride and Prejudice"
"idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him. But I","Pride and Prejudice"
"will not repine. It cannot last long. He will be forgot, and we shall","Pride and Prejudice"
"all be as we were before.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said","Pride and Prejudice"
"nothing.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You doubt me,” cried Jane, slightly colouring; “indeed, you have no","Pride and Prejudice"
"reason. He may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my","Pride and Prejudice"
"acquaintance but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or fear, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"nothing to reproach him with. Thank God I have not _that_ pain. A little","Pride and Prejudice"
"time, therefore--I shall certainly try to get the better----”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"With a stronger voice she soon added, “I have this comfort immediately,","Pride and Prejudice"
"that it has not been more than an error of fancy on my side, and that it","Pride and Prejudice"
"has done no harm to anyone but myself.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“My dear Jane,” exclaimed Elizabeth, “you are too good. Your sweetness","Pride and Prejudice"
"and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know what to say to","Pride and Prejudice"
"you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or loved you as you","Pride and Prejudice"
"deserve.”","Pride and Prejudice"

"Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw back","Pride and Prejudice"
"the praise on her sister’s warm affection.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Nay,” said Elizabeth, “this is not fair. _You_ wish to think all the","Pride and Prejudice"
"world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody. _I_ only want","Pride and Prejudice"
"to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself against it. Do not be","Pride and Prejudice"
"afraid of my running into any excess, of my encroaching on your","Pride and Prejudice"
"privilege of universal good-will. You need not. There are few people","Pride and Prejudice"
"whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I think well. The more I see","Pride and Prejudice"
"of the world the more am I dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms","Pride and Prejudice"
"my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters, and of the","Pride and Prejudice"
"little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of either merit","Pride and Prejudice"
"or sense. I have met with two instances lately: one I will not mention,","Pride and Prejudice"
"the other is Charlotte’s marriage. It is unaccountable! in every view it","Pride and Prejudice"
"is unaccountable!”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They will","Pride and Prejudice"
"ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for difference of","Pride and Prejudice"
"situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins’s respectability, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"Charlotte’s prudent, steady character. Remember that she is one of a","Pride and Prejudice"
"large family; that as to fortune it is a most eligible match; and be","Pride and Prejudice"
"ready to believe, for everybody’s sake, that she may feel something like","Pride and Prejudice"
"regard and esteem for our cousin.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no one else","Pride and Prejudice"
"could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I persuaded that","Pride and Prejudice"
"Charlotte had any regard for him, I should only think worse of her","Pride and Prejudice"
"understanding than I now do of her heart. My dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a","Pride and Prejudice"
"conceited, pompous, narrow-minded, silly man: you know he is, as well as","Pride and Prejudice"
"I do; and you must feel, as well as I do, that the woman who marries him","Pride and Prejudice"
"cannot have a proper way of thinking. You shall not defend her, though","Pride and Prejudice"
"it is Charlotte Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual,","Pride and Prejudice"
"change the meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade","Pride and Prejudice"
"yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility of","Pride and Prejudice"
"danger security for happiness.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,” replied","Pride and Prejudice"
"Jane; “and I hope you will be convinced of it, by seeing them happy","Pride and Prejudice"
"together. But enough of this. You alluded to something else. You","Pride and Prejudice"
"mentioned _two_ instances. I cannot misunderstand you, but I entreat","Pride and Prejudice"
"you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that person_ to blame, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"saying your opinion of him is sunk. We must not be so ready to fancy","Pride and Prejudice"
"ourselves intentionally injured. We must not expect a lively young man","Pride and Prejudice"
"to be always so guarded and circumspect. It is very often nothing but","Pride and Prejudice"
"our own vanity that deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than","Pride and Prejudice"
"it does.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“And men take care that they should.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have no idea","Pride and Prejudice"
"of there being so much design in the world as some persons imagine.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley’s conduct to design,”","Pride and Prejudice"
"said Elizabeth; “but, without scheming to do wrong, or to make others","Pride and Prejudice"
"unhappy, there may be error and there may be misery. Thoughtlessness,","Pride and Prejudice"
"want of attention to other people’s feelings, and want of resolution,","Pride and Prejudice"
"will do the business.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“And do you impute it to either of those?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yes; to the last. But if I go on I shall displease you by saying what I","Pride and Prejudice"
"think of persons you esteem. Stop me, whilst you can.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You persist, then, in supposing his sisters influence him?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yes, in conjunction with his friend.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him? They can","Pride and Prejudice"
"only wish his happiness; and if he is attached to me no other woman can","Pride and Prejudice"
"secure it.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides his","Pride and Prejudice"
"happiness: they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence; they","Pride and Prejudice"
"may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money, great","Pride and Prejudice"
"connections, and pride.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Beyond a doubt they do wish him to choose Miss Darcy,” replied Jane;","Pride and Prejudice"
"“but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing. They have","Pride and Prejudice"
"known her much longer than they have known me; no wonder if they love","Pride and Prejudice"
"her better. But, whatever may be their own wishes, it is very unlikely","Pride and Prejudice"
"they should have opposed their brother’s. What sister would think","Pride and Prejudice"
"herself at liberty to do it, unless there were something very","Pride and Prejudice"
"objectionable? If they believed him attached to me they would not try to","Pride and Prejudice"
"part us; if he were so, they could not succeed. By supposing such an","Pride and Prejudice"
"affection, you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most","Pride and Prejudice"
"unhappy. Do not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been","Pride and Prejudice"
"mistaken--or, at least, it is slight, it is nothing in comparison of","Pride and Prejudice"
"what I should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters. Let me take it","Pride and Prejudice"
"in the best light, in the light in which it may be understood.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no","Pride and Prejudice"
"more; and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account","Pride and Prejudice"
"for it clearly, there seemed little chance of her ever considering it","Pride and Prejudice"
"with less perplexity. Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what","Pride and Prejudice"

"the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw","Pride and Prejudice"

"comfort was, that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. “So, Lizzy,” said he, one","Pride and Prejudice"
"day, “your sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate her. Next","Pride and Prejudice"
"to being married, a girl likes to be crossed in love a little now and","Pride and Prejudice"
"then. It is something to think of, and gives her a sort of distinction","Pride and Prejudice"
"among her companions. When is your turn to come? You will hardly bear to","Pride and Prejudice"
"be long outdone by Jane. Now is your time. Here are officers enough at","Pride and Prejudice"
"Meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham","Pride and Prejudice"
"be your man. He is a pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not","Pride and Prejudice"

"in it.","Pride and Prejudice"

"that she might have been Mr. Collins’s wife by this time, had not it","Pride and Prejudice"
"been for her own perverseness. He made her an offer in this very room,","Pride and Prejudice"

"The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the Philipses,","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mrs. Gardiner’s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on","Pride and Prejudice"
"the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone: after","Pride and Prejudice"
"honestly telling her what she thought, she thus went on:--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely because you","Pride and Prejudice"
"are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not afraid of speaking","Pride and Prejudice"
"openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your guard. Do not involve","Pride and Prejudice"
"yourself, or endeavour to involve him, in an affection which the want of","Pride and Prejudice"
"fortune would make so very imprudent. I have nothing to say against","Pride and Prejudice"
"_him_: he is a most interesting young man; and if he had the fortune he","Pride and Prejudice"
"ought to have, I should think you could not do better. But as it is--you","Pride and Prejudice"
"must not let your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all","Pride and Prejudice"
"expect you to use it. Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and","Pride and Prejudice"
"good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of","Pride and Prejudice"
"myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He shall not be in love with me, if I","Pride and Prejudice"
"can prevent it.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Elizabeth, you are not serious now.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I beg your pardon. I will try again. At present I am not in love with","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he is, beyond all comparison,","Pride and Prejudice"
"the most agreeable man I ever saw--and if he becomes really attached to","Pride and Prejudice"
"me--I believe it will be better that he should not. I see the imprudence","Pride and Prejudice"
"of it. Oh, _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy! My father’s opinion of me does","Pride and Prejudice"
"me the greatest honour; and I should be miserable to forfeit it. My","Pride and Prejudice"
"father, however, is partial to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I","Pride and Prejudice"
"should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy; but","Pride and Prejudice"
"since we see, every day, that where there is affection young people are","Pride and Prejudice"
"seldom withheld, by immediate want of fortune, from entering into","Pride and Prejudice"
"engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than so many","Pride and Prejudice"
"of my fellow-creatures, if I am tempted, or how am I even to know that","Pride and Prejudice"
"it would be wiser to resist? All that I can promise you, therefore, is","Pride and Prejudice"
"not to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry to believe myself his","Pride and Prejudice"
"first object. When I am in company with him, I will not be wishing. In","Pride and Prejudice"
"short, I will do my best.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his coming here so very","Pride and Prejudice"
"often. At least you should not _remind_ your mother of inviting him.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“As I did the other day,” said Elizabeth, with a conscious smile; “very","Pride and Prejudice"
"true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_. But do not imagine","Pride and Prejudice"
"that he is always here so often. It is on your account that he has been","Pride and Prejudice"
"so frequently invited this week. You know my mother’s ideas as to the","Pride and Prejudice"
"necessity of constant company for her friends. But really, and upon my","Pride and Prejudice"
"honour, I will try to do what I think to be wisest; and now I hope you","Pride and Prejudice"
"are satisfied.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Her aunt assured her that she was; and Elizabeth, having thanked her for","Pride and Prejudice"
"the kindness of her hints, they parted,--a wonderful instance of advice","Pride and Prejudice"
"being given on such a point without being resented.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted","Pride and Prejudice"
"by the Gardiners and Jane; but, as he took up his abode with the","Pride and Prejudice"
"Lucases, his arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs. Bennet. His","Pride and Prejudice"
"marriage was now fast approaching; and she was at length so far resigned","Pride and Prejudice"
"as to think it inevitable, and even repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured","Pride and Prejudice"
"tone, that she “_wished_ they might be happy.” Thursday was to be the","Pride and Prejudice"
"wedding-day, and on Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her farewell visit; and","Pride and Prejudice"
"when she rose to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her mother’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"ungracious and reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself,","Pride and Prejudice"
"accompanied her out of the room. As they went down stairs together,","Pride and Prejudice"
"Charlotte said,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“_That_ you certainly shall.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“And I have another favour to ask. Will you come and see me?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me, therefore, to","Pride and Prejudice"
"come to Hunsford.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth could not refuse, though she foresaw little pleasure in the","Pride and Prejudice"
"visit.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“My father and Maria are to come to me in March,” added Charlotte, “and","Pride and Prejudice"
"I hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza, you will be","Pride and Prejudice"
"as welcome to me as either of them.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The wedding took place: the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent from","Pride and Prejudice"
"the church door, and everybody had as much to say or to hear on the","Pride and Prejudice"
"subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her friend, and their","Pride and Prejudice"
"correspondence was as regular and frequent as it ever had been: that it","Pride and Prejudice"
"should be equally unreserved was impossible. Elizabeth could never","Pride and Prejudice"
"address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over;","Pride and Prejudice"
"and, though determined not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the","Pride and Prejudice"
"sake of what had been rather than what was. Charlotte’s first letters","Pride and Prejudice"
"were received with a good deal of eagerness: there could not but be","Pride and Prejudice"
"curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home, how she would","Pride and Prejudice"
"like Lady Catherine, and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to","Pride and Prejudice"
"be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt that Charlotte","Pride and Prejudice"
"expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen. She","Pride and Prejudice"
"wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with comforts, and mentioned nothing","Pride and Prejudice"
"which she could not praise. The house, furniture, neighbourhood, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"roads, were all to her taste, and Lady Catherine’s behaviour was most","Pride and Prejudice"
"friendly and obliging. It was Mr. Collins’s picture of Hunsford and","Pride and Prejudice"
"Rosings rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she must wait","Pride and Prejudice"
"for her own visit there, to know the rest.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Jane had already written a few lines to her sister, to announce their","Pride and Prejudice"
"safe arrival in London; and when she wrote again, Elizabeth hoped it","Pride and Prejudice"
"would be in her power to say something of the Bingleys.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience","Pride and Prejudice"
"generally is. Jane had been a week in town, without either seeing or","Pride and Prejudice"
"hearing from Caroline. She accounted for it, however, by supposing that","Pride and Prejudice"
"her last letter to her friend from Longbourn had by some accident been","Pride and Prejudice"
"lost.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“My aunt,” she continued, “is going to-morrow into that part of the","Pride and Prejudice"
"town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in Grosvenor Street.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She wrote again when the visit was paid, and she had seen Miss Bingley.","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I did not think Caroline in spirits,” were her words, “but she was very","Pride and Prejudice"
"glad to see me, and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming","Pride and Prejudice"
"to London. I was right, therefore; my last letter had never reached her.","Pride and Prejudice"
"I inquired after their brother, of course. He was well, but so much","Pride and Prejudice"
"engaged with Mr. Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him. I found that","Pride and Prejudice"
"Miss Darcy was expected to dinner: I wish I could see her. My visit was","Pride and Prejudice"
"not long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I shall","Pride and Prejudice"
"soon see them here.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth shook her head over this letter. It convinced her that","Pride and Prejudice"
"accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her sister’s being in town.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him. She endeavoured to","Pride and Prejudice"
"persuade herself that she did not regret it; but she could no longer be","Pride and Prejudice"
"blind to Miss Bingley’s inattention. After waiting at home every morning","Pride and Prejudice"
"for a fortnight, and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her, the","Pride and Prejudice"
"visitor did at last appear; but the shortness of her stay, and, yet","Pride and Prejudice"
"more, the alteration of her manner, would allow Jane to deceive herself","Pride and Prejudice"
"no longer. The letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister","Pride and Prejudice"
"will prove what she felt:--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"     “My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in","Pride and Prejudice"
"     her better judgment, at my expense, when I confess myself to have","Pride and Prejudice"
"     been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley’s regard for me. But, my","Pride and Prejudice"
"     dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not think me","Pride and Prejudice"
"     obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her behaviour","Pride and Prejudice"
"     was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. I do not at","Pride and Prejudice"
"     all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me; but,","Pride and Prejudice"
"     if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am sure I should","Pride and Prejudice"
"     be deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit till yesterday;","Pride and Prejudice"
"     and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the meantime. When she","Pride and Prejudice"
"     did come, it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it; she","Pride and Prejudice"
"     made a slight, formal apology for not calling before, said not a","Pride and Prejudice"
"     word of wishing to see me again, and was, in every respect, so","Pride and Prejudice"
"     altered a creature, that when she went away I was perfectly","Pride and Prejudice"
"     resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer. I pity, though I","Pride and Prejudice"
"     cannot help blaming, her. She was very wrong in singling me out as","Pride and Prejudice"
"     she did; I can safely say, that every advance to intimacy began on","Pride and Prejudice"
"     her side. But I pity her, because she must feel that she has been","Pride and Prejudice"
"     acting wrong, and because I am very sure that anxiety for her","Pride and Prejudice"
"     brother is the cause of it. I need not explain myself farther; and","Pride and Prejudice"
"     though _we_ know this anxiety to be quite needless, yet if she","Pride and Prejudice"
"     feels it, it will easily account for her behaviour to me; and so","Pride and Prejudice"
"     deservedly dear as he is to his sister, whatever anxiety she may","Pride and Prejudice"
"     feel on his behalf is natural and amiable. I cannot but wonder,","Pride and Prejudice"
"     however, at her having any such fears now, because if he had at all","Pride and Prejudice"
"     cared about me, we must have met long, long ago. He knows of my","Pride and Prejudice"
"     being in town, I am certain, from something she said herself; and","Pride and Prejudice"
"     yet it would seem, by her manner of talking, as if she wanted to","Pride and Prejudice"
"     persuade herself that he is really partial to Miss Darcy. I cannot","Pride and Prejudice"
"     understand it. If I were not afraid of judging harshly, I should be","Pride and Prejudice"
"     almost tempted to say, that there is a strong appearance of","Pride and Prejudice"
"     duplicity in all this. I will endeavour to banish every painful","Pride and Prejudice"
"     thought, and think only of what will make me happy, your affection,","Pride and Prejudice"
"     and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear","Pride and Prejudice"
"     from you very soon. Miss Bingley said something of his never","Pride and Prejudice"
"     returning to Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not","Pride and Prejudice"
"     with any certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely","Pride and Prejudice"
"     glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at","Pride and Prejudice"
"     Hunsford. Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria. I am","Pride and Prejudice"
"     sure you will be very comfortable there.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yours, etc.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her spirits returned, as she","Pride and Prejudice"
"considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister at least.","Pride and Prejudice"
"All expectation from the brother was now absolutely over. She would not","Pride and Prejudice"
"even wish for any renewal of his attentions. His character sunk on every","Pride and Prejudice"
"review of it; and, as a punishment for him, as well as a possible","Pride and Prejudice"
"advantage to Jane, she seriously hoped he might really soon marry Mr.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Darcy’s sister, as, by Wickham’s account, she would make him abundantly","Pride and Prejudice"
"regret what he had thrown away.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her promise","Pride and Prejudice"
"concerning that gentleman, and required information; and Elizabeth had","Pride and Prejudice"
"such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to","Pride and Prejudice"
"herself. His apparent partiality had subsided, his attentions were over,","Pride and Prejudice"
"he was the admirer of some one else. Elizabeth was watchful enough to","Pride and Prejudice"
"see it all, but she could see it and write of it without material pain.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Her heart had been but slightly touched, and her vanity was satisfied","Pride and Prejudice"
"with believing that _she_ would have been his only choice, had fortune","Pride and Prejudice"
"permitted it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most","Pride and Prejudice"
"remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself","Pride and Prejudice"
"agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in this case than","Pride and Prejudice"
"in Charlotte’s, did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Nothing, on the contrary, could be more natural; and, while able to","Pride and Prejudice"
"suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her, she was","Pride and Prejudice"
"ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both, and could very","Pride and Prejudice"
"sincerely wish him happy.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and, after relating the","Pride and Prejudice"
"circumstances, she thus went on:--“I am now convinced, my dear aunt,","Pride and Prejudice"
"that I have never been much in love; for had I really experienced that","Pride and Prejudice"
"pure and elevating passion, I should at present detest his very name,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and wish him all manner of evil. But my feelings are not only cordial","Pride and Prejudice"
"towards _him_, they are even impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find","Pride and Prejudice"
"out that I hate her at all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think","Pride and Prejudice"
"her a very good sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My","Pride and Prejudice"
"watchfulness has been effectual; and though I should certainly be a more","Pride and Prejudice"
"interesting object to all my acquaintance, were I distractedly in love","Pride and Prejudice"
"with him, I cannot say that I regret my comparative insignificance.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly. Kitty and Lydia take","Pride and Prejudice"
"his defection much more to heart than I do. They are young in the ways","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise","Pride and Prejudice"
"diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and","Pride and Prejudice"
"sometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of","Pride and Prejudice"
"going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the","Pride and Prejudice"
"plan, and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater","Pride and Prejudice"
"pleasure as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire","Pride and Prejudice"
"of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins.","Pride and Prejudice"
"There was novelty in the scheme; and as, with such a mother and such","Pride and Prejudice"
"uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change","Pride and Prejudice"
"was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would, moreover, give","Pride and Prejudice"
"her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have","Pride and Prejudice"
"been very sorry for any delay. Everything, however, went on smoothly,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and was finally settled according to Charlotte’s first sketch. She was","Pride and Prejudice"
"to accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement of","Pride and Prejudice"
"spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became as","Pride and Prejudice"
"perfect as plan could be.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going, that he","Pride and Prejudice"
"told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on","Pride and Prejudice"
"his side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the","Pride and Prejudice"
"first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner","Pride and Prejudice"
"of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what","Pride and Prejudice"
"she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their","Pride and Prejudice"
"opinion of her--their opinion of everybody--would always coincide, there","Pride and Prejudice"
"was a solicitude, an interest, which she felt must ever attach her to","Pride and Prejudice"
"him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced, that,","Pride and Prejudice"
"whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable","Pride and Prejudice"
"and pleasing.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think","Pride and Prejudice"
"him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his daughter Maria, a","Pride and Prejudice"
"good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say","Pride and Prejudice"
"that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much","Pride and Prejudice"
"delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but","Pride and Prejudice"
"she had known Sir William’s too long. He could tell her nothing new of","Pride and Prejudice"
"the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were","Pride and Prejudice"
"worn out, like his information.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early","Pride and Prejudice"
"as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival: when","Pride and Prejudice"
"they entered the passage, she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth,","Pride and Prejudice"
"looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and","Pride and Prejudice"
"lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls,","Pride and Prejudice"
"whose eagerness for their cousin’s appearance would not allow them to","Pride and Prejudice"
"wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her","Pride and Prejudice"
"for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and","Pride and Prejudice"
"kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and","Pride and Prejudice"
"shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first subject was her","Pride and Prejudice"
"sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to","Pride and Prejudice"
"her minute inquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her","Pride and Prejudice"
"spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however, to","Pride and Prejudice"
"hope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the","Pride and Prejudice"
"particulars also of Miss Bingley’s visit in Gracechurch Street, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and","Pride and Prejudice"
"herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the","Pride and Prejudice"
"acquaintance.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her niece on Wickham’s desertion, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"complimented her on bearing it so well.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“But, my dear Elizabeth,” she added, “what sort of girl is Miss King? I","Pride and Prejudice"
"should be sorry to think our friend mercenary.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial affairs,","Pride and Prejudice"
"between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does discretion end,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid of his marrying me,","Pride and Prejudice"
"because it would be imprudent; and now, because he is trying to get a","Pride and Prejudice"
"girl with only ten thousand pounds, you want to find out that he is","Pride and Prejudice"
"mercenary.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall know","Pride and Prejudice"
"what to think.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“She is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of her.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“But he paid her not the smallest attention till her grandfather’s death","Pride and Prejudice"
"made her mistress of this fortune?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“No--why should he? If it were not allowable for him to gain _my_","Pride and Prejudice"
"affections, because I had no money, what occasion could there be for","Pride and Prejudice"
"making love to a girl whom he did not care about, and who was equally","Pride and Prejudice"
"poor?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“But there seems indelicacy in directing his attentions towards her so","Pride and Prejudice"
"soon after this event.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those elegant","Pride and Prejudice"
"decorums which other people may observe. If _she_ does not object to it,","Pride and Prejudice"
"why should _we_?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“_Her_ not objecting does not justify _him_. It only shows her being","Pride and Prejudice"
"deficient in something herself--sense or feeling.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Well,” cried Elizabeth, “have it as you choose. _He_ shall be","Pride and Prejudice"
"mercenary, and _she_ shall be foolish.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose. I should be sorry, you know,","Pride and Prejudice"
"to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in Derbyshire.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Oh, if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who live in","Pride and Prejudice"
"Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in Hertfordshire are not","Pride and Prejudice"
"much better. I am sick of them all. Thank heaven! I am going to-morrow","Pride and Prejudice"
"where I shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality, who has","Pride and Prejudice"
"neither manners nor sense to recommend him. Stupid men are the only ones","Pride and Prejudice"
"worth knowing, after all.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of disappointment.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she had the","Pride and Prejudice"
"unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in","Pride and Prejudice"
"a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“We have not quite determined how far it shall carry us,” said Mrs.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Gardiner; “but perhaps, to the Lakes.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her","Pride and Prejudice"
"acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. “My dear, dear","Pride and Prejudice"
"aunt,” she rapturously cried, “what delight! what felicity! You give me","Pride and Prejudice"
"fresh life and vigour. Adieu to disappointment and spleen. What are men","Pride and Prejudice"
"to rocks and mountains? Oh, what hours of transport we shall spend! And","Pride and Prejudice"
"when we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without","Pride and Prejudice"
"being able to give one accurate idea of anything. We _will_ know where","Pride and Prejudice"
"we have gone--we _will_ recollect what we have seen. Lakes, mountains,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and rivers, shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations; nor, when","Pride and Prejudice"
"we attempt to describe any particular scene, will we begin quarrelling","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"[Illustration]","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Every object in the next day’s journey was new and interesting to","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth; and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she had","Pride and Prejudice"
"seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye was in","Pride and Prejudice"
"search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to bring it in view.","Pride and Prejudice"
"The paling of Rosings park was their boundary on one side. Elizabeth","Pride and Prejudice"
"smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to the","Pride and Prejudice"
"road, the house standing in it, the green pales and the laurel hedge,","Pride and Prejudice"
"everything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins and Charlotte","Pride and Prejudice"
"appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at the small gate, which","Pride and Prejudice"
"led by a short gravel walk to the house, amidst the nods and smiles of","Pride and Prejudice"
"the whole party. In a moment they were all out of the chaise, rejoicing","Pride and Prejudice"
"at the sight of each other. Mrs. Collins welcomed her friend with the","Pride and Prejudice"
"liveliest pleasure, and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with","Pride and Prejudice"
"coming, when she found herself so affectionately received. She saw","Pride and Prejudice"
"instantly that her cousin’s manners were not altered by his marriage:","Pride and Prejudice"
"his formal civility was just what it had been; and he detained her some","Pride and Prejudice"
"minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his inquiries after all her","Pride and Prejudice"
"family. They were then, with no other delay than his pointing out the","Pride and Prejudice"
"neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as soon as they were","Pride and Prejudice"
"in the parlour, he welcomed them a second time, with ostentatious","Pride and Prejudice"
"formality, to his humble abode, and punctually repeated all his wife’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"offers of refreshment.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory; and she could not help","Pride and Prejudice"
"fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room, its aspect,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and its furniture, he addressed himself particularly to her, as if","Pride and Prejudice"
"wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him. But though","Pride and Prejudice"
"everything seemed neat and comfortable, she was not able to gratify him","Pride and Prejudice"
"by any sigh of repentance; and rather looked with wonder at her friend,","Pride and Prejudice"
"that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion. When Mr.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed,","Pride and Prejudice"
"which certainly was not seldom, she involuntarily turned her eye on","Pride and Prejudice"
"Charlotte. Once or twice she could discern a faint blush; but in general","Pride and Prejudice"
"Charlotte wisely did not hear. After sitting long enough to admire","Pride and Prejudice"
"every article of furniture in the room, from the sideboard to the","Pride and Prejudice"
"fender, to give an account of their journey, and of all that had","Pride and Prejudice"
"happened in London, Mr. Collins invited them to take a stroll in the","Pride and Prejudice"
"garden, which was large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of","Pride and Prejudice"
"which he attended himself. To work in his garden was one of his most","Pride and Prejudice"
"respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance","Pride and Prejudice"
"with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"owned she encouraged it as much as possible. Here, leading the way","Pride and Prejudice"
"through every walk and cross walk, and scarcely allowing them an","Pride and Prejudice"
"interval to utter the praises he asked for, every view was pointed out","Pride and Prejudice"
"with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind. He could number the","Pride and Prejudice"
"fields in every direction, and could tell how many trees there were in","Pride and Prejudice"
"the most distant clump. But of all the views which his garden, or which","Pride and Prejudice"
"the country or the kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with","Pride and Prejudice"
"the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that","Pride and Prejudice"
"bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house. It was a","Pride and Prejudice"
"handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"From his garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his two meadows;","Pride and Prejudice"
"but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white","Pride and Prejudice"
"frost, turned back; and while Sir William accompanied him, Charlotte","Pride and Prejudice"
"took her sister and friend over the house, extremely well pleased,","Pride and Prejudice"
"probably, to have the opportunity of showing it without her husband’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"help. It was rather small, but well built and convenient; and everything","Pride and Prejudice"
"was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency, of which","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be","Pride and Prejudice"
"forgotten, there was really a great air of comfort throughout, and by","Pride and Prejudice"
"Charlotte’s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he must be often","Pride and Prejudice"
"forgotten.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country. It","Pride and Prejudice"
"was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when Mr. Collins joining","Pride and Prejudice"
"in, observed,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady Catherine","Pride and Prejudice"
"de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need not say you will","Pride and Prejudice"
"be delighted with her. She is all affability and condescension, and I","Pride and Prejudice"
"doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when","Pride and Prejudice"
"service is over. I have scarcely any hesitation in saying that she will","Pride and Prejudice"
"include you and my sister Maria in every invitation with which she","Pride and Prejudice"
"honours us during your stay here. Her behaviour to my dear Charlotte is","Pride and Prejudice"
"charming. We dine at Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to","Pride and Prejudice"
"walk home. Her Ladyship’s carriage is regularly ordered for us. I","Pride and Prejudice"
"_should_ say, one of her Ladyship’s carriages, for she has several.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman, indeed,” added","Pride and Prejudice"
"Charlotte, “and a most attentive neighbour.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She is the sort of","Pride and Prejudice"
"woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"telling again what had been already written; and when it closed,","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth, in the solitude of her chamber, had to meditate upon","Pride and Prejudice"
"Charlotte’s degree of contentment, to understand her address in guiding,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and composure in bearing with, her husband, and to acknowledge that it","Pride and Prejudice"
"was all done very well. She had also to anticipate how her visit would","Pride and Prejudice"
"pass, the quiet tenour of their usual employments, the vexatious","Pride and Prejudice"
"interruptions of Mr. Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse","Pride and Prejudice"
"with Rosings. A lively imagination soon settled it all.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"About the middle of the next day, as she was in her room getting ready","Pride and Prejudice"
"for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in","Pride and Prejudice"
"confusion; and, after listening a moment, she heard somebody running","Pride and Prejudice"
"upstairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly after her. She opened","Pride and Prejudice"
"the door, and met Maria in the landing-place, who, breathless with","Pride and Prejudice"
"agitation, cried out,--","Pride and Prejudice"

"haste, and come down this moment.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her nothing more;","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“And is this all?” cried Elizabeth. “I expected at least that the pigs","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“La! my dear,” said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, “it is not Lady","Pride and Prejudice"
"Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives with them. The","Pride and Prejudice"

"“I like her appearance,” said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas. “She","Pride and Prejudice"

"The power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering","Pride and Prejudice"
"visitors, and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his","Pride and Prejudice"
"wife, was exactly what he had wished for; and that an opportunity of","Pride and Prejudice"
"doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of Lady","Pride and Prejudice"
"Catherine’s condescension as he knew not how to admire enough.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I confess,” said he, “that I should not have been at all surprised by","Pride and Prejudice"
"her Ladyship’s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and spend the evening","Pride and Prejudice"
"at Rosings. I rather expected, from my knowledge of her affability, that","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I am the less surprised at what has happened,” replied Sir William,","Pride and Prejudice"
"“from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are, which","Pride and Prejudice"
"my situation in life has allowed me to acquire. About the court, such","Pride and Prejudice"
"instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their","Pride and Prejudice"
"visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing them in what","Pride and Prejudice"
"they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms, so many servants, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"so splendid a dinner, might not wholly overpower them.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he said to","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel. Lady","Pride and Prejudice"
"Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which","Pride and Prejudice"
"becomes herself and daughter. I would advise you merely to put on","Pride and Prejudice"
"whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest--there is no occasion","Pride and Prejudice"
"for anything more. Lady Catherine will not think the worse of you for","Pride and Prejudice"
"being simply dressed. She likes to have the distinction of rank","Pride and Prejudice"
"preserved.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"While they were dressing, he came two or three times to their different","Pride and Prejudice"
"doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady Catherine very much","Pride and Prejudice"
"objected to be kept waiting for her dinner. Such formidable accounts of","Pride and Prejudice"
"her Ladyship, and her manner of living, quite frightened Maria Lucas,","Pride and Prejudice"
"who had been little used to company; and she looked forward to her","Pride and Prejudice"
"introduction at Rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done","Pride and Prejudice"
"to his presentation at St. James’s.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile","Pride and Prejudice"
"across the park. Every park has its beauty and its prospects; and","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she could not be in such","Pride and Prejudice"
"raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene to inspire, and was but","Pride and Prejudice"
"slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the","Pride and Prejudice"
"house, and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally","Pride and Prejudice"
"cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria’s alarm was every moment","Pride and Prejudice"
"increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly calm.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth’s courage did not fail her. She had heard nothing of Lady","Pride and Prejudice"
"Catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or","Pride and Prejudice"
"miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money and rank she","Pride and Prejudice"
"thought she could witness without trepidation.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"From the entrance hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a","Pride and Prejudice"
"rapturous air, the fine proportion and finished ornaments, they followed","Pride and Prejudice"
"the servants through an antechamber to the room where Lady Catherine,","Pride and Prejudice"
"her daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were sitting. Her Ladyship, with great","Pride and Prejudice"
"condescension, arose to receive them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it","Pride and Prejudice"
"with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers, it was","Pride and Prejudice"
"performed in a proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks","Pride and Prejudice"
"which he would have thought necessary.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"In spite of having been at St. James’s, Sir William was so completely","Pride and Prejudice"
"awed by the grandeur surrounding him, that he had but just courage","Pride and Prejudice"
"enough to make a very low bow, and take his seat without saying a word;","Pride and Prejudice"
"and his daughter, frightened almost out of her senses, sat on the edge","Pride and Prejudice"
"of her chair, not knowing which way to look. Elizabeth found herself","Pride and Prejudice"
"quite equal to the scene, and could observe the three ladies before her","Pride and Prejudice"
"composedly. Lady Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked","Pride and Prejudice"
"features, which might once have been handsome. Her air was not","Pride and Prejudice"
"conciliating, nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her","Pride and Prejudice"
"visitors forget their inferior rank. She was not rendered formidable by","Pride and Prejudice"
"silence: but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as","Pride and Prejudice"
"marked her self-importance, and brought Mr. Wickham immediately to","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth’s mind; and, from the observation of the day altogether, she","Pride and Prejudice"
"believed Lady Catherine to be exactly what he had represented.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and deportment","Pride and Prejudice"
"she soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she turned her eyes on the","Pride and Prejudice"
"daughter, she could almost have joined in Maria’s astonishment at her","Pride and Prejudice"
"being so thin and so small. There was neither in figure nor face any","Pride and Prejudice"
"likeness between the ladies. Miss de Bourgh was pale and sickly: her","Pride and Prejudice"
"features, though not plain, were insignificant; and she spoke very","Pride and Prejudice"
"little, except in a low voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance","Pride and Prejudice"
"there was nothing remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening","Pride and Prejudice"
"to what she said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before","Pride and Prejudice"
"her eyes.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the windows to","Pride and Prejudice"
"admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point out its beauties,","Pride and Prejudice"

"nothing greater. He carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity;","Pride and Prejudice"
"and every dish was commended first by him, and then by Sir William, who","Pride and Prejudice"
"was now enough recovered to echo whatever his son-in-law said, in a","Pride and Prejudice"
"manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But Lady","Pride and Prejudice"
"Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration, and gave most","Pride and Prejudice"
"gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty","Pride and Prejudice"
"to them. The party did not supply much conversation. Elizabeth was ready","Pride and Prejudice"
"to speak whenever there was an opening, but she was seated between","Pride and Prejudice"
"Charlotte and Miss de Bourgh--the former of whom was engaged in","Pride and Prejudice"
"listening to Lady Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her all","Pride and Prejudice"
"the dinnertime. Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how","Pride and Prejudice"
"little Miss de Bourgh ate, pressing her to try some other dish and","Pride and Prejudice"
"fearing she was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to be","Pride and Prejudice"
"done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she did without any","Pride and Prejudice"
"intermission till coffee came in, delivering her opinion on every","Pride and Prejudice"
"subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have","Pride and Prejudice"
"her judgment controverted. She inquired into Charlotte’s domestic","Pride and Prejudice"
"concerns familiarly and minutely, and gave her a great deal of advice as","Pride and Prejudice"
"to the management of them all; told her how everything ought to be","Pride and Prejudice"
"regulated in so small a family as hers, and instructed her as to the","Pride and Prejudice"
"care of her cows and her poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was","Pride and Prejudice"
"beneath this great lady’s attention which could furnish her with an","Pride and Prejudice"
"occasion for dictating to others. In the intervals of her discourse with","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mrs. Collins, she addressed a variety of questions to Maria and","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she knew","Pride and Prejudice"
"the least, and who, she observed to Mrs. Collins, was a very genteel,","Pride and Prejudice"
"pretty kind of girl. She asked her at different times how many sisters","Pride and Prejudice"
"she had, whether they were older or younger than herself, whether any of","Pride and Prejudice"
"them were likely to be married, whether they were handsome, where they","Pride and Prejudice"
"had been educated, what carriage her father kept, and what had been her","Pride and Prejudice"
"mother’s maiden name? Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her","Pride and Prejudice"
"questions, but answered them very composedly. Lady Catherine then","Pride and Prejudice"
"observed,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Your father’s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think? For your","Pride and Prejudice"
"sake,” turning to Charlotte, “I am glad of it; but otherwise I see no","Pride and Prejudice"
"occasion for entailing estates from the female line. It was not thought","Pride and Prejudice"
"necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh’s family. Do you play and sing, Miss","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bennet?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“A little.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Oh then--some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our","Pride and Prejudice"
"instrument is a capital one, probably superior to ---- you shall try it","Pride and Prejudice"
"some day. Do your sisters play and sing?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“One of them does.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The Miss","Pride and Prejudice"
"Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income as yours. Do","Pride and Prejudice"
"you draw?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“No, not at all.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“What, none of you?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Not one.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your mother","Pride and Prejudice"
"should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit of masters.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“My mother would have no objection, but my father hates London.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Has your governess left you?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“We never had any governess.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up at home","Pride and Prejudice"
"without a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your mother must","Pride and Prejudice"
"have been quite a slave to your education.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth could hardly help smiling, as she assured her that had not","Pride and Prejudice"
"been the case.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Then who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess, you must","Pride and Prejudice"
"have been neglected.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us as","Pride and Prejudice"
"wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always encouraged to","Pride and Prejudice"
"read, and had all the masters that were necessary. Those who chose to be","Pride and Prejudice"
"idle certainly might.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Ay, no doubt: but that is what a governess will prevent; and if I had","Pride and Prejudice"
"known your mother, I should have advised her most strenuously to engage","Pride and Prejudice"
"one. I always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady","Pride and Prejudice"
"and regular instruction, and nobody but a governess can give it. It is","Pride and Prejudice"
"wonderful how many families I have been the means of supplying in that","Pride and Prejudice"
"way. I am always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces","Pride and Prejudice"
"of Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means; and","Pride and Prejudice"
"it was but the other day that I recommended another young person, who","Pride and Prejudice"
"was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the family are quite","Pride and Prejudice"
"delighted with her. Mrs. Collins, did I tell you of Lady Metcalfe’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"calling yesterday to thank me? She finds Miss Pope a treasure. ‘Lady","Pride and Prejudice"
"Catherine,’ said she, ‘you have given me a treasure.’ Are any of your","Pride and Prejudice"
"younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yes, ma’am, all.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the second. The","Pride and Prejudice"
"younger ones out before the elder are married! Your younger sisters must","Pride and Prejudice"
"be very young?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she_ is full young to be much","Pride and Prejudice"
"in company. But really, ma’am, I think it would be very hard upon","Pride and Prejudice"
"younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and","Pride and Prejudice"
"amusement, because the elder may not have the means or inclination to","Pride and Prejudice"
"marry early. The last born has as good a right to the pleasures of youth","Pride and Prejudice"
"as the first. And to be kept back on _such_ a motive! I think it would","Pride and Prejudice"
"not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Upon my word,” said her Ladyship, “you give your opinion very decidedly","Pride and Prejudice"
"for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“With three younger sisters grown up,” replied Elizabeth, smiling, “your","Pride and Prejudice"
"Ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct answer;","Pride and Prejudice"
"and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature who had ever","Pride and Prejudice"
"dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure,--therefore you need not","Pride and Prejudice"
"conceal your age.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I am not one-and-twenty.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the card tables","Pride and Prejudice"
"were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and Mrs. Collins sat","Pride and Prejudice"
"down to quadrille; and as Miss De Bourgh chose to play at cassino, the","Pride and Prejudice"
"two girls had the honour of assisting Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her","Pride and Prejudice"
"party. Their table was superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was","Pride and Prejudice"
"uttered that did not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson","Pride and Prejudice"
"expressed her fears of Miss De Bourgh’s being too hot or too cold, or","Pride and Prejudice"
"having too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the","Pride and Prejudice"
"other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking--stating the mistakes","Pride and Prejudice"
"of the three others, or relating some anecdote of herself. Mr. Collins","Pride and Prejudice"
"was employed in agreeing to everything her Ladyship said, thanking her","Pride and Prejudice"
"for every fish he won, and apologizing if he thought he won too many.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Sir William did not say much. He was storing his memory with anecdotes","Pride and Prejudice"
"and noble names.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"When Lady Catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose,","Pride and Prejudice"
"the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to Mrs. Collins,","Pride and Prejudice"
"gratefully accepted, and immediately ordered. The party then gathered","Pride and Prejudice"
"round the fire to hear Lady Catherine determine what weather they were","Pride and Prejudice"
"to have on the morrow. From these instructions they were summoned by the","Pride and Prejudice"

"for Charlotte’s sake, she made more favourable than it really was. But","Pride and Prejudice"

"Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford; but his visit was long","Pride and Prejudice"
"enough to convince him of his daughter’s being most comfortably settled,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not","Pride and Prejudice"
"often met with. While Sir William was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his","Pride and Prejudice"
"mornings to driving him out in his gig, and showing him the country: but","Pride and Prejudice"
"when he went away, the whole family returned to their usual employments,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her","Pride and Prejudice"
"cousin by the alteration; for the chief of the time between breakfast","Pride and Prejudice"
"and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden, or in","Pride and Prejudice"
"reading and writing, and looking out of window in his own book room,","Pride and Prejudice"
"which fronted the road. The room in which the ladies sat was backwards.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth at first had rather wondered that Charlotte should not prefer","Pride and Prejudice"
"the dining parlour for common use; it was a better sized room, and had a","Pride and Prejudice"
"pleasanter aspect: but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent","Pride and Prejudice"
"reason for what she did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been","Pride and Prejudice"
"much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively; and","Pride and Prejudice"
"she gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what carriages went","Pride and Prejudice"
"along, and how often especially Miss De Bourgh drove by in her phaeton,","Pride and Prejudice"
"which he never failed coming to inform them of, though it happened","Pride and Prejudice"
"almost every day. She not unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had","Pride and Prejudice"
"a few minutes’ conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever","Pride and Prejudice"
"prevailed on to get out.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to Rosings, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise;","Pride and Prejudice"
"and till Elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings","Pride and Prejudice"
"to be disposed of, she could not understand the sacrifice of so many","Pride and Prejudice"
"hours. Now and then they were honoured with a call from her Ladyship,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during","Pride and Prejudice"
"these visits. She examined into their employments, looked at their work,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and advised them to do it differently; found fault with the arrangement","Pride and Prejudice"
"of the furniture, or detected the housemaid in negligence; and if she","Pride and Prejudice"
"accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it only for the sake of finding","Pride and Prejudice"
"out that Mrs. Collins’s joints of meat were too large for her family.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in the","Pride and Prejudice"
"commission of the peace for the county, she was a most active magistrate","Pride and Prejudice"
"in her own parish, the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be","Pride and Prejudice"
"quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she sallied forth into the","Pride and Prejudice"

"The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a week;","Pride and Prejudice"
"and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being only one","Pride and Prejudice"
"card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was the counterpart","Pride and Prejudice"
"of the first. Their other engagements were few, as the style of living","Pride and Prejudice"
"of the neighbourhood in general was beyond the Collinses’ reach. This,","Pride and Prejudice"
"however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and upon the whole she spent her time","Pride and Prejudice"
"comfortably enough: there were half hours of pleasant conversation with","Pride and Prejudice"
"Charlotte, and the weather was so fine for the time of year, that she","Pride and Prejudice"
"had often great enjoyment out of doors. Her favourite walk, and where","Pride and Prejudice"
"she frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine, was","Pride and Prejudice"
"along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where there was","Pride and Prejudice"
"a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but herself, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"where she felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine’s curiosity.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"In this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to bring an","Pride and Prejudice"
"addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a circle must be","Pride and Prejudice"
"important. Elizabeth had heard, soon after her arrival, that Mr. Darcy","Pride and Prejudice"
"was expected there in the course of a few weeks; and though there were","Pride and Prejudice"
"not many of her acquaintance whom she did not prefer, his coming would","Pride and Prejudice"
"furnish one comparatively new to look at in their Rosings parties, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"she might be amused in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley’s designs on him","Pride and Prejudice"
"were, by his behaviour to his cousin, for whom he was evidently destined","Pride and Prejudice"
"by Lady Catherine, who talked of his coming with the greatest","Pride and Prejudice"
"satisfaction, spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment","Pride and Prejudice"
"before their approach was announced by the door-bell, and shortly","Pride and Prejudice"
"afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room. Colonel Fitzwilliam,","Pride and Prejudice"
"who led the way, was about thirty, not handsome, but in person and","Pride and Prejudice"

"courtesied to him, without saying a word.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly, with the","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Colonel Fitzwilliam’s manners were very much admired at the Parsonage,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasure of","Pride and Prejudice"
"their engagements at Rosings. It was some days, however, before they","Pride and Prejudice"
"received any invitation thither, for while there were visitors in the","Pride and Prejudice"
"house they could not be necessary; and it was not till Easter-day,","Pride and Prejudice"
"almost a week after the gentlemen’s arrival, that they were honoured by","Pride and Prejudice"
"such an attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to","Pride and Prejudice"
"come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very little","Pride and Prejudice"
"of either Lady Catherine or her daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had called","Pride and Prejudice"
"at the Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr. Darcy they had","Pride and Prejudice"
"only seen at church.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The invitation was accepted, of course, and at a proper hour they joined","Pride and Prejudice"
"the party in Lady Catherine’s drawing-room. Her Ladyship received them","Pride and Prejudice"
"civilly, but it was plain that their company was by no means so","Pride and Prejudice"
"acceptable as when she could get nobody else; and she was, in fact,","Pride and Prejudice"
"almost engrossed by her nephews, speaking to them, especially to Darcy,","Pride and Prejudice"
"much more than to any other person in the room.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them: anything was a","Pride and Prejudice"
"welcome relief to him at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins’s pretty friend had,","Pride and Prejudice"
"moreover, caught his fancy very much. He now seated himself by her, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying","Pride and Prejudice"
"at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so","Pride and Prejudice"
"well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much","Pride and Prejudice"
"spirit and flow as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as","Pride and Prejudice"
"well as of Mr. Darcy. _His_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned","Pride and Prejudice"
"towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her Ladyship, after a","Pride and Prejudice"
"while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged, for she did not","Pride and Prejudice"
"scruple to call out,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are talking","Pride and Prejudice"
"of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it is.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“We were talking of music, madam,” said he, when no longer able to avoid","Pride and Prejudice"
"a reply.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my delight. I","Pride and Prejudice"
"must have my share in the conversation, if you are speaking of music.","Pride and Prejudice"
"There are few people in England, I suppose, who have more true","Pride and Prejudice"
"enjoyment of music than myself, or a better natural taste. If I had ever","Pride and Prejudice"
"learnt, I should have been a great proficient. And so would Anne, if her","Pride and Prejudice"
"health had allowed her to apply. I am confident that she would have","Pride and Prejudice"
"performed delightfully. How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his sister’s proficiency.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I am very glad to hear such a good account of her,” said Lady","Pride and Prejudice"
"Catherine; “and pray tell her from me, that she cannot expect to excel,","Pride and Prejudice"
"if she does not practise a great deal.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I assure you, madam,” he replied, “that she does not need such advice.","Pride and Prejudice"
"She practises very constantly.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next write","Pride and Prejudice"
"to her, I shall charge her not to neglect it on any account. I often","Pride and Prejudice"
"tell young ladies, that no excellence in music is to be acquired without","Pride and Prejudice"
"constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet several times, that she will","Pride and Prejudice"
"never play really well, unless she practises more; and though Mrs.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Collins has no instrument, she is very welcome, as I have often told","Pride and Prejudice"
"her, to come to Rosings every day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Jenkinson’s room. She would be in nobody’s way, you know, in that part","Pride and Prejudice"
"of the house.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his aunt’s ill-breeding, and made","Pride and Prejudice"
"no answer.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having","Pride and Prejudice"
"promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument. He","Pride and Prejudice"
"drew a chair near her. Lady Catherine listened to half a song, and then","Pride and Prejudice"
"talked, as before, to her other nephew; till the latter walked away from","Pride and Prejudice"
"her, and moving with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte,","Pride and Prejudice"
"stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performer’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"countenance. Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first","Pride and Prejudice"
"convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile, and said,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear","Pride and Prejudice"
"me. But I will not be alarmed, though your sister _does_ play so well.","Pride and Prejudice"
"There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at","Pride and Prejudice"
"the will of others. My courage always rises with every attempt to","Pride and Prejudice"
"intimidate me.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I shall not say that you are mistaken,” he replied, “because you could","Pride and Prejudice"
"not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you; and I","Pride and Prejudice"
"have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know, that you","Pride and Prejudice"
"find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which, in fact,","Pride and Prejudice"
"are not your own.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to","Pride and Prejudice"
"Colonel Fitzwilliam, “Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of","Pride and Prejudice"
"me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am particularly unlucky","Pride and Prejudice"
"in meeting with a person so well able to expose my real character, in a","Pride and Prejudice"
"part of the world where I had hoped to pass myself off with some degree","Pride and Prejudice"
"of credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it is very ungenerous in you to mention","Pride and Prejudice"
"all that you knew to my disadvantage in Hertfordshire--and, give me","Pride and Prejudice"
"leave to say, very impolitic too--for it is provoking me to retaliate,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I am not afraid of you,” said he, smilingly.","Pride and Prejudice"

"Fitzwilliam. “I should like to know how he behaves among strangers.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You shall hear, then--but prepare for something very dreadful. The","Pride and Prejudice"
"first time of my ever seeing him in Hertfordshire, you must know, was at","Pride and Prejudice"
"a ball--and at this ball, what do you think he did? He danced only four","Pride and Prejudice"
"dances! I am sorry to pain you, but so it was. He danced only four","Pride and Prejudice"
"dances, though gentlemen were scarce; and, to my certain knowledge, more","Pride and Prejudice"
"than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner. Mr. Darcy,","Pride and Prejudice"
"you cannot deny the fact.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the assembly","Pride and Prejudice"
"beyond my own party.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well, Colonel","Pride and Prejudice"
"Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your orders.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Perhaps,” said Darcy, “I should have judged better had I sought an","Pride and Prejudice"
"introduction, but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to strangers.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?” said Elizabeth, still","Pride and Prejudice"

"“I can answer your question,” said Fitzwilliam, “without applying to","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,” said Darcy,","Pride and Prejudice"
"“of conversing easily with those I have never seen before. I cannot","Pride and Prejudice"
"catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested in their","Pride and Prejudice"
"concerns, as I often see done.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“My fingers,” said Elizabeth, “do not move over this instrument in the","Pride and Prejudice"
"masterly manner which I see so many women’s do. They have not the same","Pride and Prejudice"
"force or rapidity, and do not produce the same expression. But then I","Pride and Prejudice"
"have always supposed it to be my own fault--because I would not take","Pride and Prejudice"
"the trouble of practising. It is not that I do not believe _my_ fingers","Pride and Prejudice"
"as capable as any other woman’s of superior execution.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Darcy smiled and said, “You are perfectly right. You have employed your","Pride and Prejudice"

"think anything wanting. We neither of us perform to strangers.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to know","Pride and Prejudice"
"what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began playing again.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening for a few minutes, said","Pride and Prejudice"
"to Darcy,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"could have the advantage of a London master. She has a very good notion","Pride and Prejudice"
"of fingering, though her taste is not equal to Anne’s. Anne would have","Pride and Prejudice"
"been a delightful performer, had her health allowed her to learn.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth looked at Darcy, to see how cordially he assented to his","Pride and Prejudice"
"cousin’s praise: but neither at that moment nor at any other could she","Pride and Prejudice"
"discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss","Pride and Prejudice"

"been just as likely to marry _her_, had she been his relation.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to Jane,","Pride and Prejudice"
"while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the village,","Pride and Prejudice"
"when she was startled by a ring at the door, the certain signal of a","Pride and Prejudice"
"visitor. As she had heard no carriage, she thought it not unlikely to be","Pride and Prejudice"
"Lady Catherine; and under that apprehension was putting away her","Pride and Prejudice"
"half-finished letter, that she might escape all impertinent questions,","Pride and Prejudice"
"when the door opened, and to her very great surprise Mr. Darcy, and Mr.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Darcy only, entered the room.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"He seemed astonished too on finding her alone, and apologized for his","Pride and Prejudice"
"intrusion, by letting her know that he had understood all the ladies to","Pride and Prejudice"
"be within.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"They then sat down, and when her inquiries after Rosings were made,","Pride and Prejudice"
"seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was absolutely","Pride and Prejudice"
"necessary, therefore, to think of something; and in this emergency","Pride and Prejudice"
"recollecting _when_ she had seen him last in Hertfordshire, and feeling","Pride and Prejudice"
"curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty","Pride and Prejudice"
"departure, she observed,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr. Darcy!","Pride and Prejudice"
"It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley to see you","Pride and Prejudice"
"all after him so soon; for, if I recollect right, he went but the day","Pride and Prejudice"
"before. He and his sisters were well, I hope, when you left London?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Perfectly so, I thank you.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She found that she was to receive no other answer; and, after a short","Pride and Prejudice"
"pause, added,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of ever","Pride and Prejudice"
"returning to Netherfield again?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I have never heard him say so; but it is probable that he may spend","Pride and Prejudice"
"very little of his time there in future. He has many friends, and he is","Pride and Prejudice"
"at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually","Pride and Prejudice"
"increasing.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“If he means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better for the","Pride and Prejudice"
"neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely, for then we","Pride and Prejudice"
"might possibly get a settled family there. But, perhaps, Mr. Bingley did","Pride and Prejudice"
"not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as","Pride and Prejudice"
"for his own, and we must expect him to keep or quit it on the same","Pride and Prejudice"
"principle.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I should not be surprised,” said Darcy, “if he were to give it up as","Pride and Prejudice"
"soon as any eligible purchase offers.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth made no answer. She was afraid of talking longer of his","Pride and Prejudice"
"friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to leave the","Pride and Prejudice"
"trouble of finding a subject to him.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"He took the hint and soon began with, “This seems a very comfortable","Pride and Prejudice"
"house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to it when Mr.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Collins first came to Hunsford.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I believe she did--and I am sure she could not have bestowed her","Pride and Prejudice"
"kindness on a more grateful object.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Mr. Collins appears very fortunate in his choice of a wife.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yes, indeed; his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of","Pride and Prejudice"
"the very few sensible women who would have accepted him, or have made","Pride and Prejudice"
"him happy if they had. My friend has an excellent understanding--though","Pride and Prejudice"
"I am not certain that I consider her marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest","Pride and Prejudice"
"thing she ever did. She seems perfectly happy, however; and, in a","Pride and Prejudice"
"prudential light, it is certainly a very good match for her.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“It must be very agreeable to her to be settled within so easy a","Pride and Prejudice"
"distance of her own family and friends.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“An easy distance do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a day’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"journey. Yes, I call it a very easy distance.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I should never have considered the distance as one of the _advantages_","Pride and Prejudice"
"of the match,” cried Elizabeth. “I should never have said Mrs. Collins","Pride and Prejudice"
"was settled _near_ her family.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything beyond","Pride and Prejudice"
"the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would appear far.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"As he spoke there was a sort of smile, which Elizabeth fancied she","Pride and Prejudice"
"understood; he must be supposing her to be thinking of Jane and","Pride and Prejudice"
"Netherfield, and she blushed as she answered,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her","Pride and Prejudice"
"family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on many","Pride and Prejudice"
"varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the expense of","Pride and Prejudice"
"travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But that is not the","Pride and Prejudice"
"case _here_. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a comfortable income, but not","Pride and Prejudice"
"such a one as will allow of frequent journeys--and I am persuaded my","Pride and Prejudice"
"friend would not call herself _near_ her family under less than _half_","Pride and Prejudice"
"the present distance.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Darcy drew his chair a little towards her, and said, “_You_ cannot","Pride and Prejudice"
"have a right to such very strong local attachment. _You_ cannot have","Pride and Prejudice"
"been always at Longbourn.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change of","Pride and Prejudice"
"feeling; he drew back his chair, took a newspaper from the table, and,","Pride and Prejudice"
"glancing over it, said, in a colder voice,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Are you pleased with Kent?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either side","Pride and Prejudice"
"calm and concise--and soon put an end to by the entrance of Charlotte","Pride and Prejudice"
"and her sister, just returned from their walk. The _tête-à-tête_","Pride and Prejudice"
"surprised them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his","Pride and Prejudice"
"intruding on Miss Bennet, and, after sitting a few minutes longer,","Pride and Prejudice"
"without saying much to anybody, went away.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“What can be the meaning of this?” said Charlotte, as soon as he was","Pride and Prejudice"
"gone. “My dear Eliza, he must be in love with you, or he would never","Pride and Prejudice"
"have called on us in this familiar way.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"But when Elizabeth told of his silence, it did not seem very likely,","Pride and Prejudice"
"even to Charlotte’s wishes, to be the case; and, after various","Pride and Prejudice"
"conjectures, they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from","Pride and Prejudice"
"the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was the more probable","Pride and Prejudice"
"from the time of year. All field sports were over. Within doors there","Pride and Prejudice"
"was Lady Catherine, books, and a billiard table, but gentlemen cannot be","Pride and Prejudice"
"always within doors; and in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the","Pride and Prejudice"
"pleasantness of the walk to it, or of the people who lived in it, the","Pride and Prejudice"
"two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither","Pride and Prejudice"
"almost every day. They called at various times of the morning, sometimes","Pride and Prejudice"
"separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by their","Pride and Prejudice"
"aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam came because he","Pride and Prejudice"
"had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which of course recommended","Pride and Prejudice"
"him still more; and Elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in","Pride and Prejudice"
"being with him, as well as by his evident admiration, of her former","Pride and Prejudice"
"favourite, George Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she saw there","Pride and Prejudice"
"was less captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam’s manners, she","Pride and Prejudice"
"believed he might have the best informed mind.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage it was more difficult","Pride and Prejudice"
"to understand. It could not be for society, as he frequently sat there","Pride and Prejudice"
"ten minutes together without opening his lips; and when he did speak, it","Pride and Prejudice"
"seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choice--a sacrifice to","Pride and Prejudice"
"propriety, not a pleasure to himself. He seldom appeared really","Pride and Prejudice"
"animated. Mrs. Collins knew not what to make of him. Colonel","Pride and Prejudice"
"Fitzwilliam’s occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was","Pride and Prejudice"
"generally different, which her own knowledge of him could not have told","Pride and Prejudice"
"her; and as she would have liked to believe this change the effect of","Pride and Prejudice"
"love, and the object of that love her friend Eliza, she set herself","Pride and Prejudice"
"seriously to work to find it out: she watched him whenever they were at","Pride and Prejudice"
"Rosings, and whenever he came to Hunsford; but without much success. He","Pride and Prejudice"
"certainly looked at her friend a great deal, but the expression of that","Pride and Prejudice"
"look was disputable. It was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she often","Pride and Prejudice"
"doubted whether there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it","Pride and Prejudice"
"seemed nothing but absence of mind.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of his","Pride and Prejudice"
"being partial to her, but Elizabeth always laughed at the idea; and Mrs.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Collins did not think it right to press the subject, from the danger of","Pride and Prejudice"
"raising expectations which might only end in disappointment; for in her","Pride and Prejudice"
"opinion it admitted not of a doubt, that all her friend’s dislike would","Pride and Prejudice"
"vanish, if she could suppose him to be in her power.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"In her kind schemes for Elizabeth, she sometimes planned her marrying","Pride and Prejudice"
"Colonel Fitzwilliam. He was, beyond comparison, the pleasantest man: he","Pride and Prejudice"
"certainly admired her, and his situation in life was most eligible; but,","Pride and Prejudice"
"to counterbalance these advantages, Mr. Darcy had considerable patronage","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"More than once did Elizabeth, in her ramble within the park,","Pride and Prejudice"
"unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She felt all the perverseness of the","Pride and Prejudice"
"mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought; and, to","Pride and Prejudice"
"prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him, at first,","Pride and Prejudice"
"that it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could occur a second time,","Pride and Prejudice"
"therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and even the third. It seemed like","Pride and Prejudice"
"wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary penance; for on these occasions it was","Pride and Prejudice"
"not merely a few formal inquiries and an awkward pause and then away,","Pride and Prejudice"
"but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her. He","Pride and Prejudice"
"never said a great deal, nor did she give herself the trouble of talking","Pride and Prejudice"
"or of listening much; but it struck her in the course of their third","Pride and Prejudice"
"rencounter that he was asking some odd unconnected questions--about her","Pride and Prejudice"
"pleasure in being at Hunsford, her love of solitary walks, and her","Pride and Prejudice"
"opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins’s happiness; and that in speaking of","Pride and Prejudice"
"Rosings, and her not perfectly understanding the house, he seemed to","Pride and Prejudice"
"expect that whenever she came into Kent again she would be staying","Pride and Prejudice"
"_there_ too. His words seemed to imply it. Could he have Colonel","Pride and Prejudice"
"Fitzwilliam in his thoughts? She supposed, if he meant anything, he must","Pride and Prejudice"
"mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed her","Pride and Prejudice"
"a little, and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the","Pride and Prejudice"
"pales opposite the Parsonage.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She was engaged one day, as she walked, in re-perusing Jane’s last","Pride and Prejudice"
"letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had not","Pride and Prejudice"
"written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by Mr. Darcy,","Pride and Prejudice"
"she saw, on looking up, that Colonel Fitzwilliam was meeting her.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Putting away the letter immediately, and forcing a smile, she said,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I did not know before that you ever walked this way.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I have been making the tour of the park,” he replied, “as I generally","Pride and Prejudice"
"do every year, and intended to close it with a call at the Parsonage.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Are you going much farther?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“No, I should have turned in a moment.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"And accordingly she did turn, and they walked towards the Parsonage","Pride and Prejudice"
"together.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?” said she.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He","Pride and Prejudice"
"arranges the business just as he pleases.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least","Pride and Prejudice"
"great pleasure in the power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems","Pride and Prejudice"
"more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“He likes to have his own way very well,” replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.","Pride and Prejudice"
"“But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it than","Pride and Prejudice"
"many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak","Pride and Prejudice"
"feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and","Pride and Prejudice"
"dependence.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of","Pride and Prejudice"
"either. Now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and","Pride and Prejudice"
"dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going","Pride and Prejudice"
"wherever you chose or procuring anything you had a fancy for?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have","Pride and Prejudice"
"experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater","Pride and Prejudice"
"weight, I may suffer from the want of money. Younger sons cannot marry","Pride and Prejudice"
"where they like.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often","Pride and Prejudice"
"do.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many in","Pride and Prejudice"
"my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to","Pride and Prejudice"
"money.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Is this,” thought Elizabeth, “meant for me?” and she coloured at the","Pride and Prejudice"
"idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, “And pray, what is","Pride and Prejudice"
"the usual price of an earl’s younger son? Unless the elder brother is","Pride and Prejudice"
"very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt","Pride and Prejudice"
"a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,","Pride and Prejudice"
"she soon afterwards said,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of","Pride and Prejudice"
"having somebody at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a","Pride and Prejudice"
"lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister does as well","Pride and Prejudice"
"for the present; and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he","Pride and Prejudice"
"likes with her.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“No,” said Colonel Fitzwilliam, “that is an advantage which he must","Pride and Prejudice"
"divide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Are you, indeed? And pray what sort of a guardian do you make? Does","Pride and Prejudice"
"your charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes","Pride and Prejudice"
"a little difficult to manage; and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she","Pride and Prejudice"
"may like to have her own way.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"As she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner","Pride and Prejudice"
"in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to","Pride and Prejudice"
"give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other","Pride and Prejudice"
"got pretty near the truth. She directly replied,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare","Pride and Prejudice"
"say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a","Pride and Prejudice"
"very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and","Pride and Prejudice"
"Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant, gentlemanlike","Pride and Prejudice"
"man--he is a great friend of Darcy’s.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Oh yes,” said Elizabeth drily--“Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in","Pride and Prejudice"
"those points where he most wants care. From something that he told me","Pride and Prejudice"
"in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted","Pride and Prejudice"
"to him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose","Pride and Prejudice"
"that Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“What is it you mean?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“It is a circumstance which Darcy of course could not wish to be","Pride and Prejudice"
"generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady’s family it","Pride and Prejudice"
"would be an unpleasant thing.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You may depend upon my not mentioning it.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself","Pride and Prejudice"
"on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most","Pride and Prejudice"
"imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other","Pride and Prejudice"
"particulars; and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him","Pride and Prejudice"
"the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from","Pride and Prejudice"
"knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Did Mr. Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I understood that there were some very strong objections against the","Pride and Prejudice"
"lady.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“And what arts did he use to separate them?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“He did not talk to me of his own arts,” said Fitzwilliam, smiling. “He","Pride and Prejudice"
"only told me what I have now told you.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with","Pride and Prejudice"
"indignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she","Pride and Prejudice"
"was so thoughtful.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I am thinking of what you have been telling me,” said she. “Your","Pride and Prejudice"
"cousin’s conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the","Pride and Prejudice"
"judge?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his","Pride and Prejudice"
"friend’s inclination; or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to","Pride and Prejudice"
"determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy. But,”","Pride and Prejudice"
"she continued, recollecting herself, “as we know none of the","Pride and Prejudice"
"particulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed","Pride and Prejudice"
"that there was much affection in the case.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“That is not an unnatural surmise,” said Fitzwilliam; “but it is","Pride and Prejudice"
"lessening the honour of my cousin’s triumph very sadly.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"This was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and,","Pride and Prejudice"
"therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent","Pride and Prejudice"
"matters till they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her own room,","Pride and Prejudice"
"as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption","Pride and Prejudice"
"of all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other","Pride and Prejudice"
"people could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There","Pride and Prejudice"
"could not exist in the world _two_ men over whom Mr. Darcy could have","Pride and Prejudice"
"such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures","Pride and Prejudice"
"taken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane, she had never doubted; but she","Pride and Prejudice"
"had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and","Pride and Prejudice"
"arrangement of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him,","Pride and Prejudice"
"_he_ was the cause--his pride and caprice were the cause--of all that","Pride and Prejudice"
"Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a","Pride and Prejudice"
"while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart","Pride and Prejudice"
"in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have","Pride and Prejudice"
"inflicted.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“There were some very strong objections against the lady,” were Colonel","Pride and Prejudice"
"Fitzwilliam’s words; and these strong objections probably were, her","Pride and Prejudice"
"having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in","Pride and Prejudice"
"business in London.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“To Jane herself,” she exclaimed, “there could be no possibility of","Pride and Prejudice"
"objection,--all loveliness and goodness as she is! Her understanding","Pride and Prejudice"
"excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither could","Pride and Prejudice"
"anything be urged against my father, who, though with some","Pride and Prejudice"
"peculiarities, has abilities which Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and respectability which he will probably never reach.” When she thought","Pride and Prejudice"
"of her mother, indeed, her confidence gave way a little; but she would","Pride and Prejudice"
"not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from","Pride and Prejudice"
"the want of importance in his friend’s connections than from their want","Pride and Prejudice"
"of sense; and she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly","Pride and Prejudice"
"governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of","Pride and Prejudice"
"retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a","Pride and Prejudice"
"headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to","Pride and Prejudice"
"her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her","Pride and Prejudice"
"cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins,","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as","Pride and Prejudice"
"much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the","Pride and Prejudice"
"examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her","Pride and Prejudice"
"being in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any","Pride and Prejudice"
"revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.","Pride and Prejudice"
"But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that","Pride and Prejudice"
"cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which,","Pride and Prejudice"
"proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly","Pride and Prejudice"
"disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth","Pride and Prejudice"
"noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an","Pride and Prejudice"
"attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a","Pride and Prejudice"
"keener sense of her sister’s sufferings. It was some consolation to","Pride and Prejudice"
"think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be","Pride and Prejudice"
"with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her","Pride and Prejudice"
"spirits, by all that affection could do.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She could not think of Darcy’s leaving Kent without remembering that his","Pride and Prejudice"
"cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear","Pride and Prejudice"
"that he had no intentions at all, and, agreeable as he was, she did not","Pride and Prejudice"
"mean to be unhappy about him.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the","Pride and Prejudice"
"door-bell; and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its","Pride and Prejudice"
"being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in","Pride and Prejudice"
"the evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her. But","Pride and Prejudice"
"this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently","Pride and Prejudice"
"affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the","Pride and Prejudice"
"room. In a hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her","Pride and Prejudice"
"health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.","Pride and Prejudice"
"She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"then getting up walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but","Pride and Prejudice"
"said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her","Pride and Prejudice"
"in an agitated manner, and thus began:--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be","Pride and Prejudice"
"repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love","Pride and Prejudice"
"you.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth’s astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured,","Pride and Prejudice"
"doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately","Pride and Prejudice"
"followed. He spoke well; but there were feelings besides those of the","Pride and Prejudice"
"heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject of","Pride and Prejudice"
"tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority, of its being a","Pride and Prejudice"
"degradation, of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed","Pride and Prejudice"
"to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the","Pride and Prejudice"
"consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his","Pride and Prejudice"
"suit.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to","Pride and Prejudice"
"the compliment of such a man’s affection, and though her intentions did","Pride and Prejudice"
"not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to","Pride and Prejudice"
"receive; till roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost","Pride and Prejudice"
"all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to","Pride and Prejudice"
"answer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with","Pride and Prejudice"
"representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of","Pride and Prejudice"
"all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer; and with","Pride and Prejudice"
"expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of","Pride and Prejudice"
"his hand. As he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a","Pride and Prejudice"
"favourable answer. He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his","Pride and Prejudice"
"countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could only","Pride and Prejudice"
"exasperate farther; and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks","Pride and Prejudice"
"and she said,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to","Pride and Prejudice"
"express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however","Pride and Prejudice"
"unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should be","Pride and Prejudice"
"felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you. But I","Pride and Prejudice"
"cannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly","Pride and Prejudice"
"bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to","Pride and Prejudice"
"anyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be","Pride and Prejudice"
"of short duration. The feelings which you tell me have long prevented","Pride and Prejudice"
"the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in","Pride and Prejudice"
"overcoming it after this explanation.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his eyes fixed","Pride and Prejudice"
"on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than","Pride and Prejudice"
"surprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of","Pride and Prejudice"
"his mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the","Pride and Prejudice"
"appearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed","Pride and Prejudice"
"himself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth’s feelings","Pride and Prejudice"
"dreadful. At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I","Pride and Prejudice"
"might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at","Pride and Prejudice"
"civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I might as well inquire,” replied she, “why, with so evident a design","Pride and Prejudice"
"of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me","Pride and Prejudice"
"against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?","Pride and Prejudice"
"Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil? But I have","Pride and Prejudice"
"other provocations. You know I have. Had not my own feelings decided","Pride and Prejudice"
"against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been","Pride and Prejudice"
"favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept","Pride and Prejudice"
"the man who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the","Pride and Prejudice"
"happiness of a most beloved sister?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion","Pride and Prejudice"
"was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she","Pride and Prejudice"
"continued,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can","Pride and Prejudice"
"excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You dare not,","Pride and Prejudice"
"you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means","Pride and Prejudice"
"of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the","Pride and Prejudice"
"world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for","Pride and Prejudice"
"disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest","Pride and Prejudice"
"kind.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening","Pride and Prejudice"
"with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.","Pride and Prejudice"
"He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Can you deny that you have done it?” she repeated.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"With assumed tranquillity he then replied, “I have no wish of denying","Pride and Prejudice"
"that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your","Pride and Prejudice"
"sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him_ I have been","Pride and Prejudice"
"kinder than towards myself.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,","Pride and Prejudice"
"but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“But it is not merely this affair,” she continued, “on which my dislike","Pride and Prejudice"
"is founded. Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was","Pride and Prejudice"
"decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received","Pride and Prejudice"
"many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to","Pride and Prejudice"
"say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?","Pride and Prejudice"
"or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You take an eager interest in that gentleman’s concerns,” said Darcy,","Pride and Prejudice"
"in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an","Pride and Prejudice"
"interest in him?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“His misfortunes!” repeated Darcy, contemptuously,--“yes, his","Pride and Prejudice"
"misfortunes have been great indeed.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“And of your infliction,” cried Elizabeth, with energy; “You have","Pride and Prejudice"
"reduced him to his present state of poverty--comparative poverty. You","Pride and Prejudice"
"have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed","Pride and Prejudice"
"for him. You have deprived the best years of his life of that","Pride and Prejudice"
"independence which was no less his due than his desert. You have done","Pride and Prejudice"
"all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with","Pride and Prejudice"
"contempt and ridicule.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“And this,” cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,","Pride and Prejudice"
"“is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I","Pride and Prejudice"
"thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this","Pride and Prejudice"
"calculation, are heavy indeed! But, perhaps,” added he, stopping in his","Pride and Prejudice"
"walk, and turning towards her, “these offences might have been","Pride and Prejudice"
"overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the","Pride and Prejudice"
"scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These","Pride and Prejudice"
"bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater","Pride and Prejudice"
"policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my","Pride and Prejudice"
"being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by","Pride and Prejudice"
"reflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and just.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your","Pride and Prejudice"
"connections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose","Pride and Prejudice"
"condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to","Pride and Prejudice"
"the utmost to speak with composure when she said,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your","Pride and Prejudice"
"declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the","Pride and Prejudice"
"concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a","Pride and Prejudice"
"more gentlemanlike manner.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She saw him start at this; but he said nothing, and she continued,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way","Pride and Prejudice"
"that would have tempted me to accept it.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an","Pride and Prejudice"
"expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“From the very beginning, from the first moment, I may almost say, of my","Pride and Prejudice"
"acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest","Pride and Prejudice"
"belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the","Pride and Prejudice"
"feelings of others, were such as to form that groundwork of","Pride and Prejudice"
"disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immovable a","Pride and Prejudice"
"dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the","Pride and Prejudice"
"last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your","Pride and Prejudice"
"feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best","Pride and Prejudice"
"wishes for your health and happiness.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him","Pride and Prejudice"
"the next moment open the front door and quit the house. The tumult of","Pride and Prejudice"
"her mind was now painfully great. She knew not how to support herself,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and, from actual weakness, sat down and cried for half an hour. Her","Pride and Prejudice"
"astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by","Pride and Prejudice"
"every review of it. That she should receive an offer of marriage from","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Darcy! that he should have been in love with her for so many months!","Pride and Prejudice"
"so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections","Pride and Prejudice"
"which had made him prevent his friend’s marrying her sister, and which","Pride and Prejudice"
"must appear at least with equal force in his own case, was almost","Pride and Prejudice"
"incredible! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong","Pride and Prejudice"
"an affection. But his pride, his abominable pride, his shameless avowal","Pride and Prejudice"
"of what he had done with respect to Jane, his unpardonable assurance in","Pride and Prejudice"
"acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner","Pride and Prejudice"
"which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not","Pride and Prejudice"
"attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his","Pride and Prejudice"
"attachment had for a moment excited.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady","Pride and Prejudice"
"Catherine’s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter","Pride and Prejudice"
"Charlotte’s observation, and hurried her away to her room.","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations","Pride and Prejudice"
"which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the","Pride and Prejudice"
"surprise of what had happened: it was impossible to think of anything","Pride and Prejudice"
"else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after","Pride and Prejudice"
"breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding","Pride and Prejudice"
"directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,","Pride and Prejudice"
"she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road. The","Pride and Prejudice"
"park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one","Pride and Prejudice"
"of the gates into the ground.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was","Pride and Prejudice"
"tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and","Pride and Prejudice"
"look into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had","Pride and Prejudice"
"made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the","Pride and Prejudice"
"verdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her","Pride and Prejudice"
"walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove","Pride and Prejudice"
"which edged the park: he was moving that way; and fearful of its being","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was","Pride and Prejudice"
"now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness,","Pride and Prejudice"
"pronounced her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself called,","Pride and Prejudice"
"though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again","Pride and Prejudice"
"towards the gate. He had by that time reached it also; and, holding out","Pride and Prejudice"
"a letter, which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty","Pride and Prejudice"
"composure, “I have been walking in the grove some time, in the hope of","Pride and Prejudice"
"meeting you. Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?” and","Pride and Prejudice"
"then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon","Pride and Prejudice"
"out of sight.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder,","Pride and Prejudice"
"perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written","Pride and Prejudice"
"quite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise","Pride and Prejudice"
"full. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated","Pride and Prejudice"
"from Rosings, at eight o’clock in the morning, and was as follows:--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of","Pride and Prejudice"
"its containing any repetition of those sentiments, or renewal of those","Pride and Prejudice"
"offers, which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any","Pride and Prejudice"
"intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes,","Pride and Prejudice"
"which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the","Pride and Prejudice"
"effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion,","Pride and Prejudice"
"should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written","Pride and Prejudice"
"and read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand","Pride and Prejudice"
"your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I","Pride and Prejudice"
"demand it of your justice.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal","Pride and Prejudice"
"magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was,","Pride and Prejudice"
"that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley","Pride and Prejudice"
"from your sister,--and the other, that I had, in defiance of various","Pride and Prejudice"
"claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate","Pride and Prejudice"
"prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and","Pride and Prejudice"
"wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged","Pride and Prejudice"
"favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other","Pride and Prejudice"
"dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect","Pride and Prejudice"
"its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young","Pride and Prejudice"
"persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could","Pride and Prejudice"
"bear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last","Pride and Prejudice"
"night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope","Pride and Prejudice"
"to be in future secured, when the following account of my actions and","Pride and Prejudice"
"their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them which is due","Pride and Prejudice"
"to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be","Pride and Prejudice"
"offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity must","Pride and Prejudice"
"be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd. I had not been long in","Pride and Prejudice"
"Hertfordshire before I saw, in common with others, that Bingley","Pride and Prejudice"
"preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country. But","Pride and Prejudice"
"it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any","Pride and Prejudice"
"apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment. I had often seen him","Pride and Prejudice"
"in love before. At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with","Pride and Prejudice"
"you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas’s accidental","Pride and Prejudice"
"information, that Bingley’s attentions to your sister had given rise to","Pride and Prejudice"
"a general expectation of their marriage. He spoke of it as a certain","Pride and Prejudice"
"event, of which the time alone could be undecided. From that moment I","Pride and Prejudice"
"observed my friend’s behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive","Pride and Prejudice"
"that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed","Pride and Prejudice"
"in him. Your sister I also watched. Her look and manners were open,","Pride and Prejudice"
"cheerful, and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar","Pride and Prejudice"
"regard; and I remained convinced, from the evening’s scrutiny, that","Pride and Prejudice"
"though she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite","Pride and Prejudice"
"them by any participation of sentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken","Pride and Prejudice"
"here, _I_ must have been in an error. Your superior knowledge of your","Pride and Prejudice"
"sister must make the latter probable. If it be so, if I have been misled","Pride and Prejudice"
"by such error to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been","Pride and Prejudice"
"unreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of","Pride and Prejudice"
"your sister’s countenance and air was such as might have given the most","Pride and Prejudice"
"acute observer a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart","Pride and Prejudice"
"was not likely to be easily touched. That I was desirous of believing","Pride and Prejudice"
"her indifferent is certain; but I will venture to say that my","Pride and Prejudice"
"investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or","Pride and Prejudice"
"fears. I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I","Pride and Prejudice"
"believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.","Pride and Prejudice"
"My objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last night","Pride and Prejudice"
"acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside","Pride and Prejudice"
"in my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to","Pride and Prejudice"
"my friend as to me. But there were other causes of repugnance; causes","Pride and Prejudice"
"which, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both","Pride and Prejudice"
"instances, I had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not","Pride and Prejudice"
"immediately before me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The","Pride and Prejudice"
"situation of your mother’s family, though objectionable, was nothing in","Pride and Prejudice"
"comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost","Pride and Prejudice"
"uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"occasionally even by your father:--pardon me,--it pains me to offend","Pride and Prejudice"
"you. But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and your displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you","Pride and Prejudice"
"consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid","Pride and Prejudice"
"any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on","Pride and Prejudice"
"you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and","Pride and Prejudice"
"disposition of both. I will only say, farther, that from what passed","Pride and Prejudice"
"that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every","Pride and Prejudice"
"inducement heightened, which could have led me before to preserve my","Pride and Prejudice"
"friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection. He left","Pride and Prejudice"
"Netherfield for London on the day following, as you, I am certain,","Pride and Prejudice"
"remember, with the design of soon returning. The part which I acted is","Pride and Prejudice"
"now to be explained. His sisters’ uneasiness had been equally excited","Pride and Prejudice"
"with my own: our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike","Pride and Prejudice"
"sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we","Pride and Prejudice"
"shortly resolved on joining him directly in London. We accordingly","Pride and Prejudice"
"went--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my","Pride and Prejudice"
"friend the certain evils of such a choice. I described and enforced them","Pride and Prejudice"
"earnestly. But however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed","Pride and Prejudice"
"his determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately have","Pride and Prejudice"
"prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance, which","Pride and Prejudice"
"I hesitated not in giving, of your sister’s indifference. He had before","Pride and Prejudice"
"believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal,","Pride and Prejudice"
"regard. But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger","Pride and Prejudice"
"dependence on my judgment than on his own. To convince him, therefore,","Pride and Prejudice"
"that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point. To persuade","Pride and Prejudice"
"him against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been","Pride and Prejudice"
"given, was scarcely the work of a moment. I cannot blame myself for","Pride and Prejudice"
"having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct, in the whole","Pride and Prejudice"
"affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I","Pride and Prejudice"
"condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him","Pride and Prejudice"
"your sister’s being in town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bingley; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might","Pride and Prejudice"
"have met without ill consequence is, perhaps, probable; but his regard","Pride and Prejudice"
"did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some","Pride and Prejudice"
"danger. Perhaps this concealment, this disguise, was beneath me. It is","Pride and Prejudice"
"done, however, and it was done for the best. On this subject I have","Pride and Prejudice"
"nothing more to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your","Pride and Prejudice"
"sister’s feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which","Pride and Prejudice"
"governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not","Pride and Prejudice"
"yet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other, more weighty","Pride and Prejudice"
"accusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by","Pride and Prejudice"
"laying before you the whole of his connection with my family. Of what he","Pride and Prejudice"
"has _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what I","Pride and Prejudice"
"shall relate I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years","Pride and Prejudice"
"the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good conduct in","Pride and Prejudice"
"the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service","Pride and Prejudice"
"to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his kindness was","Pride and Prejudice"
"therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"afterwards at Cambridge; most important assistance, as his own father,","Pride and Prejudice"
"always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to","Pride and Prejudice"
"give him a gentleman’s education. My father was not only fond of this","Pride and Prejudice"
"young man’s society, whose manners were always engaging, he had also the","Pride and Prejudice"
"highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession,","Pride and Prejudice"
"intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is many, many years","Pride and Prejudice"
"since I first began to think of him in a very different manner. The","Pride and Prejudice"
"vicious propensities, the want of principle, which he was careful to","Pride and Prejudice"
"guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the","Pride and Prejudice"
"observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who","Pride and Prejudice"
"had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy","Pride and Prejudice"
"could not have. Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree you","Pride and Prejudice"
"only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has","Pride and Prejudice"
"created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding","Pride and Prejudice"
"his real character. It adds even another motive. My excellent father","Pride and Prejudice"
"died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the","Pride and Prejudice"
"last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to","Pride and Prejudice"
"promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might","Pride and Prejudice"
"allow, and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living","Pride and Prejudice"
"might be his as soon as it became vacant. There was also a legacy of","Pride and Prejudice"
"one thousand pounds. His own father did not long survive mine; and","Pride and Prejudice"
"within half a year from these events Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me","Pride and Prejudice"
"that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should","Pride and Prejudice"
"not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate","Pride and Prejudice"
"pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be","Pride and Prejudice"
"benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying the law, and I","Pride and Prejudice"
"must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very","Pride and Prejudice"
"insufficient support therein. I rather wished than believed him to be","Pride and Prejudice"
"sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his","Pride and Prejudice"
"proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman. The","Pride and Prejudice"
"business was therefore soon settled. He resigned all claim to assistance","Pride and Prejudice"
"in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to","Pride and Prejudice"
"receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection","Pride and Prejudice"
"between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him","Pride and Prejudice"
"to Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town, I believe, he","Pride and Prejudice"
"chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence; and being","Pride and Prejudice"
"now free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and","Pride and Prejudice"
"dissipation. For about three years I heard little of him; but on the","Pride and Prejudice"
"decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him,","Pride and Prejudice"
"he applied to me again by letter for the presentation. His","Pride and Prejudice"
"circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it,","Pride and Prejudice"
"were exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most unprofitable study,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would present","Pride and Prejudice"
"him to the living in question--of which he trusted there could be little","Pride and Prejudice"
"doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and I could not have forgotten my revered father’s intentions. You will","Pride and Prejudice"
"hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for","Pride and Prejudice"
"resisting every repetition of it. His resentment was in proportion to","Pride and Prejudice"
"the distress of his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in","Pride and Prejudice"
"his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself. After this","Pride and Prejudice"
"period, every appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived, I","Pride and Prejudice"
"know not. But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my","Pride and Prejudice"
"notice. I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget","Pride and Prejudice"
"myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me","Pride and Prejudice"
"to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of","Pride and Prejudice"
"your secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left","Pride and Prejudice"
"to the guardianship of my mother’s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"myself. About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an","Pride and Prejudice"
"establishment formed for her in London; and last summer she went with","Pride and Prejudice"
"the lady who presided over it to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior","Pride and Prejudice"
"acquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were","Pride and Prejudice"
"most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid he so far","Pride and Prejudice"
"recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a","Pride and Prejudice"
"strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was","Pride and Prejudice"
"persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement. She","Pride and Prejudice"
"was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her","Pride and Prejudice"
"imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to","Pride and Prejudice"
"herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended","Pride and Prejudice"
"elopement; and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving","Pride and Prejudice"
"and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father,","Pride and Prejudice"
"acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and how I","Pride and Prejudice"
"acted. Regard for my sister’s credit and feelings prevented any public","Pride and Prejudice"
"exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr. Wickham’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"chief object was unquestionably my sister’s fortune, which is thirty","Pride and Prejudice"
"thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging","Pride and Prejudice"
"himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have been","Pride and Prejudice"
"complete indeed. This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in","Pride and Prejudice"
"which we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely","Pride and Prejudice"
"reject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty","Pride and Prejudice"
"towards Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of","Pride and Prejudice"
"falsehood, he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be","Pride and Prejudice"
"wondered at, ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning","Pride and Prejudice"
"either. Detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly","Pride and Prejudice"

"Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to","Pride and Prejudice"
"contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of","Pride and Prejudice"
"its contents. But such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly","Pride and Prejudice"
"she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did","Pride and Prejudice"
"she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;","Pride and Prejudice"
"and steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation to","Pride and Prejudice"
"give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong","Pride and Prejudice"
"prejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of","Pride and Prejudice"
"what had happened at Netherfield. She read with an eagerness which","Pride and Prejudice"
"hardly left her power of comprehension; and from impatience of knowing","Pride and Prejudice"
"what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the","Pride and Prejudice"
"sense of the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"insensibility she instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the","Pride and Prejudice"
"real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any","Pride and Prejudice"
"wish of doing him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done","Pride and Prejudice"
"which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all","Pride and Prejudice"
"pride and insolence.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham--when","Pride and Prejudice"
"she read, with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events which,","Pride and Prejudice"
"if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which","Pride and Prejudice"
"bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself--her feelings","Pride and Prejudice"
"were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished","Pride and Prejudice"
"to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, “This must be false!","Pride and Prejudice"
"This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!”--and when she had","Pride and Prejudice"
"gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the","Pride and Prejudice"
"last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not","Pride and Prejudice"
"regard it, that she would never look in it again.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on","Pride and Prejudice"
"nothing, she walked on; but it would not do: in half a minute the letter","Pride and Prejudice"
"was unfolded again; and collecting herself as well as she could, she","Pride and Prejudice"
"again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.","Pride and Prejudice"
"The account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly","Pride and Prejudice"
"what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy,","Pride and Prejudice"
"though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his","Pride and Prejudice"
"own words. So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to","Pride and Prejudice"
"the will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living","Pride and Prejudice"
"was fresh in her memory; and as she recalled his very words, it was","Pride and Prejudice"
"impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the","Pride and Prejudice"
"other, and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did","Pride and Prejudice"
"not err. But when she read and re-read, with the closest attention, the","Pride and Prejudice"
"particulars immediately following of Wickham’s resigning all pretensions","Pride and Prejudice"
"to the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three","Pride and Prejudice"
"thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down the","Pride and Prejudice"
"letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be","Pride and Prejudice"
"impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with","Pride and Prejudice"
"little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read on.","Pride and Prejudice"
"But every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had","Pride and Prejudice"
"believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to","Pride and Prejudice"
"render Mr. Darcy’s conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a","Pride and Prejudice"
"turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Wickham’s charge exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could","Pride and Prejudice"
"bring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his","Pride and Prejudice"
"entrance into the ----shire militia, in which he had engaged at the","Pride and Prejudice"

"character she had no reason to question. At one time she had almost","Pride and Prejudice"
"resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness","Pride and Prejudice"
"of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been","Pride and Prejudice"
"well assured of his cousin’s corroboration.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation","Pride and Prejudice"
"between Wickham and herself in their first evening at Mr. Philips’s.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was _now_","Pride and Prejudice"
"struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting","Pride and Prejudice"
"himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions","Pride and Prejudice"
"with his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear","Pride and Prejudice"
"of seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that","Pride and Prejudice"
"_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball","Pride and Prejudice"
"the very next week. She remembered, also, that till the Netherfield","Pride and Prejudice"
"family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but","Pride and Prejudice"
"herself; but that after their removal, it had been everywhere discussed;","Pride and Prejudice"
"that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would","Pride and Prejudice"
"always prevent his exposing the son.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned! His","Pride and Prejudice"
"attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and","Pride and Prejudice"
"hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer","Pride and Prejudice"
"the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.","Pride and Prejudice"
"His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive: he had","Pride and Prejudice"
"either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying","Pride and Prejudice"
"his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most","Pride and Prejudice"
"incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter","Pride and Prejudice"
"and fainter; and in further justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not","Pride and Prejudice"
"but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago","Pride and Prejudice"
"asserted his blamelessness in the affair;--that, proud and repulsive as","Pride and Prejudice"
"were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their","Pride and Prejudice"
"acquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much","Pride and Prejudice"
"together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anything","Pride and Prejudice"
"that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him","Pride and Prejudice"
"of irreligious or immoral habits;--that among his own connections he was","Pride and Prejudice"
"esteemed and valued;--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a","Pride and Prejudice"
"brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his","Pride and Prejudice"
"sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling;--that had his","Pride and Prejudice"
"actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of","Pride and Prejudice"
"everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and","Pride and Prejudice"
"that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man","Pride and Prejudice"
"as Mr. Bingley was incomprehensible.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor Wickham","Pride and Prejudice"
"could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial,","Pride and Prejudice"
"prejudiced, absurd.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“How despicably have I acted!” she cried. “I, who have prided myself on","Pride and Prejudice"
"my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have","Pride and Prejudice"
"often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my","Pride and Prejudice"
"vanity in useless or blameless distrust. How humiliating is this","Pride and Prejudice"
"discovery! Yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could not","Pride and Prejudice"
"have been more wretchedly blind. But vanity, not love, has been my","Pride and Prejudice"
"folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect","Pride and Prejudice"
"of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted","Pride and Prejudice"
"prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away where either were","Pride and Prejudice"
"concerned. Till this moment, I never knew myself.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"From herself to Jane, from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line","Pride and Prejudice"
"which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy’s explanation","Pride and Prejudice"
"_there_ had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again. Widely","Pride and Prejudice"
"different was the effect of a second perusal. How could she deny that","Pride and Prejudice"
"credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to","Pride and Prejudice"
"give in the other? He declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious","Pride and Prejudice"
"of her sister’s attachment; and she could not help remembering what","Pride and Prejudice"
"Charlotte’s opinion had always been. Neither could she deny the justice","Pride and Prejudice"
"of his description of Jane. She felt that Jane’s feelings, though","Pride and Prejudice"
"fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant","Pride and Prejudice"
"complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great","Pride and Prejudice"
"sensibility.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were","Pride and Prejudice"
"mentioned, in tones of such mortifying, yet merited, reproach, her sense","Pride and Prejudice"

"for denial; and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as","Pride and Prejudice"
"having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first","Pride and Prejudice"
"disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind","Pride and Prejudice"
"than on hers.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It soothed, but","Pride and Prejudice"
"it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus","Pride and Prejudice"

"she was still full of indignation: but when she considered how unjustly","Pride and Prejudice"
"she had condemned and upbraided him, her anger was turned against","Pride and Prejudice"
"herself; and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion.","Pride and Prejudice"
"His attachment excited gratitude, his general character respect: but she","Pride and Prejudice"
"could not approve him; nor could she for a moment repent her refusal, or","Pride and Prejudice"
"feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again. In her own past","Pride and Prejudice"
"behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and regret: and in","Pride and Prejudice"
"the unhappy defects of her family, a subject of yet heavier chagrin.","Pride and Prejudice"
"They were hopeless of remedy. Her father, contented with laughing at","Pride and Prejudice"
"them, would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his","Pride and Prejudice"
"youngest daughters; and her mother, with manners so far from right","Pride and Prejudice"
"herself, was entirely insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently","Pride and Prejudice"
"united with Jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine","Pride and Prejudice"
"and Lydia; but while they were supported by their mother’s indulgence,","Pride and Prejudice"
"what chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited,","Pride and Prejudice"
"irritable, and completely under Lydia’s guidance, had been always","Pride and Prejudice"
"affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless, would","Pride and Prejudice"
"scarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and vain. While","Pride and Prejudice"
"there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt with him; and while","Pride and Prejudice"
"Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they would be going there for","Pride and Prejudice"
"ever.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Anxiety on Jane’s behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr. Darcy’s","Pride and Prejudice"

"heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His affection was proved to","Pride and Prejudice"

"could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend. How","Pride and Prejudice"
"grievous then was the thought that, of a situation so desirable in every","Pride and Prejudice"

"been deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her own family!","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"When to these recollections was added the development of Wickham’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"character, it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had","Pride and Prejudice"
"seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it","Pride and Prejudice"
"almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last week of","Pride and Prejudice"

"On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a few","Pride and Prejudice"
"minutes before the others appeared; and he took the opportunity of","Pride and Prejudice"
"paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I know not, Miss Elizabeth,” said he, “whether Mrs. Collins has yet","Pride and Prejudice"
"expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I am very","Pride and Prejudice"
"certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for","Pride and Prejudice"
"it. The favour of your company has been much felt, I assure you. We know","Pride and Prejudice"
"how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode. Our plain","Pride and Prejudice"
"manner of living, our small rooms, and few domestics, and the little we","Pride and Prejudice"
"see of the world, must make Hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like","Pride and Prejudice"
"yourself; but I hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and that we have done everything in our power to prevent you spending","Pride and Prejudice"
"your time unpleasantly.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness. She had","Pride and Prejudice"
"spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of being with","Pride and Prejudice"
"Charlotte, and the kind attention she had received, must make _her_ feel","Pride and Prejudice"
"the obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified; and with a more smiling","Pride and Prejudice"
"solemnity replied,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“It gives me the greatest pleasure to hear that you have passed your","Pride and Prejudice"
"time not disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most","Pride and Prejudice"
"fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior","Pride and Prejudice"
"society, and from our connection with Rosings, the frequent means of","Pride and Prejudice"
"varying the humble home scene, I think we may flatter ourselves that","Pride and Prejudice"
"your Hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome. Our situation","Pride and Prejudice"
"with regard to Lady Catherine’s family is, indeed, the sort of","Pride and Prejudice"
"extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast. You see on","Pride and Prejudice"
"what a footing we are. You see how continually we are engaged there. In","Pride and Prejudice"
"truth, I must acknowledge, that, with all the disadvantages of this","Pride and Prejudice"
"humble parsonage, I should not think anyone abiding in it an object of","Pride and Prejudice"
"compassion, while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings; and he was","Pride and Prejudice"
"obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to unite civility","Pride and Prejudice"
"and truth in a few short sentences.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into","Pride and Prejudice"
"Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself, at least, that you will","Pride and Prejudice"
"be able to do so. Lady Catherine’s great attentions to Mrs. Collins you","Pride and Prejudice"
"have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust it does not appear","Pride and Prejudice"
"that your friend has drawn an unfortunate--but on this point it will be","Pride and Prejudice"
"as well to be silent. Only let me assure you, my dear Miss Elizabeth,","Pride and Prejudice"
"that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in","Pride and Prejudice"
"marriage. My dear Charlotte and I have but one mind and one way of","Pride and Prejudice"
"thinking. There is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of","Pride and Prejudice"
"character and ideas between us. We seem to have been designed for each","Pride and Prejudice"
"other.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was","Pride and Prejudice"
"the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she firmly believed","Pride and Prejudice"
"and rejoiced in his domestic comforts. She was not sorry, however, to","Pride and Prejudice"
"have the recital of them interrupted by the entrance of the lady from","Pride and Prejudice"
"whom they sprang. Poor Charlotte! it was melancholy to leave her to such","Pride and Prejudice"
"society! But she had chosen it with her eyes open; and though evidently","Pride and Prejudice"
"regretting that her visitors were to go, she did not seem to ask for","Pride and Prejudice"
"compassion. Her home and her housekeeping, her parish and her poultry,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and all their dependent concerns, had not yet lost their charms.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the parcels","Pride and Prejudice"
"placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After an affectionate","Pride and Prejudice"
"parting between the friends, Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Collins; and as they walked down the garden, he was commissioning","Pride and Prejudice"
"her with his best respects to all her family, not forgetting his thanks","Pride and Prejudice"
"for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter, and his","Pride and Prejudice"
"compliments to Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He then handed","Pride and Prejudice"
"her in, Maria followed, and the door was on the point of being closed,","Pride and Prejudice"
"when he suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had","Pride and Prejudice"
"hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies of Rosings.","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth made no objection: the door was then allowed to be shut, and","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies set out","Pride and Prejudice"
"together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ----, in Hertfordshire;","Pride and Prejudice"
"and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr. Bennet’s carriage was","Pride and Prejudice"
"to meet them, they quickly perceived, in token of the coachman’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking out of a dining-room upstairs.","Pride and Prejudice"
"These two girls had been above an hour in the place, happily employed","Pride and Prejudice"
"in visiting an opposite milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"dressing a salad and cucumber.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a table set","Pride and Prejudice"
"out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords, exclaiming,","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Is not this nice? is not this an agreeable surprise?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“And we mean to treat you all,” added Lydia; “but you must lend us the","Pride and Prejudice"
"money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there.” Then showing","Pride and Prejudice"
"her purchases,--“Look here, I have bought this bonnet. I do not think it","Pride and Prejudice"
"is very pretty; but I thought I might as well buy it as not. I shall","Pride and Prejudice"
"pull it to pieces as soon as I get home, and see if I can make it up any","Pride and Prejudice"
"better.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"And when her sisters abused it as ugly, she added, with perfect","Pride and Prejudice"
"unconcern, “Oh, but there were two or three much uglier in the shop; and","Pride and Prejudice"
"when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim it with fresh, I","Pride and Prejudice"
"think it will be very tolerable. Besides, it will not much signify what","Pride and Prejudice"
"one wears this summer, after the ----shire have left Meryton, and they","Pride and Prejudice"
"are going in a fortnight.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Are they, indeed?” cried Elizabeth, with the greatest satisfaction.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want papa to","Pride and Prejudice"
"take us all there for the summer! It would be such a delicious scheme,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and I dare say would hardly cost anything at all. Mamma would like to","Pride and Prejudice"
"go, too, of all things! Only think what a miserable summer else we shall","Pride and Prejudice"
"have!”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yes,” thought Elizabeth; “_that_ would be a delightful scheme, indeed,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton and a whole","Pride and Prejudice"
"campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset already by one poor","Pride and Prejudice"
"regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of Meryton!”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Now I have got some news for you,” said Lydia, as they sat down to","Pride and Prejudice"
"table. “What do you think? It is excellent news, capital news, and about","Pride and Prejudice"
"a certain person that we all like.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told that he","Pride and Prejudice"
"need not stay. Lydia laughed, and said,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Ay, that is just like your formality and discretion. You thought the","Pride and Prejudice"
"waiter must not hear, as if he cared! I dare say he often hears worse","Pride and Prejudice"
"things said than I am going to say. But he is an ugly fellow! I am glad","Pride and Prejudice"
"he is gone. I never saw such a long chin in my life. Well, but now for","Pride and Prejudice"
"my news: it is about dear Wickham; too good for the waiter, is not it?","Pride and Prejudice"
"There is no danger of Wickham’s marrying Mary King--there’s for you! She","Pride and Prejudice"
"is gone down to her uncle at Liverpool; gone to stay. Wickham is safe.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“And Mary King is safe!” added Elizabeth; “safe from a connection","Pride and Prejudice"
"imprudent as to fortune.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“She is a great fool for going away, if she liked him.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,” said Jane.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I am sure there is not on _his_. I will answer for it, he never cared","Pride and Prejudice"
"three straws about her. Who _could_ about such a nasty little freckled","Pride and Prejudice"
"thing?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such","Pride and Prejudice"
"coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the _sentiment_","Pride and Prejudice"
"was little other than her own breast had formerly harboured and fancied","Pride and Prejudice"
"liberal!","Pride and Prejudice"

"As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was","Pride and Prejudice"
"ordered; and, after some contrivance, the whole party, with all their","Pride and Prejudice"
"boxes, workbags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition of Kitty’s and","Pride and Prejudice"
"Lydia’s purchases, were seated in it.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“How nicely we are crammed in!” cried Lydia. “I am glad I brought my","Pride and Prejudice"
"bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another band-box! Well, now","Pride and Prejudice"
"let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk and laugh all the way","Pride and Prejudice"
"home. And in the first place, let us hear what has happened to you all","Pride and Prejudice"
"since you went away. Have you seen any pleasant men? Have you had any","Pride and Prejudice"
"flirting? I was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband","Pride and Prejudice"
"before you came back. Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare.","Pride and Prejudice"
"She is almost three-and-twenty! Lord! how ashamed I should be of not","Pride and Prejudice"
"being married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Philips wants you so to","Pride and Prejudice"
"get husbands you can’t think. She says Lizzy had better have taken Mr.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any fun in it. Lord!","Pride and Prejudice"
"how I should like to be married before any of you! and then I would","Pride and Prejudice"
"_chaperon_ you about to all the balls. Dear me! we had such a good piece","Pride and Prejudice"
"of fun the other day at Colonel Forster’s! Kitty and me were to spend","Pride and Prejudice"
"the day there, and Mrs. Forster promised to have a little dance in the","Pride and Prejudice"
"evening; (by-the-bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so","Pride and Prejudice"
"she asked the two Harringtons to come: but Harriet was ill, and so Pen","Pride and Prejudice"
"was forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We","Pride and Prejudice"
"dressed up Chamberlayne in woman’s clothes, on purpose to pass for a","Pride and Prejudice"
"lady,--only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel and Mrs.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were forced to borrow","Pride and Prejudice"
"one of her gowns; and you cannot imagine how well he looked! When Denny,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or three more of the men came in, they","Pride and Prejudice"
"did not know him in the least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Forster. I thought I should have died. And _that_ made the men suspect","Pride and Prejudice"
"something, and then they soon found out what was the matter.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"With such kind of histories of their parties and good jokes did Lydia,","Pride and Prejudice"
"assisted by Kitty’s hints and additions, endeavour to amuse her","Pride and Prejudice"
"companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened as little as she","Pride and Prejudice"
"could, but there was no escaping the frequent mention of Wickham’s name.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to see Jane","Pride and Prejudice"
"in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner did Mr. Bennet","Pride and Prejudice"
"say voluntarily to Elizabeth,----","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I am glad you are come back, Lizzy.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the Lucases","Pride and Prejudice"
"came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were the subjects","Pride and Prejudice"
"which occupied them: Lady Lucas was inquiring of Maria, across the","Pride and Prejudice"
"table, after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter; Mrs. Bennet","Pride and Prejudice"
"was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of the present","Pride and Prejudice"
"fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her, and on the other,","Pride and Prejudice"
"retailing them all to the younger Miss Lucases; and Lydia, in a voice","Pride and Prejudice"
"rather louder than any other person’s, was enumerating the various","Pride and Prejudice"
"pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Oh, Mary,” said she, “I wish you had gone with us, for we had such fun!","Pride and Prejudice"
"as we went along Kitty and me drew up all the blinds, and pretended","Pride and Prejudice"
"there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone so all the way, if","Pride and Prejudice"
"Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to the George, I do think we","Pride and Prejudice"
"behaved very handsomely, for we treated the other three with the nicest","Pride and Prejudice"
"cold luncheon in the world, and if you would have gone, we would have","Pride and Prejudice"
"treated you too. And then when we came away it was such fun! I thought","Pride and Prejudice"
"we never should have got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter.","Pride and Prejudice"
"And then we were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so","Pride and Prejudice"
"loud, that anybody might have heard us ten miles off!”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"To this, Mary very gravely replied, “Far be it from me, my dear sister,","Pride and Prejudice"
"to depreciate such pleasures. They would doubtless be congenial with the","Pride and Prejudice"
"generality of female minds. But I confess they would have no charms for","Pride and Prejudice"
"_me_. I should infinitely prefer a book.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She seldom listened to","Pride and Prejudice"
"anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary at all.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to","Pride and Prejudice"
"Meryton, and see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth steadily opposed","Pride and Prejudice"
"the scheme. It should not be said, that the Miss Bennets could not be at","Pride and Prejudice"
"home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers. There was","Pride and Prejudice"
"another reason, too, for her opposition. She dreaded seeing Wickham","Pride and Prejudice"
"again, and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The comfort to","Pride and Prejudice"
"_her_, of the regiment’s approaching removal, was indeed beyond","Pride and Prejudice"
"expression. In a fortnight they were to go, and once gone, she hoped","Pride and Prejudice"
"there could be nothing more to plague her on his account.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She had not been many hours at home, before she found that the Brighton","Pride and Prejudice"
"scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn, was under","Pride and Prejudice"
"frequent discussion between her parents. Elizabeth saw directly that her","Pride and Prejudice"
"father had not the smallest intention of yielding; but his answers were","Pride and Prejudice"
"at the same time so vague and equivocal, that her mother, though often","Pride and Prejudice"
"disheartened, had never yet despaired of succeeding at last.","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Miss Bennet’s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly","Pride and Prejudice"

"natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings. She was","Pride and Prejudice"
"sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so","Pride and Prejudice"
"little suited to recommend them; but still more was she grieved for the","Pride and Prejudice"
"unhappiness which her sister’s refusal must have given him.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“His being so sure of succeeding was wrong,” said she, “and certainly","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“But you _will_ know it, when I have told you what happened the very","Pride and Prejudice"
"next day.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents as far","Pride and Prejudice"
"as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this for poor Jane,","Pride and Prejudice"
"who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that","Pride and Prejudice"
"so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here","Pride and Prejudice"
"collected in one individual! Nor was Darcy’s vindication, though","Pride and Prejudice"
"grateful to her feelings, capable of consoling her for such discovery.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"seek to clear one, without involving the other.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“This will not do,” said Elizabeth; “you never will be able to make both","Pride and Prejudice"
"of them good for anything. Take your choice, but you must be satisfied","Pride and Prejudice"
"with only one. There is but such a quantity of merit between them; just","Pride and Prejudice"
"enough to make one good sort of man; and of late it has been shifting","Pride and Prejudice"
"about pretty much. For my part, I am inclined to believe it all Mr.","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorized me to","Pride and Prejudice"

"lurking behind, of which prudence forbade the disclosure. She dared not","Pride and Prejudice"
"relate the other half of Mr. Darcy’s letter, nor explain to her sister","Pride and Prejudice"
"how sincerely she had been valued by his friend. Here was knowledge in","Pride and Prejudice"
"which no one could partake; and she was sensible that nothing less than","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began. It was","Pride and Prejudice"
"the last of the regiment’s stay in Meryton, and all the young ladies in","Pride and Prejudice"
"the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The dejection was almost","Pride and Prejudice"
"universal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were still able to eat, drink,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and sleep, and pursue the usual course of their employments. Very","Pride and Prejudice"
"frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by Kitty and","Pride and Prejudice"
"Lydia, whose own misery was extreme, and who could not comprehend such","Pride and Prejudice"
"hard-heartedness in any of the family.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Good Heaven! What is to become of us? What are we to do?” would they","Pride and Prejudice"
"often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. “How can you be smiling so,","Pride and Prejudice"
"Lizzy?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she remembered what","Pride and Prejudice"
"she had herself endured on a similar occasion five-and-twenty years ago.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I am sure,” said she, “I cried for two days together when Colonel","Pride and Prejudice"
"Miller’s regiment went away. I thought I should have broke my heart.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I am sure I shall break _mine_,” said Lydia.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“If one could but go to Brighton!” observed Mrs. Bennet.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Oh yes!--if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so disagreeable.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“A little sea-bathing would set me up for ever.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“And my aunt Philips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of good,”","Pride and Prejudice"
"added Kitty.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through","Pride and Prejudice"
"Longbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all sense","Pride and Prejudice"
"of pleasure was lost in shame. She felt anew the justice of Mr. Darcy’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"objections; and never had she before been so much disposed to pardon his","Pride and Prejudice"
"interference in the views of his friend.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"But the gloom of Lydia’s prospect was shortly cleared away; for she","Pride and Prejudice"
"received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the colonel of the","Pride and Prejudice"
"regiment, to accompany her to Brighton. This invaluable friend was a","Pride and Prejudice"
"very young woman, and very lately married. A resemblance in good-humour","Pride and Prejudice"
"and good spirits had recommended her and Lydia to each other, and out of","Pride and Prejudice"
"their _three_ months’ acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her adoration of Mrs. Forster,","Pride and Prejudice"
"the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of Kitty, are scarcely","Pride and Prejudice"
"to be described. Wholly inattentive to her sister’s feelings, Lydia flew","Pride and Prejudice"
"about the house in restless ecstasy, calling for everyone’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"congratulations, and laughing and talking with more violence than ever;","Pride and Prejudice"
"whilst the luckless Kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate","Pride and Prejudice"
"in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as Lydia,”","Pride and Prejudice"
"said she, “though I am _not_ her particular friend. I have just as much","Pride and Prejudice"
"right to be asked as she has, and more too, for I am two years older.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable, and Jane to make","Pride and Prejudice"
"her resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was so far from","Pride and Prejudice"
"exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and Lydia, that she","Pride and Prejudice"
"considered it as the death-warrant of all possibility of common sense","Pride and Prejudice"
"for the latter; and detestable as such a step must make her, were it","Pride and Prejudice"
"known, she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her","Pride and Prejudice"
"go. She represented to him all the improprieties of Lydia’s general","Pride and Prejudice"
"behaviour, the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of","Pride and Prejudice"
"such a woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her being yet more","Pride and Prejudice"
"imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the temptations must","Pride and Prejudice"
"be greater than at home. He heard her attentively, and then said,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public","Pride and Prejudice"
"place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little","Pride and Prejudice"
"expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present","Pride and Prejudice"
"circumstances.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“If you were aware,” said Elizabeth, “of the very great disadvantage to","Pride and Prejudice"
"us all, which must arise from the public notice of Lydia’s unguarded and","Pride and Prejudice"
"imprudent manner, nay, which has already arisen from it, I am sure you","Pride and Prejudice"
"would judge differently in the affair.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Already arisen!” repeated Mr. Bennet. “What! has she frightened away","Pride and Prejudice"
"some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast down. Such","Pride and Prejudice"
"squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity","Pride and Prejudice"
"are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the list of the pitiful fellows","Pride and Prejudice"
"who have been kept aloof by Lydia’s folly.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Indeed, you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It is not","Pride and Prejudice"
"of peculiar, but of general evils, which I am now complaining. Our","Pride and Prejudice"
"importance, our respectability in the world, must be affected by the","Pride and Prejudice"
"wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark","Pride and Prejudice"
"Lydia’s character. Excuse me,--for I must speak plainly. If you, my dear","Pride and Prejudice"
"father, will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of","Pride and Prejudice"
"her life, she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her character","Pride and Prejudice"
"will be fixed; and she will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt","Pride and Prejudice"
"that ever made herself and her family ridiculous;--a flirt, too, in the","Pride and Prejudice"
"worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any attraction beyond","Pride and Prejudice"
"youth and a tolerable person; and, from the ignorance and emptiness of","Pride and Prejudice"
"her mind, wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal","Pride and Prejudice"
"contempt which her rage for admiration will excite. In this danger Kitty","Pride and Prejudice"
"is also comprehended. She will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain,","Pride and Prejudice"
"ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh, my dear father, can you","Pride and Prejudice"
"suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever","Pride and Prejudice"
"they are known, and that their sisters will not be often involved in the","Pride and Prejudice"
"disgrace?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Bennet saw that her whole heart was in the subject; and,","Pride and Prejudice"
"affectionately taking her hand, said, in reply,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are known,","Pride and Prejudice"
"you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear to less","Pride and Prejudice"
"advantage for having a couple of--or I may say, three--very silly","Pride and Prejudice"
"sisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does not go to","Pride and Prejudice"
"Brighton. Let her go, then. Colonel Forster is a sensible man, and will","Pride and Prejudice"
"keep her out of any real mischief; and she is luckily too poor to be an","Pride and Prejudice"
"object of prey to anybody. At Brighton she will be of less importance","Pride and Prejudice"
"even as a common flirt than she has been here. The officers will find","Pride and Prejudice"
"women better worth their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her being","Pride and Prejudice"
"there may teach her her own insignificance. At any rate, she cannot grow","Pride and Prejudice"
"many degrees worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest","Pride and Prejudice"
"of her life.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her own opinion","Pride and Prejudice"
"continued the same, and she left him disappointed and sorry. It was not","Pride and Prejudice"
"in her nature, however, to increase her vexations by dwelling on them.","Pride and Prejudice"
"She was confident of having performed her duty; and to fret over","Pride and Prejudice"
"unavoidable evils, or augment them by anxiety, was no part of her","Pride and Prejudice"
"disposition.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Had Lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her","Pride and Prejudice"
"father, their indignation would hardly have found expression in their","Pride and Prejudice"
"united volubility. In Lydia’s imagination, a visit to Brighton comprised","Pride and Prejudice"
"every possibility of earthly happiness. She saw, with the creative eye","Pride and Prejudice"
"of fancy, the streets of that gay bathing-place covered with officers.","Pride and Prejudice"
"She saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at","Pride and Prejudice"
"present unknown. She saw all the glories of the camp: its tents","Pride and Prejudice"
"stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young","Pride and Prejudice"
"and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the view, she","Pride and Prejudice"
"saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting with at least six","Pride and Prejudice"
"officers at once.","Pride and Prejudice"

"Had she known that her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and","Pride and Prejudice"
"such realities as these, what would have been her sensations? They could","Pride and Prejudice"
"have been understood only by her mother, who might have felt nearly the","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their raptures","Pride and Prejudice"

"home.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having been","Pride and Prejudice"
"frequently in company with him since her return, agitation was pretty","Pride and Prejudice"
"well over; the agitations of former partiality entirely so. She had even","Pride and Prejudice"
"learnt to detect, in the very gentleness which had first delighted her,","Pride and Prejudice"
"an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary. In his present","Pride and Prejudice"
"behaviour to herself, moreover, she had a fresh source of displeasure;","Pride and Prejudice"
"for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those attentions which","Pride and Prejudice"
"had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve, after","Pride and Prejudice"
"what had since passed, to provoke her. She lost all concern for him in","Pride and Prejudice"
"finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous","Pride and Prejudice"
"gallantry; and while she steadily repressed it, could not but feel the","Pride and Prejudice"
"reproof contained in his believing, that however long, and for whatever","Pride and Prejudice"
"cause, his attentions had been withdrawn, her vanity would be gratified,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and her preference secured, at any time, by their renewal.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"On the very last day of the regiment’s remaining in Meryton, he dined,","Pride and Prejudice"
"with others of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little was Elizabeth","Pride and Prejudice"
"disposed to part from him in good-humour, that, on his making some","Pride and Prejudice"
"inquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at Hunsford, she","Pride and Prejudice"
"mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam’s and Mr. Darcy’s having both spent three","Pride and Prejudice"
"weeks at Rosings, and asked him if he were acquainted with the former.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"He looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but, with a moment’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"recollection, and a returning smile, replied, that he had formerly seen","Pride and Prejudice"
"him often; and, after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man,","Pride and Prejudice"
"asked her how she had liked him. Her answer was warmly in his favour.","Pride and Prejudice"
"With an air of indifference, he soon afterwards added, “How long did you","Pride and Prejudice"
"say that he was at Rosings?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Nearly three weeks.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“And you saw him frequently?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yes, almost every day.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“His manners are very different from his cousin’s.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yes, very different; but I think Mr. Darcy improves on acquaintance.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Indeed!” cried Wickham, with a look which did not escape her. “And pray","Pride and Prejudice"
"may I ask--” but checking himself, he added, in a gayer tone, “Is it in","Pride and Prejudice"
"address that he improves? Has he deigned to add aught of civility to his","Pride and Prejudice"
"ordinary style? for I dare not hope,” he continued, in a lower and more","Pride and Prejudice"
"serious tone, “that he is improved in essentials.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Oh, no!” said Elizabeth. “In essentials, I believe, he is very much","Pride and Prejudice"
"what he ever was.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"While she spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to","Pride and Prejudice"
"rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning. There was a","Pride and Prejudice"
"something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive","Pride and Prejudice"
"and anxious attention, while she added,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“When I said that he improved on acquaintance, I did not mean that","Pride and Prejudice"
"either his mind or manners were in a state of improvement; but that,","Pride and Prejudice"
"from knowing him better, his disposition was better understood.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Wickham’s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated","Pride and Prejudice"
"look; for a few minutes he was silent; till, shaking off his","Pride and Prejudice"
"embarrassment, he turned to her again, and said in the gentlest of","Pride and Prejudice"
"accents,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You, who so well know my feelings towards Mr. Darcy, will readily","Pride and Prejudice"
"comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume","Pride and Prejudice"
"even the _appearance_ of what is right. His pride, in that direction,","Pride and Prejudice"
"may be of service, if not to himself, to many others, for it must deter","Pride and Prejudice"
"him from such foul misconduct as I have suffered by. I only fear that","Pride and Prejudice"
"the sort of cautiousness to which you, I imagine, have been alluding, is","Pride and Prejudice"
"merely adopted on his visits to his aunt, of whose good opinion and","Pride and Prejudice"
"judgment he stands much in awe. His fear of her has always operated, I","Pride and Prejudice"
"know, when they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his","Pride and Prejudice"
"wish of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I am certain he","Pride and Prejudice"
"has very much at heart.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she answered only by a","Pride and Prejudice"
"slight inclination of the head. She saw that he wanted to engage her on","Pride and Prejudice"
"the old subject of his grievances, and she was in no humour to indulge","Pride and Prejudice"
"him. The rest of the evening passed with the _appearance_, on his side,","Pride and Prejudice"

"Had Elizabeth’s opinion been all drawn from her own family, she could","Pride and Prejudice"

"disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own","Pride and Prejudice"
"imprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often","Pride and Prejudice"
"console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He was fond of","Pride and Prejudice"

"them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle; and, though Kitty","Pride and Prejudice"
"might in time regain her natural degree of sense, since the disturbers","Pride and Prejudice"
"of her brain were removed, her other sister, from whose disposition","Pride and Prejudice"
"greater evil might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her","Pride and Prejudice"
"folly and assurance, by a situation of such double danger as a","Pride and Prejudice"
"watering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she found, what","Pride and Prejudice"
"has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she had looked","Pride and Prejudice"
"forward with impatient desire, did not, in taking place, bring all the","Pride and Prejudice"
"satisfaction she had promised herself. It was consequently necessary to","Pride and Prejudice"
"name some other period for the commencement of actual felicity; to have","Pride and Prejudice"
"some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by","Pride and Prejudice"
"again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the","Pride and Prejudice"
"present, and prepare for another disappointment. Her tour to the Lakes","Pride and Prejudice"
"was now the object of her happiest thoughts: it was her best consolation","Pride and Prejudice"
"for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother","Pride and Prejudice"
"and Kitty made inevitable; and could she have included Jane in the","Pride and Prejudice"
"scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“But it is fortunate,” thought she, “that I have something to wish for.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment would be certain.","Pride and Prejudice"
"But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my","Pride and Prejudice"
"sister’s absence, I may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of","Pride and Prejudice"
"pleasure realized. A scheme of which every part promises delight can","Pride and Prejudice"
"never be successful; and general disappointment is only warded off by","Pride and Prejudice"
"the defence of some little peculiar vexation.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"When Lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely","Pride and Prejudice"
"to her mother and Kitty; but her letters were always long expected, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"always very short. Those to her mother contained little else than that","Pride and Prejudice"
"they were just returned from the library, where such and such officers","Pride and Prejudice"
"had attended them, and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as","Pride and Prejudice"
"made her quite wild; that she had a new gown, or a new parasol, which","Pride and Prejudice"
"she would have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a","Pride and Prejudice"
"violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her, and they were going to the","Pride and Prejudice"
"camp; and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less","Pride and Prejudice"
"to be learnt, for her letters to Kitty, though rather longer, were much","Pride and Prejudice"
"too full of lines under the words to be made public.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"After the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence, health,","Pride and Prejudice"
"good-humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn. Everything","Pride and Prejudice"
"wore a happier aspect. The families who had been in town for the winter","Pride and Prejudice"
"came back again, and summer finery and summer engagements arose. Mrs.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity; and by the middle","Pride and Prejudice"
"of June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton","Pride and Prejudice"
"without tears,--an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth","Pride and Prejudice"
"hope, that by the following Christmas she might be so tolerably","Pride and Prejudice"
"reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by","Pride and Prejudice"
"some cruel and malicious arrangement at the War Office, another regiment","Pride and Prejudice"
"should be quartered in Meryton.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast","Pride and Prejudice"
"approaching; and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a letter","Pride and Prejudice"
"arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its commencement and","Pride and Prejudice"
"curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be prevented by business from","Pride and Prejudice"
"setting out till a fortnight later in July, and must be in London again","Pride and Prejudice"
"within a month; and as that left too short a period for them to go so","Pride and Prejudice"
"far, and see so much as they had proposed, or at least to see it with","Pride and Prejudice"
"the leisure and comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up","Pride and Prejudice"
"the Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour; and, according to the","Pride and Prejudice"
"present plan, were to go no farther northward than Derbyshire. In that","Pride and Prejudice"
"county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three","Pride and Prejudice"
"weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction. The","Pride and Prejudice"
"town where she had formerly passed some years of her life, and where","Pride and Prejudice"
"they were now to spend a few days, was probably as great an object of","Pride and Prejudice"
"her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth,","Pride and Prejudice"
"Dovedale, or the Peak.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth was excessively disappointed: she had set her heart on seeing","Pride and Prejudice"
"the Lakes; and still thought there might have been time enough. But it","Pride and Prejudice"
"was her business to be satisfied--and certainly her temper to be happy;","Pride and Prejudice"
"and all was soon right again.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"With the mention of Derbyshire, there were many ideas connected. It was","Pride and Prejudice"
"impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its","Pride and Prejudice"
"owner. “But surely,” said she, “I may enter his county with impunity,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and rob it of a few petrified spars, without his perceiving me.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to pass away","Pride and Prejudice"
"before her uncle and aunt’s arrival. But they did pass away, and Mr. and","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at length appear at","Pride and Prejudice"
"Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and eight years old, and two","Pride and Prejudice"
"younger boys, were to be left under the particular care of their cousin","Pride and Prejudice"
"Jane, who was the general favourite, and whose steady sense and","Pride and Prejudice"
"sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every","Pride and Prejudice"
"way--teaching them, playing with them, and loving them.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the next","Pride and Prejudice"
"morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement. One","Pride and Prejudice"
"enjoyment was certain--that of suitableness as companions; a","Pride and Prejudice"
"suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear","Pride and Prejudice"
"inconveniences--cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure--and affection","Pride and Prejudice"
"and intelligence, which might supply it among themselves if there were","Pride and Prejudice"
"disappointments abroad.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"It is not the object of this work to give a description of Derbyshire,","Pride and Prejudice"
"nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither","Pride and Prejudice"
"lay--Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth, Birmingham, etc., are","Pride and Prejudice"
"sufficiently known. A small part of Derbyshire is all the present","Pride and Prejudice"
"concern. To the little town of Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"former residence, and where she had lately learned that some","Pride and Prejudice"
"acquaintance still remained, they bent their steps, after having seen","Pride and Prejudice"
"all the principal wonders of the country; and within five miles of","Pride and Prejudice"
"Lambton, Elizabeth found, from her aunt, that Pemberley was situated. It","Pride and Prejudice"
"was not in their direct road; nor more than a mile or two out of it. In","Pride and Prejudice"
"talking over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an","Pride and Prejudice"
"inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his","Pride and Prejudice"
"willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so","Pride and Prejudice"
"much?” said her aunt. “A place, too, with which so many of your","Pride and Prejudice"
"acquaintance are connected. Wickham passed all his youth there, you","Pride and Prejudice"
"know.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth was distressed. She felt that she had no business at","Pride and Prejudice"
"Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it. She","Pride and Prejudice"
"must own that she was tired of great houses: after going over so many,","Pride and Prejudice"
"she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mrs. Gardiner abused her stupidity. “If it were merely a fine house","Pride and Prejudice"
"richly furnished,” said she, “I should not care about it myself; but the","Pride and Prejudice"
"grounds are delightful. They have some of the finest woods in the","Pride and Prejudice"
"country.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth said no more; but her mind could not acquiesce. The","Pride and Prejudice"
"possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place, instantly","Pride and Prejudice"
"occurred. It would be dreadful! She blushed at the very idea; and","Pride and Prejudice"
"thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt, than to run such","Pride and Prejudice"
"a risk. But against this there were objections; and she finally resolved","Pride and Prejudice"
"that it could be the last resource, if her private inquiries as to the","Pride and Prejudice"
"absence of the family were unfavourably answered.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Accordingly, when she retired at night, she asked the chambermaid","Pride and Prejudice"
"whether Pemberley were not a very fine place, what was the name of its","Pride and Prejudice"
"proprietor, and, with no little alarm, whether the family were down for","Pride and Prejudice"
"the summer? A most welcome negative followed the last question; and her","Pride and Prejudice"
"alarms being now removed, she was at leisure to feel a great deal of","Pride and Prejudice"
"curiosity to see the house herself; and when the subject was revived the","Pride and Prejudice"
"next morning, and she was again applied to, could readily answer, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"with a proper air of indifference, that she had not really any dislike","Pride and Prejudice"
"to the scheme.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"[Illustration]","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance of","Pride and Prejudice"
"Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length they turned","Pride and Prejudice"
"in at the lodge, her spirits were in a high flutter.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground. They","Pride and Prejudice"
"entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some time through","Pride and Prejudice"
"a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth’s mind was too full for conversation, but she saw and admired","Pride and Prejudice"
"every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually ascended for","Pride and Prejudice"
"half a mile, and then found themselves at the top of a considerable","Pride and Prejudice"
"eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was instantly caught by","Pride and Prejudice"
"Pemberley House, situated on the opposite side of the valley, into which","Pride and Prejudice"
"the road with some abruptness wound. It was a large, handsome stone","Pride and Prejudice"
"building, standing well on rising ground, and backed by a ridge of high","Pride and Prejudice"
"woody hills; and in front a stream of some natural importance was","Pride and Prejudice"
"swelled into greater, but without any artificial appearance. Its banks","Pride and Prejudice"
"were neither formal nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She","Pride and Prejudice"
"had never seen a place for which nature had done more, or where natural","Pride and Prejudice"
"beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were","Pride and Prejudice"
"all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she felt that","Pride and Prejudice"
"to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the door; and,","Pride and Prejudice"
"while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all her apprehension of","Pride and Prejudice"
"meeting its owner returned. She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been","Pride and Prejudice"
"mistaken. On applying to see the place, they were admitted into the","Pride and Prejudice"
"hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited for the housekeeper, had leisure to","Pride and Prejudice"
"wonder at her being where she was.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The housekeeper came; a respectable looking elderly woman, much less","Pride and Prejudice"
"fine, and more civil, than she had any notion of finding her. They","Pride and Prejudice"
"followed her into the dining-parlour. It was a large, well-proportioned","Pride and Prejudice"
"room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after slightly surveying it, went","Pride and Prejudice"
"to a window to enjoy its prospect. The hill, crowned with wood, from","Pride and Prejudice"
"which they had descended, receiving increased abruptness from the","Pride and Prejudice"
"distance, was a beautiful object. Every disposition of the ground was","Pride and Prejudice"
"good; and she looked on the whole scene, the river, the trees scattered","Pride and Prejudice"
"on its banks, and the winding of the valley, as far as she could trace","Pride and Prejudice"
"it, with delight. As they passed into other rooms, these objects were","Pride and Prejudice"
"taking different positions; but from every window there were beauties","Pride and Prejudice"
"to be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their furniture","Pride and Prejudice"
"suitable to the fortune of their proprietor; but Elizabeth saw, with","Pride and Prejudice"
"admiration of his taste, that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly","Pride and Prejudice"
"fine,--with less of splendour, and more real elegance, than the","Pride and Prejudice"
"furniture of Rosings.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“And of this place,” thought she, “I might have been mistress! With","Pride and Prejudice"
"these rooms I might have now been familiarly acquainted! Instead of","Pride and Prejudice"
"viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in them as my own, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt. But, no,” recollecting","Pride and Prejudice"
"herself, “that could never be; my uncle and aunt would have been lost to","Pride and Prejudice"
"me; I should not have been allowed to invite them.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"This was a lucky recollection--it saved her from something like regret.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She longed to inquire of the housekeeper whether her master were really","Pride and Prejudice"
"absent, but had not courage for it. At length, however, the question was","Pride and Prejudice"
"asked by her uncle; and she turned away with alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds","Pride and Prejudice"
"replied, that he was; adding, “But we expect him to-morrow, with a large","Pride and Prejudice"
"party of friends.” How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had","Pride and Prejudice"
"not by any circumstance been delayed a day!","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Her aunt now called her to look at a picture. She approached, and saw","Pride and Prejudice"
"the likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other","Pride and Prejudice"
"miniatures, over the mantel-piece. Her aunt asked her, smilingly, how","Pride and Prejudice"
"she liked it. The housekeeper came forward, and told them it was the","Pride and Prejudice"
"picture of a young gentleman, the son of her late master’s steward, who","Pride and Prejudice"
"had been brought up by him at his own expense. “He is now gone into the","Pride and Prejudice"
"army,” she added; “but I am afraid he has turned out very wild.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile, but Elizabeth could not","Pride and Prejudice"
"return it.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“And that,” said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the miniatures,","Pride and Prejudice"
"“is my master--and very like him. It was drawn at the same time as the","Pride and Prejudice"
"other--about eight years ago.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I have heard much of your master’s fine person,” said Mrs. Gardiner,","Pride and Prejudice"
"looking at the picture; “it is a handsome face. But, Lizzy, you can tell","Pride and Prejudice"
"us whether it is like or not.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mrs. Reynolds’ respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this","Pride and Prejudice"
"intimation of her knowing her master.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth coloured, and said, “A little.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“And do not you think him a very handsome gentleman, ma’am?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yes, very handsome.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery upstairs you","Pride and Prejudice"
"will see a finer, larger picture of him than this. This room was my late","Pride and Prejudice"
"master’s favourite room, and these miniatures are just as they used to","Pride and Prejudice"
"be then. He was very fond of them.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham’s being among them.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy, drawn","Pride and Prejudice"
"when she was only eight years old.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her brother?” said Mr. Gardiner.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Oh, yes--the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so","Pride and Prejudice"
"accomplished! She plays and sings all day long. In the next room is a","Pride and Prejudice"
"new instrument just come down for her--a present from my master: she","Pride and Prejudice"
"comes here to-morrow with him.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were easy and pleasant, encouraged her","Pride and Prejudice"
"communicativeness by his questions and remarks: Mrs. Reynolds, either","Pride and Prejudice"
"from pride or attachment, had evidently great pleasure in talking of her","Pride and Prejudice"
"master and his sister.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Not so much as I could wish, sir: but I dare say he may spend half his","Pride and Prejudice"
"time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer months.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Except,” thought Elizabeth, “when she goes to Ramsgate.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“If your master would marry, you might see more of him.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know who is","Pride and Prejudice"
"good enough for him.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying, “It is","Pride and Prejudice"
"very much to his credit, I am sure, that you should think so.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I say no more than the truth, and what everybody will say that knows","Pride and Prejudice"
"him,” replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far;","Pride and Prejudice"
"and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added,","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I have never had a cross word from him in my life, and I have known him","Pride and Prejudice"
"ever since he was four years old.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"This was praise of all others most extraordinary, most opposite to her","Pride and Prejudice"
"ideas. That he was not a good-tempered man had been her firmest opinion.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Her keenest attention was awakened: she longed to hear more; and was","Pride and Prejudice"
"grateful to her uncle for saying,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are lucky in","Pride and Prejudice"
"having such a master.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I could not","Pride and Prejudice"
"meet with a better. But I have always observed, that they who are","Pride and Prejudice"
"good-natured when children, are good-natured when they grow up; and he","Pride and Prejudice"
"was always the sweetest tempered, most generous-hearted boy in the","Pride and Prejudice"
"world.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth almost stared at her. “Can this be Mr. Darcy?” thought she.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“His father was an excellent man,” said Mrs. Gardiner.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yes, ma’am, that he was indeed; and his son will be just like him--just","Pride and Prejudice"
"as affable to the poor.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for more. Mrs.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Reynolds could interest her on no other point. She related the subjects","Pride and Prejudice"
"of the pictures, the dimensions of the rooms, and the price of the","Pride and Prejudice"
"furniture in vain. Mr. Gardiner, highly amused by the kind of family","Pride and Prejudice"
"prejudice, to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her","Pride and Prejudice"
"master, soon led again to the subject; and she dwelt with energy on his","Pride and Prejudice"
"many merits, as they proceeded together up the great staircase.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“He is the best landlord, and the best master,” said she, “that ever","Pride and Prejudice"
"lived. Not like the wild young men now-a-days, who think of nothing but","Pride and Prejudice"
"themselves. There is not one of his tenants or servants but what will","Pride and Prejudice"
"give him a good name. Some people call him proud; but I am sure I never","Pride and Prejudice"
"saw anything of it. To my fancy, it is only because he does not rattle","Pride and Prejudice"
"away like other young men.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“In what an amiable light does this place him!” thought Elizabeth.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“This fine account of him,” whispered her aunt as they walked, “is not","Pride and Prejudice"
"quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Perhaps we might be deceived.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“That is not very likely; our authority was too good.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"On reaching the spacious lobby above, they were shown into a very pretty","Pride and Prejudice"
"sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than","Pride and Prejudice"
"the apartments below; and were informed that it was but just done to","Pride and Prejudice"
"give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a liking to the room, when","Pride and Prejudice"
"last at Pemberley.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“He is certainly a good brother,” said Elizabeth, as she walked towards","Pride and Prejudice"
"one of the windows.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy’s delight, when she should enter","Pride and Prejudice"
"the room. “And this is always the way with him,” she added. “Whatever","Pride and Prejudice"
"can give his sister any pleasure, is sure to be done in a moment. There","Pride and Prejudice"
"is nothing he would not do for her.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The picture gallery, and two or three of the principal bed-rooms, were","Pride and Prejudice"
"all that remained to be shown. In the former were many good paintings:","Pride and Prejudice"
"but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such as had been already","Pride and Prejudice"
"visible below, she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss","Pride and Prejudice"
"Darcy’s, in crayons, whose subjects were usually more interesting, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"also more intelligible.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could have","Pride and Prejudice"
"little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked on in quest","Pride and Prejudice"
"of the only face whose features would be known to her. At last it","Pride and Prejudice"
"arrested her--and she beheld a striking resemblance of Mr. Darcy, with","Pride and Prejudice"
"such a smile over the face, as she remembered to have sometimes seen,","Pride and Prejudice"
"when he looked at her. She stood several minutes before the picture, in","Pride and Prejudice"
"earnest contemplation, and returned to it again before they quitted the","Pride and Prejudice"
"gallery. Mrs. Reynolds informed them, that it had been taken in his","Pride and Prejudice"
"father’s lifetime.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth’s mind, a more gentle","Pride and Prejudice"
"sensation towards the original than she had ever felt in the height of","Pride and Prejudice"
"their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on him by Mrs. Reynolds","Pride and Prejudice"
"was of no trifling nature. What praise is more valuable than the praise","Pride and Prejudice"
"of an intelligent servant? As a brother, a landlord, a master, she","Pride and Prejudice"
"considered how many people’s happiness were in his guardianship! How","Pride and Prejudice"
"much of pleasure or pain it was in his power to bestow! How much of good","Pride and Prejudice"
"or evil must be done by him! Every idea that had been brought forward by","Pride and Prejudice"
"the housekeeper was favourable to his character; and as she stood before","Pride and Prejudice"
"the canvas, on which he was represented, and fixed his eyes upon","Pride and Prejudice"
"herself, she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude","Pride and Prejudice"
"than it had ever raised before: she remembered its warmth, and softened","Pride and Prejudice"
"its impropriety of expression.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"When all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen,","Pride and Prejudice"
"they returned down stairs; and, taking leave of the housekeeper, were","Pride and Prejudice"
"consigned over to the gardener, who met them at the hall door.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"As they walked across the lawn towards the river, Elizabeth turned back","Pride and Prejudice"
"to look again; her uncle and aunt stopped also; and while the former was","Pride and Prejudice"
"conjecturing as to the date of the building, the owner of it himself","Pride and Prejudice"
"suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"They were within twenty yards of each other; and so abrupt was his","Pride and Prejudice"
"appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his sight. Their eyes","Pride and Prejudice"
"instantly met, and the cheeks of each were overspread with the deepest","Pride and Prejudice"
"blush. He absolutely started, and for a moment seemed immovable from","Pride and Prejudice"
"surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced towards the party,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of perfect composure, at least","Pride and Prejudice"
"of perfect civility.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his approach,","Pride and Prejudice"
"received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be","Pride and Prejudice"
"overcome. Had his first appearance, or his resemblance to the picture","Pride and Prejudice"
"they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure the other two","Pride and Prejudice"
"that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener’s expression of surprise, on","Pride and Prejudice"
"beholding his master, must immediately have told it. They stood a little","Pride and Prejudice"
"aloof while he was talking to their niece, who, astonished and confused,","Pride and Prejudice"
"scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face, and knew not what answer she","Pride and Prejudice"
"returned to his civil inquiries after her family. Amazed at the","Pride and Prejudice"
"alteration of his manner since they last parted, every sentence that he","Pride and Prejudice"
"uttered was increasing her embarrassment; and every idea of the","Pride and Prejudice"
"impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind, the few","Pride and Prejudice"
"minutes in which they continued together were some of the most","Pride and Prejudice"
"uncomfortable of her life. Nor did he seem much more at ease; when he","Pride and Prejudice"
"spoke, his accent had none of its usual sedateness; and he repeated his","Pride and Prejudice"
"inquiries as to the time of her having left Longbourn, and of her stay","Pride and Prejudice"
"in Derbyshire, so often, and in so hurried a way, as plainly spoke the","Pride and Prejudice"
"distraction of his thoughts.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"At length, every idea seemed to fail him; and after standing a few","Pride and Prejudice"
"moments without saying a word, he suddenly recollected himself, and took","Pride and Prejudice"
"leave.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The others then joined her, and expressed their admiration of his","Pride and Prejudice"
"figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and, wholly engrossed by her own","Pride and Prejudice"
"feelings, followed them in silence. She was overpowered by shame and","Pride and Prejudice"
"vexation. Her coming there was the most unfortunate, the most ill-judged","Pride and Prejudice"
"thing in the world! How strange must it appear to him! In what a","Pride and Prejudice"
"disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man! It might seem as if","Pride and Prejudice"
"she had purposely thrown herself in his way again! Oh! why did she come?","Pride and Prejudice"
"or, why did he thus come a day before he was expected? Had they been","Pride and Prejudice"
"only ten minutes sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his","Pride and Prejudice"
"discrimination; for it was plain that he was that moment arrived, that","Pride and Prejudice"
"moment alighted from his horse or his carriage. She blushed again and","Pride and Prejudice"
"again over the perverseness of the meeting. And his behaviour, so","Pride and Prejudice"
"strikingly altered,--what could it mean? That he should even speak to","Pride and Prejudice"
"her was amazing!--but to speak with such civility, to inquire after her","Pride and Prejudice"
"family! Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified,","Pride and Prejudice"
"never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting.","Pride and Prejudice"
"What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park, when","Pride and Prejudice"
"he put his letter into her hand! She knew not what to think, or how to","Pride and Prejudice"
"account for it.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a finer","Pride and Prejudice"
"reach of the woods to which they were approaching: but it was some time","Pride and Prejudice"
"before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and, though she answered","Pride and Prejudice"
"mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt, and seemed","Pride and Prejudice"
"to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out, she","Pride and Prejudice"
"distinguished no part of the scene. Her thoughts were all fixed on that","Pride and Prejudice"
"one spot of Pemberley House, whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then","Pride and Prejudice"
"was. She longed to know what at that moment was passing in his mind; in","Pride and Prejudice"
"what manner he thought of her, and whether, in defiance of everything,","Pride and Prejudice"
"she was still dear to him. Perhaps he had been civil only because he","Pride and Prejudice"
"felt himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his voice, which was","Pride and Prejudice"
"not like ease. Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing","Pride and Prejudice"
"her, she could not tell, but he certainly had not seen her with","Pride and Prejudice"
"composure.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"At length, however, the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind","Pride and Prejudice"
"roused her, and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"They entered the woods, and, bidding adieu to the river for a while,","Pride and Prejudice"
"ascended some of the higher grounds; whence, in spots where the opening","Pride and Prejudice"
"of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many charming views of","Pride and Prejudice"
"the valley, the opposite hills, with the long range of woods","Pride and Prejudice"
"overspreading many, and occasionally part of the stream. Mr. Gardiner","Pride and Prejudice"
"expressed a wish of going round the whole park, but feared it might be","Pride and Prejudice"
"beyond a walk. With a triumphant smile, they were told, that it was ten","Pride and Prejudice"
"miles round. It settled the matter; and they pursued the accustomed","Pride and Prejudice"
"circuit; which brought them again, after some time, in a descent among","Pride and Prejudice"
"hanging woods, to the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts.","Pride and Prejudice"
"They crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air of","Pride and Prejudice"
"the scene: it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited; and","Pride and Prejudice"
"the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed room only for the","Pride and Prejudice"
"stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppice-wood which bordered","Pride and Prejudice"
"it. Elizabeth longed to explore its windings; but when they had crossed","Pride and Prejudice"
"the bridge, and perceived their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner,","Pride and Prejudice"
"who was not a great walker, could go no farther, and thought only of","Pride and Prejudice"
"returning to the carriage as quickly as possible. Her niece was,","Pride and Prejudice"
"therefore, obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house","Pride and Prejudice"
"on the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but their","Pride and Prejudice"
"progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to indulge the","Pride and Prejudice"
"taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much engaged in watching the","Pride and Prejudice"
"occasional appearance of some trout in the water, and talking to the man","Pride and Prejudice"
"about them, that he advanced but little. Whilst wandering on in this","Pride and Prejudice"
"slow manner, they were again surprised, and Elizabeth’s astonishment was","Pride and Prejudice"
"quite equal to what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy","Pride and Prejudice"
"approaching them, and at no great distance. The walk being here less","Pride and Prejudice"
"sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him before they","Pride and Prejudice"
"met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more prepared for an","Pride and Prejudice"
"interview than before, and resolved to appear and to speak with","Pride and Prejudice"
"calmness, if he really intended to meet them. For a few moments, indeed,","Pride and Prejudice"
"she felt that he would probably strike into some other path. The idea","Pride and Prejudice"
"lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view; the","Pride and Prejudice"
"turning past, he was immediately before them. With a glance she saw that","Pride and Prejudice"
"he had lost none of his recent civility; and, to imitate his politeness,","Pride and Prejudice"
"she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place; but she had not","Pride and Prejudice"
"got beyond the words “delightful,” and “charming,” when some unlucky","Pride and Prejudice"
"recollections obtruded, and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from","Pride and Prejudice"
"her might be mischievously construed. Her colour changed, and she said","Pride and Prejudice"
"no more.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her pausing, he asked","Pride and Prejudice"
"her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends.","Pride and Prejudice"
"This was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared; and","Pride and Prejudice"
"she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the","Pride and Prejudice"
"acquaintance of some of those very people, against whom his pride had","Pride and Prejudice"
"revolted, in his offer to herself. “What will be his surprise,” thought","Pride and Prejudice"
"she, “when he knows who they are! He takes them now for people of","Pride and Prejudice"
"fashion.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she named their","Pride and Prejudice"
"relationship to herself, she stole a sly look at him, to see how he bore","Pride and Prejudice"
"it; and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he","Pride and Prejudice"
"could from such disgraceful companions. That he was _surprised_ by the","Pride and Prejudice"
"connection was evident: he sustained it, however, with fortitude: and,","Pride and Prejudice"
"so far from going away, turned back with them, and entered into","Pride and Prejudice"
"conversation with Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased,","Pride and Prejudice"
"could not but triumph. It was consoling that he should know she had some","Pride and Prejudice"
"relations for whom there was no need to blush. She listened most","Pride and Prejudice"
"attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every","Pride and Prejudice"
"expression, every sentence of her uncle, which marked his intelligence,","Pride and Prejudice"
"his taste, or his good manners.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she heard Mr. Darcy","Pride and Prejudice"
"invite him, with the greatest civility, to fish there as often as he","Pride and Prejudice"
"chose, while he continued in the neighbourhood, offering at the same","Pride and Prejudice"
"time to supply him with fishing tackle, and pointing out those parts of","Pride and Prejudice"
"the stream where there was usually most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was","Pride and Prejudice"
"walking arm in arm with Elizabeth, gave her a look expressive of her","Pride and Prejudice"
"wonder. Elizabeth said nothing, but it gratified her exceedingly; the","Pride and Prejudice"
"compliment must be all for herself. Her astonishment, however, was","Pride and Prejudice"
"extreme; and continually was she repeating, “Why is he so altered? From","Pride and Prejudice"
"what can it proceed? It cannot be for _me_, it cannot be for _my_ sake","Pride and Prejudice"
"that his manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could not","Pride and Prejudice"
"work such a change as this. It is impossible that he should still love","Pride and Prejudice"
"me.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the two","Pride and Prejudice"
"gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending to the","Pride and Prejudice"
"brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious","Pride and Prejudice"
"water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It originated in","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the morning, found","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth’s arm inadequate to her support, and consequently preferred","Pride and Prejudice"
"her husband’s. Mr. Darcy took her place by her niece, and they walked on","Pride and Prejudice"
"together. After a short silence the lady first spoke. She wished him to","Pride and Prejudice"
"know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the","Pride and Prejudice"
"place, and accordingly began by observing, that his arrival had been","Pride and Prejudice"
"very unexpected--“for your housekeeper,” she added, “informed us that","Pride and Prejudice"
"you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and, indeed, before we","Pride and Prejudice"
"left Bakewell, we understood that you were not immediately expected in","Pride and Prejudice"
"the country.” He acknowledged the truth of it all; and said that","Pride and Prejudice"
"business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours","Pride and Prejudice"
"before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling. “They","Pride and Prejudice"
"will join me early to-morrow,” he continued, “and among them are some","Pride and Prejudice"
"who will claim an acquaintance with you,--Mr. Bingley and his sisters.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her thoughts were instantly","Pride and Prejudice"
"driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley’s name had been last mentioned","Pride and Prejudice"
"between them; and if she might judge from his complexion, _his_ mind was","Pride and Prejudice"
"not very differently engaged.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“There is also one other person in the party,” he continued after a","Pride and Prejudice"
"pause, “who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will you allow","Pride and Prejudice"
"me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to your acquaintance","Pride and Prejudice"
"during your stay at Lambton?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too great","Pride and Prejudice"
"for her to know in what manner she acceded to it. She immediately felt","Pride and Prejudice"
"that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of being acquainted with her,","Pride and Prejudice"
"must be the work of her brother, and without looking farther, it was","Pride and Prejudice"
"satisfactory; it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made","Pride and Prejudice"
"him think really ill of her.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"They now walked on in silence; each of them deep in thought. Elizabeth","Pride and Prejudice"
"was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she was flattered and","Pride and Prejudice"
"pleased. His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of","Pride and Prejudice"
"the highest kind. They soon outstripped the others; and when they had","Pride and Prejudice"
"reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were half a quarter of a","Pride and Prejudice"
"mile behind.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"He then asked her to walk into the house--but she declared herself not","Pride and Prejudice"
"tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time much might","Pride and Prejudice"
"have been said, and silence was very awkward. She wanted to talk, but","Pride and Prejudice"
"there seemed an embargo on every subject. At last she recollected that","Pride and Prejudice"
"she had been travelling, and they talked of Matlock and Dovedale with","Pride and Prejudice"
"great perseverance. Yet time and her aunt moved slowly--and her patience","Pride and Prejudice"
"and her ideas were nearly worn out before the _tête-à-tête_ was over.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s coming up they were all pressed to go into","Pride and Prejudice"
"the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined, and they","Pride and Prejudice"
"parted on each side with the utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy handed the","Pride and Prejudice"
"ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off, Elizabeth saw him","Pride and Prejudice"
"walking slowly towards the house.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The observations of her uncle and aunt now began; and each of them","Pride and Prejudice"
"pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“He is perfectly well-behaved, polite, and unassuming,” said her uncle.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“There _is_ something a little stately in him, to be sure,” replied her","Pride and Prejudice"
"aunt; “but it is confined to his air, and is not unbecoming. I can now","Pride and Prejudice"
"say with the housekeeper, that though some people may call him proud,","Pride and Prejudice"
"_I_ have seen nothing of it.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us. It was more","Pride and Prejudice"
"than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no necessity for such","Pride and Prejudice"
"attention. His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“To be sure, Lizzy,” said her aunt, “he is not so handsome as Wickham;","Pride and Prejudice"
"or rather he has not Wickham’s countenance, for his features are","Pride and Prejudice"
"perfectly good. But how came you to tell us that he was so","Pride and Prejudice"
"disagreeable?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could: said that she had liked","Pride and Prejudice"
"him better when they met in Kent than before, and that she had never","Pride and Prejudice"
"seen him so pleasant as this morning.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities,” replied","Pride and Prejudice"
"her uncle. “Your great men often are; and therefore I shall not take him","Pride and Prejudice"
"at his word about fishing, as he might change his mind another day, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"warn me off his grounds.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth felt that they had entirely mistaken his character, but said","Pride and Prejudice"
"nothing.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“From what we have seen of him,” continued Mrs. Gardiner, “I really","Pride and Prejudice"
"should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by","Pride and Prejudice"
"anybody as he has done by poor Wickham. He has not an ill-natured look.","Pride and Prejudice"
"On the contrary, there is something pleasing about his mouth when he","Pride and Prejudice"
"speaks. And there is something of dignity in his countenance, that would","Pride and Prejudice"
"not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart. But, to be sure, the","Pride and Prejudice"
"good lady who showed us the house did give him a most flaming character!","Pride and Prejudice"
"I could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes. But he is a liberal","Pride and Prejudice"
"master, I suppose, and _that_, in the eye of a servant, comprehends","Pride and Prejudice"
"every virtue.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of","Pride and Prejudice"
"his behaviour to Wickham; and, therefore, gave them to understand, in as","Pride and Prejudice"
"guarded a manner as she could, that by what she had heard from his","Pride and Prejudice"
"relations in Kent, his actions were capable of a very different","Pride and Prejudice"
"construction; and that his character was by no means so faulty, nor","Pride and Prejudice"
"Wickham’s so amiable, as they had been considered in Hertfordshire. In","Pride and Prejudice"
"confirmation of this, she related the particulars of all the pecuniary","Pride and Prejudice"
"transactions in which they had been connected, without actually naming","Pride and Prejudice"
"her authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned: but as they were now","Pride and Prejudice"
"approaching the scene of her former pleasures, every idea gave way to","Pride and Prejudice"
"the charm of recollection; and she was too much engaged in pointing out","Pride and Prejudice"
"to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs, to think of","Pride and Prejudice"
"anything else. Fatigued as she had been by the morning’s walk, they had","Pride and Prejudice"
"no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former","Pride and Prejudice"
"acquaintance, and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an","Pride and Prejudice"
"intercourse renewed after many years’ discontinuance.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth","Pride and Prejudice"
"much attention for any of these new friends; and she could do nothing","Pride and Prejudice"
"but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy’s civility, and, above","Pride and Prejudice"
"all, of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister.","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"[Illustration]","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his sister to visit","Pride and Prejudice"
"her the very day after her reaching Pemberley; and was, consequently,","Pride and Prejudice"
"resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning.","Pride and Prejudice"
"But her conclusion was false; for on the very morning after their own","Pride and Prejudice"
"arrival at Lambton these visitors came. They had been walking about the","Pride and Prejudice"
"place with some of their new friends, and were just returned to the inn","Pride and Prejudice"
"to dress themselves for dining with the same family, when the sound of a","Pride and Prejudice"
"carriage drew them to a window, and they saw a gentleman and lady in a","Pride and Prejudice"
"curricle driving up the street. Elizabeth, immediately recognizing the","Pride and Prejudice"
"livery, guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of surprise","Pride and Prejudice"
"to her relations, by acquainting them with the honour which she","Pride and Prejudice"
"expected. Her uncle and aunt were all amazement; and the embarrassment","Pride and Prejudice"
"of her manner as she spoke, joined to the circumstance itself, and many","Pride and Prejudice"
"of the circumstances of the preceding day, opened to them a new idea on","Pride and Prejudice"
"the business. Nothing had ever suggested it before, but they now felt","Pride and Prejudice"
"that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such","Pride and Prejudice"
"a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these","Pride and Prejudice"
"newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation of","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth’s feelings was every moment increasing. She was quite amazed","Pride and Prejudice"
"at her own discomposure; but, amongst other causes of disquiet, she","Pride and Prejudice"
"dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in","Pride and Prejudice"
"her favour; and, more than commonly anxious to please, she naturally","Pride and Prejudice"
"suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she walked","Pride and Prejudice"
"up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw such looks of","Pride and Prejudice"
"inquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Miss Darcy and her brother appeared, and this formidable introduction","Pride and Prejudice"
"took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that her new","Pride and Prejudice"
"acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself. Since her","Pride and Prejudice"
"being at Lambton, she had heard that Miss Darcy was exceedingly proud;","Pride and Prejudice"
"but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was","Pride and Prejudice"
"only exceedingly shy. She found it difficult to obtain even a word from","Pride and Prejudice"
"her beyond a monosyllable.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and, though","Pride and Prejudice"
"little more than sixteen, her figure was formed, and her appearance","Pride and Prejudice"
"womanly and graceful. She was less handsome than her brother, but there","Pride and Prejudice"
"was sense and good-humour in her face, and her manners were perfectly","Pride and Prejudice"
"unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had expected to find in her as","Pride and Prejudice"
"acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much","Pride and Prejudice"
"relieved by discerning such different feelings.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"They had not been long together before Darcy told her that Bingley was","Pride and Prejudice"
"also coming to wait on her; and she had barely time to express her","Pride and Prejudice"
"satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when Bingley’s quick step","Pride and Prejudice"
"was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he entered the room. All","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth’s anger against him had been long done away; but had she still","Pride and Prejudice"
"felt any, it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected","Pride and Prejudice"
"cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again. He","Pride and Prejudice"
"inquired in a friendly, though general, way, after her family, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"looked and spoke with the same good-humoured ease that he had ever done.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage","Pride and Prejudice"
"than to herself. They had long wished to see him. The whole party before","Pride and Prejudice"
"them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The suspicions which had just","Pride and Prejudice"
"arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece, directed their observation towards","Pride and Prejudice"
"each with an earnest, though guarded, inquiry; and they soon drew from","Pride and Prejudice"
"those inquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what","Pride and Prejudice"
"it was to love. Of the lady’s sensations they remained a little in","Pride and Prejudice"
"doubt; but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was","Pride and Prejudice"
"evident enough.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth, on her side, had much to do. She wanted to ascertain the","Pride and Prejudice"
"feelings of each of her visitors, she wanted to compose her own, and to","Pride and Prejudice"
"make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter object, where she","Pride and Prejudice"
"feared most to fail, she was most sure of success, for those to whom","Pride and Prejudice"
"she endeavoured to give pleasure were pre-possessed in her favour.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bingley was ready, Georgiana was eager, and Darcy determined, to be","Pride and Prejudice"
"pleased.","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"In seeing Bingley, her thoughts naturally flew to her sister; and oh!","Pride and Prejudice"
"how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a","Pride and Prejudice"
"like manner. Sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on","Pride and Prejudice"
"former occasions, and once or twice pleased herself with the notion","Pride and Prejudice"
"that, as he looked at her, he was trying to trace a resemblance. But,","Pride and Prejudice"
"though this might be imaginary, she could not be deceived as to his","Pride and Prejudice"
"behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had been set up as a rival to Jane. No","Pride and Prejudice"
"look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard. Nothing","Pride and Prejudice"
"occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister. On","Pride and Prejudice"
"this point she was soon satisfied; and two or three little circumstances","Pride and Prejudice"
"occurred ere they parted, which, in her anxious interpretation, denoted","Pride and Prejudice"
"a recollection of Jane, not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of","Pride and Prejudice"
"saying more that might lead to the mention of her, had he dared. He","Pride and Prejudice"
"observed to her, at a moment when the others were talking together, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"in a tone which had something of real regret, that it “was a very long","Pride and Prejudice"
"time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her;” and, before she could","Pride and Prejudice"
"reply, he added, “It is above eight months. We have not met since the","Pride and Prejudice"
"26th of November, when we were all dancing together at Netherfield.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact; and he afterwards","Pride and Prejudice"
"took occasion to ask her, when unattended to by any of the rest, whether","Pride and Prejudice"
"_all_ her sisters were at Longbourn. There was not much in the question,","Pride and Prejudice"
"nor in the preceding remark; but there was a look and a manner which","Pride and Prejudice"
"gave them meaning.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"It was not often that she could turn her eyes on Mr. Darcy himself; but","Pride and Prejudice"
"whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general","Pride and Prejudice"
"complaisance, and in all that he said, she heard an accent so far","Pride and Prejudice"
"removed from _hauteur_ or disdain of his companions, as convinced her","Pride and Prejudice"
"that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed,","Pride and Prejudice"
"however temporary its existence might prove, had at least outlived one","Pride and Prejudice"
"day. When she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance, and courting the","Pride and Prejudice"
"good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would","Pride and Prejudice"
"have been a disgrace; when she saw him thus civil, not only to herself,","Pride and Prejudice"
"but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained, and recollected","Pride and Prejudice"
"their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage, the difference, the","Pride and Prejudice"
"change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her mind, that she could","Pride and Prejudice"
"hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible. Never, even in the","Pride and Prejudice"
"company of his dear friends at Netherfield, or his dignified relations","Pride and Prejudice"
"at Rosings, had she seen him so desirous to please, so free from","Pride and Prejudice"
"self-consequence or unbending reserve, as now, when no importance could","Pride and Prejudice"
"result from the success of his endeavours, and when even the","Pride and Prejudice"
"acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed, would draw","Pride and Prejudice"
"down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and","Pride and Prejudice"
"Rosings.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Their visitors stayed with them above half an hour; and when they arose","Pride and Prejudice"
"to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing","Pride and Prejudice"
"their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss Bennet, to dinner","Pride and Prejudice"
"at Pemberley, before they left the country. Miss Darcy, though with a","Pride and Prejudice"
"diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations,","Pride and Prejudice"
"readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner looked at her niece, desirous of knowing","Pride and Prejudice"
"how _she_, whom the invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its","Pride and Prejudice"
"acceptance, but Elizabeth had turned away her head. Presuming, however,","Pride and Prejudice"
"that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than","Pride and Prejudice"
"any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her husband, who was fond of","Pride and Prejudice"
"society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she ventured to engage for","Pride and Prejudice"
"her attendance, and the day after the next was fixed on.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing Elizabeth","Pride and Prejudice"
"again, having still a great deal to say to her, and many inquiries to","Pride and Prejudice"
"make after all their Hertfordshire friends. Elizabeth, construing all","Pride and Prejudice"
"this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister, was pleased; and","Pride and Prejudice"
"on this account, as well as some others, found herself, when their","Pride and Prejudice"
"visitors left them, capable of considering the last half hour with some","Pride and Prejudice"
"satisfaction, though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been","Pride and Prejudice"
"little. Eager to be alone, and fearful of inquiries or hints from her","Pride and Prejudice"
"uncle and aunt, she stayed with them only long enough to hear their","Pride and Prejudice"
"favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"But she had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s curiosity; it was","Pride and Prejudice"
"not their wish to force her communication. It was evident that she was","Pride and Prejudice"
"much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had before any idea of;","Pride and Prejudice"
"it was evident that he was very much in love with her. They saw much to","Pride and Prejudice"
"interest, but nothing to justify inquiry.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and, as far","Pride and Prejudice"
"as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find. They could","Pride and Prejudice"
"not be untouched by his politeness; and had they drawn his character","Pride and Prejudice"
"from their own feelings and his servant’s report, without any reference","Pride and Prejudice"
"to any other account, the circle in Hertfordshire to which he was known","Pride and Prejudice"
"would not have recognized it for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest,","Pride and Prejudice"
"however, in believing the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible","Pride and Prejudice"
"that the authority of a servant, who had known him since he was four","Pride and Prejudice"
"years old, and whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be","Pride and Prejudice"
"hastily rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of","Pride and Prejudice"
"their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight. They had","Pride and Prejudice"
"nothing to accuse him of but pride; pride he probably had, and if not,","Pride and Prejudice"
"it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small market town","Pride and Prejudice"
"where the family did not visit. It was acknowledged, however, that he","Pride and Prejudice"
"was a liberal man, and did much good among the poor.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he was not held","Pride and Prejudice"
"there in much estimation; for though the chief of his concerns with the","Pride and Prejudice"
"son of his patron were imperfectly understood, it was yet a well-known","Pride and Prejudice"
"fact that, on his quitting Derbyshire, he had left many debts behind","Pride and Prejudice"
"him, which Mr. Darcy afterwards discharged.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"As for Elizabeth, her thoughts were at Pemberley this evening more than","Pride and Prejudice"
"the last; and the evening, though as it passed it seemed long, was not","Pride and Prejudice"
"long enough to determine her feelings towards _one_ in that mansion; and","Pride and Prejudice"
"she lay awake two whole hours, endeavouring to make them out. She","Pride and Prejudice"
"certainly did not hate him. No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she","Pride and Prejudice"
"had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him,","Pride and Prejudice"
"that could be so called. The respect created by the conviction of his","Pride and Prejudice"
"valuable qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some","Pride and Prejudice"
"time ceased to be repugnant to her feelings; and it was now heightened","Pride and Prejudice"
"into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his","Pride and Prejudice"
"favour, and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light,","Pride and Prejudice"
"which yesterday had produced. But above all, above respect and esteem,","Pride and Prejudice"
"there was a motive within her of good-will which could not be","Pride and Prejudice"
"overlooked. It was gratitude;--gratitude, not merely for having once","Pride and Prejudice"
"loved her, but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the","Pride and Prejudice"
"petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him, and all the","Pride and Prejudice"
"unjust accusations accompanying her rejection. He who, she had been","Pride and Prejudice"
"persuaded, would avoid her as his greatest enemy, seemed, on this","Pride and Prejudice"
"accidental meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance; and","Pride and Prejudice"
"without any indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner,","Pride and Prejudice"
"where their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good","Pride and Prejudice"
"opinion of her friends, and bent on making her known to his sister. Such","Pride and Prejudice"
"a change in a man of so much pride excited not only astonishment but","Pride and Prejudice"
"gratitude--for to love, ardent love, it must be attributed; and, as","Pride and Prejudice"
"such, its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged, as by no","Pride and Prejudice"
"means unpleasing, though it could not be exactly defined. She respected,","Pride and Prejudice"
"she esteemed, she was grateful to him, she felt a real interest in his","Pride and Prejudice"
"welfare; and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to","Pride and Prejudice"
"depend upon herself, and how far it would be for the happiness of both","Pride and Prejudice"
"that she should employ the power, which her fancy told her she still","Pride and Prejudice"
"possessed, of bringing on the renewal of his addresses.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"It had been settled in the evening, between the aunt and niece, that","Pride and Prejudice"
"such a striking civility as Miss Darcy’s, in coming to them on the very","Pride and Prejudice"
"day of her arrival at Pemberley--for she had reached it only to a late","Pride and Prejudice"
"breakfast--ought to be imitated, though it could not be equalled, by","Pride and Prejudice"
"some exertion of politeness on their side; and, consequently, that it","Pride and Prejudice"
"would be highly expedient to wait on her at Pemberley the following","Pride and Prejudice"
"morning. They were, therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when","Pride and Prejudice"
"she asked herself the reason, she had very little to say in reply.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme had been","Pride and Prejudice"
"renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made of his meeting","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"[Illustration]","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley’s dislike of her had","Pride and Prejudice"
"originated in jealousy, she could not help feeling how very unwelcome","Pride and Prejudice"
"her appearance at Pemberley must be to her, and was curious to know","Pride and Prejudice"
"with how much civility on that lady’s side the acquaintance would now","Pride and Prejudice"
"be renewed.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the saloon,","Pride and Prejudice"
"whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer. Its windows,","Pride and Prejudice"
"opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody","Pride and Prejudice"
"hills behind the house, and of the beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts","Pride and Prejudice"
"which were scattered over the intermediate lawn.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"In this room they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting there","Pride and Prejudice"
"with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom she lived in","Pride and Prejudice"
"London. Georgiana’s reception of them was very civil, but attended with","Pride and Prejudice"
"all that embarrassment which, though proceeding from shyness and the","Pride and Prejudice"
"fear of doing wrong, would easily give to those who felt themselves","Pride and Prejudice"
"inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and","Pride and Prejudice"
"her niece, however, did her justice, and pitied her.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a courtesy; and","Pride and Prejudice"
"on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such pauses must always be,","Pride and Prejudice"
"succeeded for a few moments. It was first broken by Mrs. Annesley, a","Pride and Prejudice"
"genteel, agreeable-looking woman, whose endeavour to introduce some kind","Pride and Prejudice"
"of discourse proved her to be more truly well-bred than either of the","Pride and Prejudice"
"others; and between her and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth, the conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she","Pride and Prejudice"
"wished for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a","Pride and Prejudice"
"short sentence, when there was least danger of its being heard.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and that she could not speak a word, especially to Miss Darcy, without","Pride and Prejudice"
"calling her attention. This observation would not have prevented her","Pride and Prejudice"
"from trying to talk to the latter, had they not been seated at an","Pride and Prejudice"
"inconvenient distance; but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity","Pride and Prejudice"
"of saying much: her own thoughts were employing her. She expected every","Pride and Prejudice"
"moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room: she wished, she","Pride and Prejudice"
"feared, that the master of the house might be amongst them; and whether","Pride and Prejudice"
"she wished or feared it most, she could scarcely determine. After","Pride and Prejudice"
"sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour, without hearing Miss","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bingley’s voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold","Pride and Prejudice"
"inquiry after the health of her family. She answered with equal","Pride and Prejudice"
"indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the","Pride and Prejudice"
"entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all the","Pride and Prejudice"
"finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till after many a","Pride and Prejudice"
"significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to Miss Darcy had been","Pride and Prejudice"
"given, to remind her of her post. There was now employment for the whole","Pride and Prejudice"
"party; for though they could not all talk, they could all eat; and the","Pride and Prejudice"
"beautiful pyramids of grapes, nectarines, and peaches, soon collected","Pride and Prejudice"
"them round the table.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether","Pride and Prejudice"
"she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr. Darcy, by the","Pride and Prejudice"
"feelings which prevailed on his entering the room; and then, though but","Pride and Prejudice"
"a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate, she began to","Pride and Prejudice"
"regret that he came.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"He had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three other","Pride and Prejudice"
"gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river; and had left him","Pride and Prejudice"
"only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to","Pride and Prejudice"
"Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he appear, than Elizabeth wisely","Pride and Prejudice"
"resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;--a resolution the more","Pride and Prejudice"
"necessary to be made, but perhaps not the more easily kept, because she","Pride and Prejudice"
"saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour","Pride and Prejudice"
"when he first came into the room. In no countenance was attentive","Pride and Prejudice"
"curiosity so strongly marked as in Miss Bingley’s, in spite of the","Pride and Prejudice"
"smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its","Pride and Prejudice"
"objects; for jealousy had not yet made her desperate, and her attentions","Pride and Prejudice"
"to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her brother’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"entrance, exerted herself much more to talk; and Elizabeth saw that he","Pride and Prejudice"
"was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted, and forwarded,","Pride and Prejudice"
"as much as possible, every attempt at conversation on either side. Miss","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bingley saw all this likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the","Pride and Prejudice"
"first opportunity of saying, with sneering civility,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ----shire militia removed from Meryton?","Pride and Prejudice"
"They must be a great loss to _your_ family.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"In Darcy’s presence she dared not mention Wickham’s name: but Elizabeth","Pride and Prejudice"
"instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts; and the","Pride and Prejudice"
"various recollections connected with him gave her a moment’s distress;","Pride and Prejudice"
"but, exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill-natured attack, she","Pride and Prejudice"
"presently answered the question in a tolerably disengaged tone. While","Pride and Prejudice"
"she spoke, an involuntary glance showed her Darcy with a heightened","Pride and Prejudice"
"complexion, earnestly looking at her, and his sister overcome with","Pride and Prejudice"
"confusion, and unable to lift up her eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what","Pride and Prejudice"
"pain she was then giving her beloved friend, she undoubtedly would have","Pride and Prejudice"
"refrained from the hint; but she had merely intended to discompose","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth, by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed","Pride and Prejudice"
"her partial, to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in","Pride and Prejudice"
"Darcy’s opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the latter of all the follies","Pride and Prejudice"
"and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with","Pride and Prejudice"
"that corps. Not a syllable had ever reached her of Miss Darcy’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"meditated elopement. To no creature had it been revealed, where secrecy","Pride and Prejudice"
"was possible, except to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley’s connections","Pride and Prejudice"
"her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it, from that very wish","Pride and Prejudice"
"which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him, of their becoming","Pride and Prejudice"
"hereafter her own. He had certainly formed such a plan; and without","Pride and Prejudice"
"meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from Miss","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bennet, it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern","Pride and Prejudice"
"for the welfare of his friend.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth’s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his emotion; and","Pride and Prejudice"
"as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not approach nearer to","Pride and Prejudice"
"Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time, though not enough to be able","Pride and Prejudice"
"to speak any more. Her brother, whose eye she feared to meet, scarcely","Pride and Prejudice"
"recollected her interest in the affair; and the very circumstance which","Pride and Prejudice"
"had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth, seemed to have","Pride and Prejudice"
"fixed them on her more and more cheerfully.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above","Pride and Prejudice"
"mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their carriage,","Pride and Prejudice"
"Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"person, behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not join her. Her","Pride and Prejudice"
"brother’s recommendation was enough to insure her favour: his judgment","Pride and Prejudice"
"could not err; and he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth, as to leave","Pride and Prejudice"
"Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and","Pride and Prejudice"
"amiable. When Darcy returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help","Pride and Prejudice"
"repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“How very ill Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,” she cried: “I","Pride and Prejudice"
"never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter.","Pride and Prejudice"
"She is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and I were agreeing that we","Pride and Prejudice"
"should not have known her again.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he contented","Pride and Prejudice"
"himself with coolly replying, that he perceived no other alteration than","Pride and Prejudice"
"her being rather tanned,--no miraculous consequence of travelling in the","Pride and Prejudice"
"summer.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“For my own part,” she rejoined, “I must confess that I never could see","Pride and Prejudice"
"any beauty in her. Her face is too thin; her complexion has no","Pride and Prejudice"
"brilliancy; and her features are not at all handsome. Her nose wants","Pride and Prejudice"
"character; there is nothing marked in its lines. Her teeth are","Pride and Prejudice"
"tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for her eyes, which","Pride and Prejudice"
"have sometimes been called so fine, I never could perceive anything","Pride and Prejudice"
"extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish look, which I do not","Pride and Prejudice"
"like at all; and in her air altogether, there is a self-sufficiency","Pride and Prejudice"
"without fashion, which is intolerable.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this was not","Pride and Prejudice"
"the best method of recommending herself; but angry people are not always","Pride and Prejudice"
"wise; and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled, she had all the","Pride and Prejudice"
"success she expected. He was resolutely silent, however; and, from a","Pride and Prejudice"
"determination of making him speak, she continued,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I remember, when we first knew her in Hertfordshire, how amazed we all","Pride and Prejudice"
"were to find that she was a reputed beauty; and I particularly recollect","Pride and Prejudice"
"your saying one night, after they had been dining at Netherfield, ‘_She_","Pride and Prejudice"
"a beauty! I should as soon call her mother a wit.’ But afterwards she","Pride and Prejudice"
"seemed to improve on you, and I believe you thought her rather pretty at","Pride and Prejudice"
"one time.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yes,” replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, “but _that_","Pride and Prejudice"
"was only when I first knew her; for it is many months since I have","Pride and Prejudice"
"considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"He then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the satisfaction of","Pride and Prejudice"
"having forced him to say what gave no one any pain but herself.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their","Pride and Prejudice"
"visit, as they returned, except what had particularly interested them","Pride and Prejudice"
"both. The looks and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed,","Pride and Prejudice"
"except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention. They talked","Pride and Prejudice"
"of his sister, his friends, his house, his fruit, of everything but","Pride and Prejudice"
"himself; yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of","Pride and Prejudice"
"him, and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece’s","Pride and Prejudice"

"[Illustration]","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from","Pride and Prejudice"
"Jane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this disappointment had been","Pride and Prejudice"
"renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there; but on","Pride and Prejudice"
"the third her repining was over, and her sister justified, by the","Pride and Prejudice"
"receipt of two letters from her at once, on one of which was marked that","Pride and Prejudice"
"it had been mis-sent elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as","Pride and Prejudice"
"Jane had written the direction remarkably ill.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and her","Pride and Prejudice"
"uncle and aunt, leaving her to enjoy them in quiet, set off by","Pride and Prejudice"
"themselves. The one mis-sent must be first attended to; it had been","Pride and Prejudice"
"written five days ago. The beginning contained an account of all their","Pride and Prejudice"
"little parties and engagements, with such news as the country afforded;","Pride and Prejudice"
"but the latter half, which was dated a day later, and written in evident","Pride and Prejudice"
"agitation, gave more important intelligence. It was to this effect:--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred of a","Pride and Prejudice"
"most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of alarming you--be","Pride and Prejudice"
"assured that we are all well. What I have to say relates to poor Lydia.","Pride and Prejudice"
"An express came at twelve last night, just as we were all gone to bed,","Pride and Prejudice"
"from Colonel Forster, to inform us that she was gone off to Scotland","Pride and Prejudice"
"with one of his officers; to own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our","Pride and Prejudice"
"surprise. To Kitty, however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am","Pride and Prejudice"
"very, very sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing","Pride and Prejudice"
"to hope the best, and that his character has been misunderstood.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him, but this step (and","Pride and Prejudice"
"let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His choice is","Pride and Prejudice"
"disinterested at least, for he must know my father can give her nothing.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Our poor mother is sadly grieved. My father bears it better. How","Pride and Prejudice"
"thankful am I, that we never let them know what has been said against","Pride and Prejudice"
"him; we must forget it ourselves. They were off Saturday night about","Pride and Prejudice"
"twelve, as is conjectured, but were not missed till yesterday morning at","Pride and Prejudice"
"eight. The express was sent off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have","Pride and Prejudice"
"passed within ten miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect","Pride and Prejudice"
"him here soon. Lydia left a few lines for his wife, informing her of","Pride and Prejudice"
"their intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor","Pride and Prejudice"
"mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I hardly","Pride and Prejudice"
"know what I have written.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely knowing","Pride and Prejudice"
"what she felt, Elizabeth, on finishing this letter, instantly seized the","Pride and Prejudice"
"other, and opening it with the utmost impatience, read as follows: it","Pride and Prejudice"
"had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried letter; I","Pride and Prejudice"
"wish this may be more intelligible, but though not confined for time, my","Pride and Prejudice"
"head is so bewildered that I cannot answer for being coherent. Dearest","Pride and Prejudice"
"Lizzy, I hardly know what I would write, but I have bad news for you,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and it cannot be delayed. Imprudent as a marriage between Mr. Wickham","Pride and Prejudice"
"and our poor Lydia would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has","Pride and Prejudice"
"taken place, for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone","Pride and Prejudice"
"to Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton the","Pride and Prejudice"
"day before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia’s short","Pride and Prejudice"
"letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were going to Gretna","Pride and Prejudice"
"Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing his belief that W.","Pride and Prejudice"
"never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia at all, which was repeated","Pride and Prejudice"
"to Colonel F., who, instantly taking the alarm, set off from B.,","Pride and Prejudice"
"intending to trace their route. He did trace them easily to Clapham, but","Pride and Prejudice"
"no farther; for on entering that place, they removed into a","Pride and Prejudice"
"hackney-coach, and dismissed the chaise that brought them from Epsom.","Pride and Prejudice"
"All that is known after this is, that they were seen to continue the","Pride and Prejudice"
"London road. I know not what to think. After making every possible","Pride and Prejudice"
"inquiry on that side London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire,","Pride and Prejudice"
"anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet","Pride and Prejudice"
"and Hatfield, but without any success,--no such people had been seen to","Pride and Prejudice"
"pass through. With the kindest concern he came on to Longbourn, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart.","Pride and Prejudice"
"I am sincerely grieved for him and Mrs. F.; but no one can throw any","Pride and Prejudice"
"blame on them. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very great. My father and","Pride and Prejudice"
"mother believe the worst, but I cannot think so ill of him. Many","Pride and Prejudice"
"circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married","Pride and Prejudice"
"privately in town than to pursue their first plan; and even if _he_","Pride and Prejudice"
"could form such a design against a young woman of Lydia’s connections,","Pride and Prejudice"
"which is not likely, can I suppose her so lost to everything?","Pride and Prejudice"
"Impossible! I grieve to find, however, that Colonel F. is not disposed","Pride and Prejudice"
"to depend upon their marriage: he shook his head when I expressed my","Pride and Prejudice"
"hopes, and said he feared W. was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother","Pride and Prejudice"
"is really ill, and keeps her room. Could she exert herself, it would be","Pride and Prejudice"
"better, but this is not to be expected; and as to my father, I never in","Pride and Prejudice"
"my life saw him so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having concealed","Pride and Prejudice"
"their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence, one cannot","Pride and Prejudice"
"wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have been spared","Pride and Prejudice"
"something of these distressing scenes; but now, as the first shock is","Pride and Prejudice"
"over, shall I own that I long for your return? I am not so selfish,","Pride and Prejudice"
"however, as to press for it, if inconvenient. Adieu! I take up my pen","Pride and Prejudice"
"again to do, what I have just told you I would not; but circumstances","Pride and Prejudice"
"are such, that I cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as","Pride and Prejudice"
"soon as possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not","Pride and Prejudice"
"afraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to ask of","Pride and Prejudice"
"the former. My father is going to London with Colonel Forster instantly,","Pride and Prejudice"
"to try to discover her. What he means to do, I am sure I know not; but","Pride and Prejudice"
"his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the","Pride and Prejudice"
"best and safest way, and Colonel Forster is obliged to be at Brighton","Pride and Prejudice"
"again to-morrow evening. In such an exigence my uncle’s advice and","Pride and Prejudice"
"assistance would be everything in the world; he will immediately","Pride and Prejudice"
"comprehend what I must feel, and I rely upon his goodness.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Oh! where, where is my uncle?” cried Elizabeth, darting from her seat","Pride and Prejudice"
"as she finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him, without losing a","Pride and Prejudice"
"moment of the time so precious; but as she reached the door, it was","Pride and Prejudice"
"opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy appeared. Her pale face and","Pride and Prejudice"
"impetuous manner made him start, and before he could recover himself","Pride and Prejudice"
"enough to speak, she, in whose mind every idea was superseded by Lydia’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"situation, hastily exclaimed, “I beg your pardon, but I must leave you.","Pride and Prejudice"
"I must find Mr. Gardiner this moment on business that cannot be delayed;","Pride and Prejudice"
"I have not an instant to lose.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Good God! what is the matter?” cried he, with more feeling than","Pride and Prejudice"
"politeness; then recollecting himself, “I will not detain you a minute;","Pride and Prejudice"
"but let me, or let the servant, go after Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner. You are","Pride and Prejudice"
"not well enough; you cannot go yourself.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth hesitated; but her knees trembled under her, and she felt how","Pride and Prejudice"
"little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them. Calling back","Pride and Prejudice"
"the servant, therefore, she commissioned him, though in so breathless an","Pride and Prejudice"
"accent as made her almost unintelligible, to fetch his master and","Pride and Prejudice"
"mistress home instantly.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"On his quitting the room, she sat down, unable to support herself, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to leave her,","Pride and Prejudice"
"or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and commiseration,","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could take to give you","Pride and Prejudice"
"present relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you one? You are very ill.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“No, I thank you,” she replied, endeavouring to recover herself. “There","Pride and Prejudice"

"friends--has eloped; has thrown herself into the power of--of Mr.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton. _You_ know him too","Pride and Prejudice"
"well to doubt the rest. She has no money, no connections, nothing that","Pride and Prejudice"
"can tempt him to--she is lost for ever.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Darcy was fixed in astonishment.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“When I consider,” she added, in a yet more agitated voice, “that _I_","Pride and Prejudice"
"might have prevented it! _I_ who knew what he was. Had I but explained","Pride and Prejudice"
"some part of it only--some part of what I learnt, to my own family! Had","Pride and Prejudice"
"his character been known, this could not have happened. But it is all,","Pride and Prejudice"
"all too late now.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I am grieved, indeed,” cried Darcy: “grieved--shocked. But is it","Pride and Prejudice"
"certain, absolutely certain?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were traced","Pride and Prejudice"
"almost to London, but not beyond: they are certainly not gone to","Pride and Prejudice"
"Scotland.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover her?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“My father has gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my uncle’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"immediate assistance, and we shall be off, I hope, in half an hour. But","Pride and Prejudice"
"nothing can be done; I know very well that nothing can be done. How is","Pride and Prejudice"
"such a man to be worked on? How are they even to be discovered? I have","Pride and Prejudice"
"not the smallest hope. It is every way horrible!”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Darcy shook his head in silent acquiescence.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“When _my_ eyes were opened to his real character, oh! had I known what","Pride and Prejudice"
"I ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not--I was afraid of doing too","Pride and Prejudice"
"much. Wretched, wretched mistake!”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Darcy made no answer. He seemed scarcely to hear her, and was walking up","Pride and Prejudice"
"and down the room in earnest meditation; his brow contracted, his air","Pride and Prejudice"
"gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and instantly understood it. Her power","Pride and Prejudice"
"was sinking; everything _must_ sink under such a proof of family","Pride and Prejudice"
"weakness, such an assurance of the deepest disgrace. She could neither","Pride and Prejudice"
"wonder nor condemn; but the belief of his self-conquest brought nothing","Pride and Prejudice"
"consolatory to her bosom, afforded no palliation of her distress. It","Pride and Prejudice"
"was, on the contrary, exactly calculated to make her understand her own","Pride and Prejudice"
"wishes; and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved","Pride and Prejudice"
"him, as now, when all love must be vain.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her. Lydia--the","Pride and Prejudice"
"humiliation, the misery she was bringing on them all--soon swallowed up","Pride and Prejudice"
"every private care; and covering her face with her handkerchief,","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else; and, after a pause of","Pride and Prejudice"
"several minutes, was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the","Pride and Prejudice"
"voice of her companion, who, in a manner which, though it spoke","Pride and Prejudice"
"compassion, spoke likewise restraint, said,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I am afraid you have been long desiring my absence, nor have I anything","Pride and Prejudice"
"to plead in excuse of my stay, but real, though unavailing concern.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Would to Heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part,","Pride and Prejudice"
"that might offer consolation to such distress! But I will not torment","Pride and Prejudice"
"you with vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.","Pride and Prejudice"
"This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister’s having the","Pride and Prejudice"
"pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Oh, yes! Be so kind as to apologize for us to Miss Darcy. Say that","Pride and Prejudice"
"urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the unhappy truth as","Pride and Prejudice"
"long as it is possible. I know it cannot be long.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"He readily assured her of his secrecy, again expressed his sorrow for","Pride and Prejudice"
"her distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present","Pride and Prejudice"
"reason to hope, and, leaving his compliments for her relations, with","Pride and Prejudice"
"only one serious parting look, went away.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"As he quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they","Pride and Prejudice"
"should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had","Pride and Prejudice"
"marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she threw a","Pride and Prejudice"
"retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance, so full of","Pride and Prejudice"
"contradictions and varieties, sighed at the perverseness of those","Pride and Prejudice"
"feelings which would now have promoted its continuance, and would","Pride and Prejudice"
"formerly have rejoiced in its termination.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection, Elizabeth’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty. But if","Pride and Prejudice"
"otherwise, if the regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or","Pride and Prejudice"
"unnatural, in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a","Pride and Prejudice"
"first interview with its object, and even before two words have been","Pride and Prejudice"
"exchanged, nothing can be said in her defence, except that she had given","Pride and Prejudice"
"somewhat of a trial to the latter method, in her partiality for Wickham,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and that its ill success might, perhaps, authorize her to seek the other","Pride and Prejudice"
"less interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she saw him go","Pride and Prejudice"
"with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia’s infamy must","Pride and Prejudice"
"produce, found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched","Pride and Prejudice"
"business. Never since reading Jane’s second letter had she entertained a","Pride and Prejudice"
"hope of Wickham’s meaning to marry her. No one but Jane, she thought,","Pride and Prejudice"
"could flatter herself with such an expectation. Surprise was the least","Pride and Prejudice"
"of all her feelings on this development. While the contents of the first","Pride and Prejudice"
"letter remained on her mind, she was all surprise, all astonishment,","Pride and Prejudice"
"that Wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry","Pride and Prejudice"
"for money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him had appeared","Pride and Prejudice"
"incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an attachment","Pride and Prejudice"
"as this, she might have sufficient charms; and though she did not","Pride and Prejudice"
"suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement, without the","Pride and Prejudice"
"intention of marriage, she had no difficulty in believing that neither","Pride and Prejudice"
"her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy","Pride and Prejudice"
"prey.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire, that","Pride and Prejudice"
"Lydia had any partiality for him; but she was convinced that Lydia had","Pride and Prejudice"
"wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody. Sometimes one","Pride and Prejudice"
"officer, sometimes another, had been her favourite, as their attentions","Pride and Prejudice"
"raised them in her opinion. Her affections had been continually","Pride and Prejudice"
"fluctuating, but never without an object. The mischief of neglect and","Pride and Prejudice"
"mistaken indulgence towards such a girl--oh! how acutely did she now","Pride and Prejudice"
"feel it!","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She was wild to be at home--to hear, to see, to be upon the spot to","Pride and Prejudice"
"share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her, in a","Pride and Prejudice"
"family so deranged; a father absent, a mother incapable of exertion, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"requiring constant attendance; and though almost persuaded that nothing","Pride and Prejudice"
"could be done for Lydia, her uncle’s interference seemed of the utmost","Pride and Prejudice"
"importance, and till he entered the room the misery of her impatience","Pride and Prejudice"
"was severe. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had hurried back in alarm, supposing,","Pride and Prejudice"
"by the servant’s account, that their niece was taken suddenly ill; but","Pride and Prejudice"
"satisfying them instantly on that head, she eagerly communicated the","Pride and Prejudice"
"cause of their summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on","Pride and Prejudice"
"the postscript of the last with trembling energy. Though Lydia had never","Pride and Prejudice"
"been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not but be","Pride and Prejudice"
"deeply affected. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned in it; and after","Pride and Prejudice"
"the first exclamations of surprise and horror, Mr. Gardiner readily","Pride and Prejudice"
"promised every assistance in his power. Elizabeth, though expecting no","Pride and Prejudice"
"less, thanked him with tears of gratitude; and all three being actuated","Pride and Prejudice"
"by one spirit, everything relating to their journey was speedily","Pride and Prejudice"
"settled. They were to be off as soon as possible. “But what is to be","Pride and Prejudice"
"done about Pemberley?” cried Mrs. Gardiner. “John told us Mr. Darcy was","Pride and Prejudice"
"here when you sent for us;--was it so?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yes; and I told him we should not be able to keep our engagement.","Pride and Prejudice"
"_That_ is all settled.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“What is all settled?” repeated the other, as she ran into her room to","Pride and Prejudice"
"prepare. “And are they upon such terms as for her to disclose the real","Pride and Prejudice"
"truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"But wishes were vain; or, at best, could serve only to amuse her in the","Pride and Prejudice"
"hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth been at leisure","Pride and Prejudice"
"to be idle, she would have remained certain that all employment was","Pride and Prejudice"
"impossible to one so wretched as herself; but she had her share of","Pride and Prejudice"
"business as well as her aunt, and amongst the rest there were notes to","Pride and Prejudice"
"be written to all their friends at Lambton, with false excuses for their","Pride and Prejudice"
"sudden departure. An hour, however, saw the whole completed; and Mr.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Gardiner, meanwhile, having settled his account at the inn, nothing","Pride and Prejudice"
"remained to be done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of","Pride and Prejudice"
"the morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she could","Pride and Prejudice"
"have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to Longbourn.","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"

"[Illustration]","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,” said her uncle, as they","Pride and Prejudice"
"drove from the town; “and really, upon serious consideration, I am much","Pride and Prejudice"
"more inclined than I was to judge as your eldest sister does of the","Pride and Prejudice"
"matter. It appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form","Pride and Prejudice"
"such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or","Pride and Prejudice"
"friendless, and who was actually staying in his Colonel’s family, that I","Pride and Prejudice"
"am strongly inclined to hope the best. Could he expect that her friends","Pride and Prejudice"
"would not step forward? Could he expect to be noticed again by the","Pride and Prejudice"
"regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His temptation is","Pride and Prejudice"
"not adequate to the risk.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Do you really think so?” cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a moment.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Upon my word,” said Mrs. Gardiner, “I begin to be of your uncle’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency, honour, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"interest, for him to be guilty of it. I cannot think so very ill of","Pride and Prejudice"
"Wickham. Can you, yourself, Lizzie, so wholly give him up, as to believe","Pride and Prejudice"
"him capable of it?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Not perhaps of neglecting his own interest. But of every other neglect","Pride and Prejudice"
"I can believe him capable. If, indeed, it should be so! But I dare not","Pride and Prejudice"
"hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland, if that had been the","Pride and Prejudice"
"case?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“In the first place,” replied Mr. Gardiner, “there is no absolute proof","Pride and Prejudice"
"that they are not gone to Scotland.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Oh, but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is such a","Pride and Prejudice"
"presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be found on the","Pride and Prejudice"
"Barnet road.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Well, then,--supposing them to be in London--they may be there, though","Pride and Prejudice"
"for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptionable purpose. It is","Pride and Prejudice"
"not likely that money should be very abundant on either side; and it","Pride and Prejudice"
"might strike them that they could be more economically, though less","Pride and Prejudice"
"expeditiously, married in London, than in Scotland.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must their","Pride and Prejudice"
"marriage be private? Oh, no, no--this is not likely. His most particular","Pride and Prejudice"
"friend, you see by Jane’s account, was persuaded of his never intending","Pride and Prejudice"
"to marry her. Wickham will never marry a woman without some money. He","Pride and Prejudice"
"cannot afford it. And what claims has Lydia, what attractions has she","Pride and Prejudice"
"beyond youth, health, and good humour, that could make him for her sake","Pride and Prejudice"
"forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what","Pride and Prejudice"
"restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a","Pride and Prejudice"
"dishonourable elopement with her, I am not able to judge; for I know","Pride and Prejudice"
"nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But as to your","Pride and Prejudice"
"other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good. Lydia has no","Pride and Prejudice"
"brothers to step forward; and he might imagine, from my father’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"behaviour, from his indolence and the little attention he has ever","Pride and Prejudice"
"seemed to give to what was going forward in his family, that _he_ would","Pride and Prejudice"
"do as little and think as little about it, as any father could do, in","Pride and Prejudice"
"such a matter.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love of him,","Pride and Prejudice"
"as to consent to live with him on any other terms than marriage?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“It does seem, and it is most shocking, indeed,” replied Elizabeth, with","Pride and Prejudice"
"tears in her eyes, “that a sister’s sense of decency and virtue in such","Pride and Prejudice"
"a point should admit of doubt. But, really, I know not what to say.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Perhaps I am not doing her justice. But she is very young: she has never","Pride and Prejudice"
"been taught to think on serious subjects; and for the last half year,","Pride and Prejudice"
"nay, for a twelvemonth, she has been given up to nothing but amusement","Pride and Prejudice"
"and vanity. She has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle","Pride and Prejudice"
"and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in her way.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Since the ----shire were first quartered in Meryton, nothing but love,","Pride and Prejudice"
"flirtation, and officers, have been in her head. She has been doing","Pride and Prejudice"
"everything in her power, by thinking and talking on the subject, to give","Pride and Prejudice"
"greater--what shall I call it?--susceptibility to her feelings; which","Pride and Prejudice"
"are naturally lively enough. And we all know that Wickham has every","Pride and Prejudice"
"charm of person and address that can captivate a woman.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“But you see that Jane,” said her aunt, “does not think so ill of","Pride and Prejudice"
"Wickham, as to believe him capable of the attempt.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever might be","Pride and Prejudice"
"their former conduct, that she would believe capable of such an attempt,","Pride and Prejudice"
"till it were proved against them? But Jane knows, as well as I do, what","Pride and Prejudice"
"Wickham really is. We both know that he has been profligate in every","Pride and Prejudice"
"sense of the word; that he has neither integrity nor honour; that he is","Pride and Prejudice"
"as false and deceitful as he is insinuating.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“And do you really know all this?” cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose curiosity","Pride and Prejudice"
"as to the mode of her intelligence was all alive.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I do, indeed,” replied Elizabeth, colouring. “I told you the other day","Pride and Prejudice"
"of his infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you, yourself, when last at","Pride and Prejudice"
"Longbourn, heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with","Pride and Prejudice"
"such forbearance and liberality towards him. And there are other","Pride and Prejudice"
"circumstances which I am not at liberty--which it is not worth while to","Pride and Prejudice"
"relate; but his lies about the whole Pemberley family are endless. From","Pride and Prejudice"
"what he said of Miss Darcy, I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud,","Pride and Prejudice"
"reserved, disagreeable girl. Yet he knew to the contrary himself. He","Pride and Prejudice"
"must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found","Pride and Prejudice"
"her.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she be ignorant of what you","Pride and Prejudice"
"and Jane seem so well to understand?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Oh, yes!--that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and saw","Pride and Prejudice"
"so much both of Mr. Darcy and his relation Colonel Fitzwilliam, I was","Pride and Prejudice"
"ignorant of the truth myself. And when I returned home the ----shire","Pride and Prejudice"
"was to leave Meryton in a week or fortnight’s time. As that was the","Pride and Prejudice"
"case, neither Jane, to whom I related the whole, nor I, thought it","Pride and Prejudice"
"necessary to make our knowledge public; for of what use could it","Pride and Prejudice"
"apparently be to anyone, that the good opinion, which all the","Pride and Prejudice"
"neighbourhood had of him, should then be overthrown? And even when it","Pride and Prejudice"
"was settled that Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of","Pride and Prejudice"
"opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me. That _she_ could","Pride and Prejudice"
"be in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such a","Pride and Prejudice"
"consequence as _this_ should ensue, you may easily believe was far","Pride and Prejudice"
"enough from my thoughts.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason, I","Pride and Prejudice"
"suppose, to believe them fond of each other?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on either","Pride and Prejudice"
"side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you must be aware","Pride and Prejudice"
"that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away. When first","Pride and Prejudice"
"he entered the corps, she was ready enough to admire him; but so we all","Pride and Prejudice"
"were. Every girl in or near Meryton was out of her senses about him for","Pride and Prejudice"
"the first two months: but he never distinguished _her_ by any particular","Pride and Prejudice"
"attention; and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and","Pride and Prejudice"
"wild admiration, her fancy for him gave way, and others of the regiment,","Pride and Prejudice"
"who treated her with more distinction, again became her favourites.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could be added","Pride and Prejudice"
"to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this interesting subject by","Pride and Prejudice"
"its repeated discussion, no other could detain them from it long, during","Pride and Prejudice"
"the whole of the journey. From Elizabeth’s thoughts it was never absent.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Fixed there by the keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she could","Pride and Prejudice"
"find no interval of ease or forgetfulness.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"They travelled as expeditiously as possible; and sleeping one night on","Pride and Prejudice"
"the road, reached Longbourn by dinnertime the next day. It was a comfort","Pride and Prejudice"
"to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not have been wearied by long","Pride and Prejudice"
"expectations.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were standing","Pride and Prejudice"
"on the steps of the house, as they entered the paddock; and when the","Pride and Prejudice"
"carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise that lighted up their","Pride and Prejudice"
"faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies, in a variety of","Pride and Prejudice"
"capers and frisks, was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth jumped out; and after giving each of them a hasty kiss,","Pride and Prejudice"
"hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running downstairs from","Pride and Prejudice"
"her mother’s apartment, immediately met her.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth, as she affectionately embraced her, whilst tears filled the","Pride and Prejudice"
"eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether anything had been","Pride and Prejudice"
"heard of the fugitives.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Not yet,” replied Jane. “But now that my dear uncle is come, I hope","Pride and Prejudice"
"everything will be well.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Is my father in town?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yes, he went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“And have you heard from him often?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“We have heard only once. He wrote me a few lines on Wednesday, to say","Pride and Prejudice"
"that he had arrived in safety, and to give me his directions, which I","Pride and Prejudice"
"particularly begged him to do. He merely added, that he should not write","Pride and Prejudice"
"again, till he had something of importance to mention.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“And my mother--how is she? How are you all?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her spirits are greatly","Pride and Prejudice"
"shaken. She is upstairs, and will have great satisfaction in seeing you","Pride and Prejudice"
"all. She does not yet leave her dressing-room. Mary and Kitty, thank","Pride and Prejudice"
"Heaven! are quite well.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“But you--how are you?” cried Elizabeth. “You look pale. How much you","Pride and Prejudice"
"must have gone through!”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Her sister, however, assured her of her being perfectly well; and their","Pride and Prejudice"
"conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner were","Pride and Prejudice"
"engaged with their children, was now put an end to by the approach of","Pride and Prejudice"
"the whole party. Jane ran to her uncle and aunt, and welcomed and","Pride and Prejudice"
"thanked them both, with alternate smiles and tears.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which Elizabeth","Pride and Prejudice"
"had already asked were of course repeated by the others, and they soon","Pride and Prejudice"
"found that Jane had no intelligence to give. The sanguine hope of good,","Pride and Prejudice"
"however, which the benevolence of her heart suggested, had not yet","Pride and Prejudice"
"deserted her; she still expected that it would all end well, and that","Pride and Prejudice"
"every morning would bring some letter, either from Lydia or her father,","Pride and Prejudice"
"to explain their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce the marriage.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few minutes’","Pride and Prejudice"
"conversation together, received them exactly as might be expected; with","Pride and Prejudice"
"tears and lamentations of regret, invectives against the villainous","Pride and Prejudice"
"conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her own sufferings and ill-usage;","Pride and Prejudice"
"blaming everybody but the person to whose ill-judging indulgence the","Pride and Prejudice"
"errors of her daughter must be principally owing.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“If I had been able,” said she, “to carry my point in going to Brighton","Pride and Prejudice"
"with all my family, _this_ would not have happened: but poor dear Lydia","Pride and Prejudice"
"had nobody to take care of her. Why did the Forsters ever let her go out","Pride and Prejudice"
"of their sight? I am sure there was some great neglect or other on their","Pride and Prejudice"
"side, for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing, if she had","Pride and Prejudice"
"been well looked after. I always thought they were very unfit to have","Pride and Prejudice"
"the charge of her; but I was over-ruled, as I always am. Poor, dear","Pride and Prejudice"
"child! And now here’s Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he will fight","Pride and Prejudice"
"Wickham, wherever he meets him, and then he will be killed, and what is","Pride and Prejudice"
"to become of us all? The Collinses will turn us out, before he is cold","Pride and Prejudice"
"in his grave; and if you are not kind to us, brother, I do not know what","Pride and Prejudice"
"we shall do.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner, after","Pride and Prejudice"
"general assurances of his affection for her and all her family, told her","Pride and Prejudice"
"that he meant to be in London the very next day, and would assist Mr.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bennet in every endeavour for recovering Lydia.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Do not give way to useless alarm,” added he: “though it is right to be","Pride and Prejudice"
"prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it as certain.","Pride and Prejudice"
"It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a few days more, we","Pride and Prejudice"
"may gain some news of them; and till we know that they are not married,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and have no design of marrying, do not let us give the matter over as","Pride and Prejudice"
"lost. As soon as I get to town, I shall go to my brother, and make him","Pride and Prejudice"
"come home with me to Gracechurch Street, and then we may consult","Pride and Prejudice"
"together as to what is to be done.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Oh, my dear brother,” replied Mrs. Bennet, “that is exactly what I","Pride and Prejudice"
"could most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find them out,","Pride and Prejudice"
"wherever they may be; and if they are not married already, _make_ them","Pride and Prejudice"
"marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not let them wait for that, but","Pride and Prejudice"
"tell Lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them,","Pride and Prejudice"
"after they are married. And, above all things, keep Mr. Bennet from","Pride and Prejudice"
"fighting. Tell him what a dreadful state I am in--that I am frightened","Pride and Prejudice"
"out of my wits; and have such tremblings, such flutterings all over me,","Pride and Prejudice"
"such spasms in my side, and pains in my head, and such beatings at my","Pride and Prejudice"
"heart, that I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear","Pride and Prejudice"
"Lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me,","Pride and Prejudice"
"for she does not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother, how","Pride and Prejudice"
"kind you are! I know you will contrive it all.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"But Mr. Gardiner, though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours","Pride and Prejudice"
"in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation to her, as well in","Pride and Prejudice"
"her hopes as her fears; and after talking with her in this manner till","Pride and Prejudice"
"dinner was on table, they left her to vent all her feelings on the","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real","Pride and Prejudice"
"occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not attempt to","Pride and Prejudice"
"oppose it; for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her","Pride and Prejudice"
"tongue before the servants, while they waited at table, and judged it","Pride and Prejudice"
"better that _one_ only of the household, and the one whom they could","Pride and Prejudice"
"most trust, should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the","Pride and Prejudice"
"subject.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who had been","Pride and Prejudice"
"too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance","Pride and Prejudice"
"before. One came from her books, and the other from her toilette. The","Pride and Prejudice"
"faces of both, however, were tolerably calm; and no change was visible","Pride and Prejudice"
"in either, except that the loss of her favourite sister, or the anger","Pride and Prejudice"
"which she had herself incurred in the business, had given something more","Pride and Prejudice"
"of fretfulness than usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she was","Pride and Prejudice"
"mistress enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance","Pride and Prejudice"
"of grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much talked of.","Pride and Prejudice"
"But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the wounded bosoms of","Pride and Prejudice"
"each other the balm of sisterly consolation.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Then perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she added,","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from it this useful","Pride and Prejudice"
"lesson:--that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable, that one","Pride and Prejudice"
"false step involves her in endless ruin, that her reputation is no less","Pride and Prejudice"
"brittle than it is beautiful, and that she cannot be too much guarded in","Pride and Prejudice"
"her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement, but was too much oppressed to","Pride and Prejudice"
"make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console herself with such","Pride and Prejudice"
"kind of moral extractions from the evil before them.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for half an","Pride and Prejudice"
"hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed herself of the","Pride and Prejudice"
"opportunity of making any inquiries which Jane was equally eager to","Pride and Prejudice"
"satisfy. After joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel","Pride and Prejudice"
"of this event, which Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued","Pride and Prejudice"
"the subject by saying, “But tell me all and everything about it which I","Pride and Prejudice"
"have not already heard. Give me further particulars. What did Colonel","Pride and Prejudice"
"Forster say? Had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement","Pride and Prejudice"
"took place? They must have seen them together for ever.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Colonel Forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality,","Pride and Prejudice"
"especially on Lydia’s side, but nothing to give him any alarm. I am so","Pride and Prejudice"
"grieved for him. His behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost. He","Pride and Prejudice"
"_was_ coming to us, in order to assure us of his concern, before he had","Pride and Prejudice"
"any idea of their not being gone to Scotland: when that apprehension","Pride and Prejudice"
"first got abroad, it hastened his journey.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he know of","Pride and Prejudice"
"their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny himself?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yes; but when questioned by _him_, Denny denied knowing anything of","Pride and Prejudice"
"their plan, and would not give his real opinion about it. He did not","Pride and Prejudice"
"repeat his persuasion of their not marrying, and from _that_ I am","Pride and Prejudice"
"inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you entertained a","Pride and Prejudice"
"doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I felt a","Pride and Prejudice"
"little uneasy--a little fearful of my sister’s happiness with him in","Pride and Prejudice"
"marriage, because I knew that his conduct had not been always quite","Pride and Prejudice"
"right. My father and mother knew nothing of that; they only felt how","Pride and Prejudice"
"imprudent a match it must be. Kitty then owned, with a very natural","Pride and Prejudice"
"triumph on knowing more than the rest of us, that in Lydia’s last letter","Pride and Prejudice"
"she had prepared her for such a step. She had known, it seems, of their","Pride and Prejudice"
"being in love with each other many weeks.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“But not before they went to Brighton?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“No, I believe not.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“And did Colonel Forster appear to think ill of Wickham himself? Does he","Pride and Prejudice"
"know his real character?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I must confess that he did not speak so well of Wickham as he formerly","Pride and Prejudice"
"did. He believed him to be imprudent and extravagant; and since this sad","Pride and Prejudice"
"affair has taken place, it is said that he left Meryton greatly in debt:","Pride and Prejudice"
"but I hope this may be false.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of him,","Pride and Prejudice"
"this could not have happened!”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Perhaps it would have been better,” replied her sister.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“But to expose the former faults of any person, without knowing what","Pride and Prejudice"
"their present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“We acted with the best intentions.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia’s note to his","Pride and Prejudice"
"wife?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“He brought it with him for us to see.”","Pride and Prejudice"

"finished it. “What a letter is this, to be written at such a moment! But","Pride and Prejudice"
"at least it shows that _she_ was serious in the object of her journey.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Whatever he might afterwards persuade her to, it was not on her side a","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I never saw anyone so shocked. He could not speak a word for full ten","Pride and Prejudice"

"did not know the whole story before the end of the day?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I do not know: I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a time is","Pride and Prejudice"
"very difficult. My mother was in hysterics; and though I endeavoured to","Pride and Prejudice"
"give her every assistance in my power, I am afraid I did not do so much","Pride and Prejudice"
"as I might have done. But the horror of what might possibly happen","Pride and Prejudice"
"almost took from me my faculties.”","Pride and Prejudice"

"“Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in every","Pride and Prejudice"

"Kitty is slight and delicate, and Mary studies so much that her hours of","Pride and Prejudice"
"repose should not be broken in on. My aunt Philips came to Longbourn on","Pride and Prejudice"
"Tuesday, after my father went away; and was so good as to stay till","Pride and Prejudice"
"Thursday with me. She was of great use and comfort to us all, and Lady","Pride and Prejudice"
"Lucas has been very kind: she walked here on Wednesday morning to","Pride and Prejudice"
"condole with us, and offered her services, or any of her daughters, if","Pride and Prejudice"
"they could be of use to us.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“She had better have stayed at home,” cried Elizabeth: “perhaps she","Pride and Prejudice"
"_meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one cannot see too","Pride and Prejudice"
"little of one’s neighbours. Assistance is impossible; condolence,","Pride and Prejudice"
"insufferable. Let them triumph over us at a distance, and be satisfied.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She then proceeded to inquire into the measures which her father had","Pride and Prejudice"
"intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his daughter.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“He meant, I believe,” replied Jane, “to go to Epsom, the place where","Pride and Prejudice"
"they last changed horses, see the postilions, and try if anything could","Pride and Prejudice"
"be made out from them. His principal object must be to discover the","Pride and Prejudice"
"number of the hackney coach which took them from Clapham. It had come","Pride and Prejudice"
"with a fare from London; and as he thought the circumstance of a","Pride and Prejudice"

"remarked, he meant to make inquiries at Clapham. If he could anyhow","Pride and Prejudice"
"discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare, he","Pride and Prejudice"
"determined to make inquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible","Pride and Prejudice"
"to find out the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the next","Pride and Prejudice"
"morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line from him.","Pride and Prejudice"
"His family knew him to be, on all common occasions, a most negligent and","Pride and Prejudice"
"dilatory correspondent; but at such a time they had hoped for exertion.","Pride and Prejudice"
"They were forced to conclude, that he had no pleasing intelligence to","Pride and Prejudice"
"send; but even of _that_ they would have been glad to be certain. Mr.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"When he was gone, they were certain at least of receiving constant","Pride and Prejudice"
"information of what was going on; and their uncle promised, at parting,","Pride and Prejudice"
"to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to Longbourn as soon as he could, to","Pride and Prejudice"
"the great consolation of his sister, who considered it as the only","Pride and Prejudice"
"security for her husband’s not being killed in a duel.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a few","Pride and Prejudice"
"days longer, as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to","Pride and Prejudice"
"her nieces. She shared in their attendance on Mrs. Bennet, and was a","Pride and Prejudice"
"great comfort to them in their hours of freedom. Their other aunt also","Pride and Prejudice"
"visited them frequently, and always, as she said, with the design of","Pride and Prejudice"
"cheering and heartening them up--though, as she never came without","Pride and Prejudice"
"reporting some fresh instance of Wickham’s extravagance or irregularity,","Pride and Prejudice"
"she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found","Pride and Prejudice"
"them.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three months","Pride and Prejudice"
"before, had been almost an angel of light. He was declared to be in debt","Pride and Prejudice"
"to every tradesman in the place, and his intrigues, all honoured with","Pride and Prejudice"
"the title of seduction, had been extended into every tradesman’s family.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world; and","Pride and Prejudice"
"everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the","Pride and Prejudice"
"appearance of his goodness. Elizabeth, though she did not credit above","Pride and Prejudice"
"half of what was said, believed enough to make her former assurance of","Pride and Prejudice"
"her sister’s ruin still more certain; and even Jane, who believed still","Pride and Prejudice"
"less of it, became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now","Pride and Prejudice"
"come, when, if they had gone to Scotland, which she had never before","Pride and Prejudice"
"entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained some","Pride and Prejudice"
"news of them.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday, his wife received a","Pride and Prejudice"
"letter from him: it told them, that on his arrival he had immediately","Pride and Prejudice"
"found out his brother, and persuaded him to come to Gracechurch Street.","Pride and Prejudice"
"That Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and Clapham, before his arrival, but","Pride and Prejudice"
"without gaining any satisfactory information; and that he was now","Pride and Prejudice"
"determined to inquire at all the principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet","Pride and Prejudice"
"thought it possible they might have gone to one of them, on their first","Pride and Prejudice"
"coming to London, before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself","Pride and Prejudice"
"did not expect any success from this measure; but as his brother was","Pride and Prejudice"
"eager in it, he meant to assist him in pursuing it. He added, that Mr.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"promised to write again very soon. There was also a postscript to this","Pride and Prejudice"
"effect:--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him to find out, if","Pride and Prejudice"
"possible, from some of the young man’s intimates in the regiment,","Pride and Prejudice"
"whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to","Pride and Prejudice"
"know in what part of the town he has now concealed himself. If there","Pride and Prejudice"
"were anyone that one could apply to, with a probability of gaining such","Pride and Prejudice"
"a clue as that, it might be of essential consequence. At present we have","Pride and Prejudice"
"nothing to guide us. Colonel Forster will, I dare say, do everything in","Pride and Prejudice"
"his power to satisfy us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps","Pride and Prejudice"
"Lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any","Pride and Prejudice"
"other person.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference for","Pride and Prejudice"
"her authority proceeded; but it was not in her power to give any","Pride and Prejudice"
"information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She had never heard of his having had any relations, except a father","Pride and Prejudice"
"and mother, both of whom had been dead many years. It was possible,","Pride and Prejudice"
"however, that some of his companions in the ----shire might be able to","Pride and Prejudice"
"give more information; and though she was not very sanguine in expecting","Pride and Prejudice"
"it, the application was a something to look forward to.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most anxious","Pride and Prejudice"
"part of each was when the post was expected. The arrival of letters was","Pride and Prejudice"
"the first grand object of every morning’s impatience. Through letters,","Pride and Prejudice"
"whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated; and every","Pride and Prejudice"
"succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived for","Pride and Prejudice"
"their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins; which, as Jane","Pride and Prejudice"
"had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence,","Pride and Prejudice"
"she accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew what curiosities his","Pride and Prejudice"
"letters always were, looked over her, and read it likewise. It was as","Pride and Prejudice"
"follows:--","Pride and Prejudice"

"     /* “My dear Sir, */","Pride and Prejudice"

"     “I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation","Pride and Prejudice"
"     in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now","Pride and Prejudice"
"     suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a letter","Pride and Prejudice"
"     from Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs. Collins and","Pride and Prejudice"
"     myself sincerely sympathize with you, and all your respectable","Pride and Prejudice"
"     family, in your present distress, which must be of the bitterest","Pride and Prejudice"
"     kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove. No","Pride and Prejudice"
"     arguments shall be wanting on my part, that can alleviate so severe","Pride and Prejudice"
"     a misfortune; or that may comfort you, under a circumstance that","Pride and Prejudice"
"     must be, of all others, most afflicting to a parent’s mind. The","Pride and Prejudice"
"     death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of","Pride and Prejudice"
"     this. And it is the more to be lamented, because there is reason to","Pride and Prejudice"

"     at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and Mrs. Bennet,","Pride and Prejudice"
"     I am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally","Pride and Prejudice"
"     bad, or she could not be guilty of such an enormity, at so early an","Pride and Prejudice"

"     which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins, but likewise by","Pride and Prejudice"
"     Lady Catherine and her daughter, to whom I have related the affair.","Pride and Prejudice"
"     They agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one","Pride and Prejudice"
"     daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others: for","Pride and Prejudice"
"     who, as Lady Catherine herself condescendingly says, will connect","Pride and Prejudice"
"     themselves with such a family? And this consideration leads me,","Pride and Prejudice"
"     moreover, to reflect, with augmented satisfaction, on a certain","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Gardiner did not write again, till he had received an answer from","Pride and Prejudice"
"Colonel Forster; and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send.","Pride and Prejudice"
"It was not known that Wickham had a single relation with whom he kept up","Pride and Prejudice"
"any connection, and it was certain that he had no near one living. His","Pride and Prejudice"
"former acquaintance had been numerous; but since he had been in the","Pride and Prejudice"
"militia, it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship","Pride and Prejudice"
"with any of them. There was no one, therefore, who could be pointed out","Pride and Prejudice"
"as likely to give any news of him. And in the wretched state of his own","Pride and Prejudice"
"finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in addition to","Pride and Prejudice"
"his fear of discovery by Lydia’s relations; for it had just transpired","Pride and Prejudice"
"that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Colonel Forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be","Pride and Prejudice"
"necessary to clear his expenses at Brighton. He owed a good deal in the","Pride and Prejudice"
"town, but his debts of honour were still more formidable. Mr. Gardiner","Pride and Prejudice"
"did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family;","Pride and Prejudice"
"Jane heard them with horror. “A gamester!” she cried. “This is wholly","Pride and Prejudice"
"unexpected; I had not an idea of it.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Gardiner added, in his letter, that they might expect to see their","Pride and Prejudice"
"father at home on the following day, which was Saturday. Rendered","Pride and Prejudice"
"spiritless by the ill success of all their endeavours, he had yielded to","Pride and Prejudice"
"his brother-in-law’s entreaty that he would return to his family and","Pride and Prejudice"
"leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable","Pride and Prejudice"
"for continuing their pursuit. When Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she did","Pride and Prejudice"
"not express so much satisfaction as her children expected, considering","Pride and Prejudice"
"what her anxiety for his life had been before.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“What! is he coming home, and without poor Lydia?” she cried. “Sure he","Pride and Prejudice"
"will not leave London before he has found them. Who is to fight Wickham,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and make him marry her, if he comes away?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that she","Pride and Prejudice"
"and her children should go to London at the same time that Mr. Bennet","Pride and Prejudice"
"came from it. The coach, therefore, took them the first stage of their","Pride and Prejudice"
"journey, and brought its master back to Longbourn.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and her","Pride and Prejudice"
"Derbyshire friend, that had attended her from that part of the world.","Pride and Prejudice"
"His name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece;","Pride and Prejudice"
"and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs. Gardiner had formed, of","Pride and Prejudice"
"their being followed by a letter from him, had ended in nothing.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth had received none since her return, that could come from","Pride and Prejudice"
"Pemberley.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for","Pride and Prejudice"
"the lowness of her spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore, could be","Pride and Prejudice"
"fairly conjectured from _that_,--though Elizabeth, who was by this time","Pride and Prejudice"
"tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings, was perfectly aware","Pride and Prejudice"
"that, had she known nothing of Darcy, she could have borne the dread of","Pride and Prejudice"
"Lydia’s infamy somewhat better. It would have spared her, she thought,","Pride and Prejudice"
"one sleepless night out of two.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"When Mr. Bennet arrived, he had all the appearance of his usual","Pride and Prejudice"
"philosophic composure. He said as little as he had ever been in the","Pride and Prejudice"
"habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had taken him","Pride and Prejudice"
"away; and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of","Pride and Prejudice"
"it.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"It was not till the afternoon, when he joined them at tea, that","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on her briefly","Pride and Prejudice"
"expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured, he replied, “Say","Pride and Prejudice"
"nothing of that. Who should suffer but myself? It has been my own doing,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and I ought to feel it.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You must not be too severe upon yourself,” replied Elizabeth.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so prone to","Pride and Prejudice"
"fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how much I have","Pride and Prejudice"
"been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression.","Pride and Prejudice"
"It will pass away soon enough.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Do you suppose them to be in London?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?”","Pride and Prejudice"

"“And Lydia used to want to go to London,” added Kitty.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“She is happy, then,” said her father, drily; “and her residence there","Pride and Prejudice"
"will probably be of some duration.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Then, after a short silence, he continued, “Lizzy, I bear you no","Pride and Prejudice"
"ill-will for being justified in your advice to me last May, which,","Pride and Prejudice"

"Two days after Mr. Bennet’s return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking","Pride and Prejudice"
"together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper","Pride and Prejudice"
"coming towards them, and concluding that she came to call them to their","Pride and Prejudice"
"mother, went forward to meet her; but instead of the expected summons,","Pride and Prejudice"
"when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, “I beg your pardon,","Pride and Prejudice"
"madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some","Pride and Prejudice"
"good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Dear madam,” cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, “don’t you know","Pride and Prejudice"
"there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He has been here","Pride and Prejudice"
"this half hour, and master has had a letter.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech. They","Pride and Prejudice"
"ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from thence to the","Pride and Prejudice"
"library;--their father was in neither; and they were on the point of","Pride and Prejudice"
"seeking him upstairs with their mother, when they were met by the","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“If you are looking for my master, ma’am, he is walking towards the","Pride and Prejudice"
"little copse.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall once more,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and ran across the lawn after their father, who was deliberately","Pride and Prejudice"
"pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Jane, who was not so light, nor so much in the habit of running as","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath,","Pride and Prejudice"
"came up with him, and eagerly cried out,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Oh, papa, what news? what news? have you heard from my uncle?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yes, I have had a letter from him by express.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Well, and what news does it bring--good or bad?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“What is there of good to be expected?” said he, taking the letter from","Pride and Prejudice"
"his pocket; “but perhaps you would like to read it.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand. Jane now came up.","Pride and Prejudice"

"“Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But there","Pride and Prejudice"

"gone.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“That is very true,” said Elizabeth; “though it had not occurred to me","Pride and Prejudice"
"before. His debts to be discharged, and something still to remain! Oh,","Pride and Prejudice"
"it must be my uncle’s doings! Generous, good man, I am afraid he has","Pride and Prejudice"
"distressed himself. A small sum could not do all this.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“No,” said her father. “Wickham’s a fool if he takes her with a farthing","Pride and Prejudice"
"less than ten thousand pounds: I should be sorry to think so ill of him,","Pride and Prejudice"
"in the very beginning of our relationship.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be","Pride and Prejudice"
"repaid?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Bennet made no answer; and each of them, deep in thought, continued","Pride and Prejudice"
"silent till they reached the house. Their father then went to the","Pride and Prejudice"
"library to write, and the girls walked into the breakfast-room.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“And they are really to be married!” cried Elizabeth, as soon as they","Pride and Prejudice"
"were by themselves. “How strange this is! and for _this_ we are to be","Pride and Prejudice"
"thankful. That they should marry, small as is their chance of happiness,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and wretched as is his character, we are forced to rejoice! Oh, Lydia!”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I comfort myself with thinking,” replied Jane, “that he certainly would","Pride and Prejudice"
"not marry Lydia, if he had not a real regard for her. Though our kind","Pride and Prejudice"
"uncle has done something towards clearing him, I cannot believe that ten","Pride and Prejudice"
"thousand pounds, or anything like it, has been advanced. He has children","Pride and Prejudice"
"of his own, and may have more. How could he spare half ten thousand","Pride and Prejudice"
"pounds?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“If we are ever able to learn what Wickham’s debts have been,” said","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth, “and how much is settled on his side on our sister, we shall","Pride and Prejudice"
"exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for them, because Wickham has","Pride and Prejudice"
"not sixpence of his own. The kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be","Pride and Prejudice"
"requited. Their taking her home, and affording her their personal","Pride and Prejudice"
"protection and countenance, is such a sacrifice to her advantage as","Pride and Prejudice"
"years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she is","Pride and Prejudice"
"actually with them! If such goodness does not make her miserable now,","Pride and Prejudice"
"she will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her, when she","Pride and Prejudice"
"first sees my aunt!”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,” said","Pride and Prejudice"
"Jane: “I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His consenting to marry","Pride and Prejudice"
"her is a proof, I will believe, that he is come to a right way of","Pride and Prejudice"
"thinking. Their mutual affection will steady them; and I flatter myself","Pride and Prejudice"
"they will settle so quietly, and live in so rational a manner, as may in","Pride and Prejudice"
"time make their past imprudence forgotten.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Their conduct has been such,” replied Elizabeth, “as neither you, nor","Pride and Prejudice"
"I, nor anybody, can ever forget. It is useless to talk of it.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood","Pride and Prejudice"
"perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to the library,","Pride and Prejudice"
"therefore, and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make","Pride and Prejudice"
"it known to her. He was writing, and, without raising his head, coolly","Pride and Prejudice"
"replied,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Just as you please.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“May we take my uncle’s letter to read to her?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Take whatever you like, and get away.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth took the letter from his writing-table, and they went upstairs","Pride and Prejudice"
"together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet: one communication","Pride and Prejudice"
"would, therefore, do for all. After a slight preparation for good news,","Pride and Prejudice"
"the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet could hardly contain herself. As","Pride and Prejudice"
"soon as Jane had read Mr. Gardiner’s hope of Lydia’s being soon married,","Pride and Prejudice"
"her joy burst forth, and every following sentence added to its","Pride and Prejudice"
"exuberance. She was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she","Pride and Prejudice"
"had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her daughter","Pride and Prejudice"
"would be married was enough. She was disturbed by no fear for her","Pride and Prejudice"
"felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“My dear, dear Lydia!” she cried: “this is delightful indeed! She will","Pride and Prejudice"
"be married! I shall see her again! She will be married at sixteen! My","Pride and Prejudice"
"good, kind brother! I knew how it would be--I knew he would manage","Pride and Prejudice"
"everything. How I long to see her! and to see dear Wickham too! But the","Pride and Prejudice"
"clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write to my sister Gardiner about","Pride and Prejudice"
"them directly. Lizzy, my dear, run down to your father, and ask him how","Pride and Prejudice"
"much he will give her. Stay, stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell,","Pride and Prejudice"
"Kitty, for Hill. I will put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear","Pride and Prejudice"
"Lydia! How merry we shall be together when we meet!”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Her eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the violence of","Pride and Prejudice"
"these transports, by leading her thoughts to the obligations which Mr.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Gardiner’s behaviour laid them all under.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“For we must attribute this happy conclusion,” she added, “in a great","Pride and Prejudice"
"measure to his kindness. We are persuaded that he has pledged himself to","Pride and Prejudice"
"assist Mr. Wickham with money.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Well,” cried her mother, “it is all very right; who should do it but","Pride and Prejudice"
"her own uncle? If he had not had a family of his own, I and my children","Pride and Prejudice"
"must have had all his money, you know; and it is the first time we have","Pride and Prejudice"
"ever had anything from him except a few presents. Well! I am so happy.","Pride and Prejudice"
"In a short time, I shall have a daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well","Pride and Prejudice"
"it sounds! And she was only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in","Pride and Prejudice"
"such a flutter, that I am sure I can’t write; so I will dictate, and you","Pride and Prejudice"
"write for me. We will settle with your father about the money","Pride and Prejudice"
"afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders, had","Pride and Prejudice"
"not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her to wait till her","Pride and Prejudice"
"father was at leisure to be consulted. One day’s delay, she observed,","Pride and Prejudice"
"would be of small importance; and her mother was too happy to be quite","Pride and Prejudice"
"so obstinate as usual. Other schemes, too, came into her head.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I will go to Meryton,” said she, “as soon as I am dressed, and tell the","Pride and Prejudice"
"good, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come back, I can call on","Pride and Prejudice"
"Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and order the carriage. An","Pride and Prejudice"

"congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took","Pride and Prejudice"
"refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom. Poor Lydia’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it was no worse, she","Pride and Prejudice"
"had need to be thankful. She felt it so; and though, in looking forward,","Pride and Prejudice"
"neither rational happiness, nor worldly prosperity could be justly","Pride and Prejudice"

"Mr. Bennet had very often wished, before this period of his life, that,","Pride and Prejudice"
"instead of spending his whole income, he had laid by an annual sum, for","Pride and Prejudice"
"the better provision of his children, and of his wife, if she survived","Pride and Prejudice"
"him. He now wished it more than ever. Had he done his duty in that","Pride and Prejudice"
"respect, Lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of","Pride and Prejudice"
"honour or credit could now be purchased for her. The satisfaction of","Pride and Prejudice"
"prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in Great Britain to","Pride and Prejudice"
"be her husband might then have rested in its proper place.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"He was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone","Pride and Prejudice"
"should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brother-in-law; and he","Pride and Prejudice"
"was determined, if possible, to find out the extent of his assistance,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be perfectly","Pride and Prejudice"
"useless; for, of course, they were to have a son. This son was to join","Pride and Prejudice"
"in cutting off the entail, as soon as he should be of age, and the widow","Pride and Prejudice"
"and younger children would by that means be provided for. Five daughters","Pride and Prejudice"
"successively entered the world, but yet the son was to come; and Mrs.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bennet, for many years after Lydia’s birth, had been certain that he","Pride and Prejudice"
"would. This event had at last been despaired of, but it was then too","Pride and Prejudice"
"late to be saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy; and her","Pride and Prejudice"
"husband’s love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their","Pride and Prejudice"
"income.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs. Bennet and","Pride and Prejudice"
"the children. But in what proportions it should be divided amongst the","Pride and Prejudice"
"latter depended on the will of the parents. This was one point, with","Pride and Prejudice"
"regard to Lydia at least, which was now to be settled, and Mr. Bennet","Pride and Prejudice"
"could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him. In","Pride and Prejudice"
"terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother, though","Pride and Prejudice"
"expressed most concisely, he then delivered on paper his perfect","Pride and Prejudice"
"approbation of all that was done, and his willingness to fulfil the","Pride and Prejudice"
"engagements that had been made for him. He had never before supposed","Pride and Prejudice"
"that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter, it would be","Pride and Prejudice"
"done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present","Pride and Prejudice"
"arrangement. He would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser, by the","Pride and Prejudice"
"hundred that was to be paid them; for, what with her board and pocket","Pride and Prejudice"
"allowance, and the continual presents in money which passed to her","Pride and Prejudice"
"through her mother’s hands, Lydia’s expenses had been very little within","Pride and Prejudice"
"that sum.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side, too, was","Pride and Prejudice"
"another very welcome surprise; for his chief wish at present was to have","Pride and Prejudice"
"as little trouble in the business as possible. When the first transports","Pride and Prejudice"
"of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over, he","Pride and Prejudice"
"naturally returned to all his former indolence. His letter was soon","Pride and Prejudice"
"despatched; for though dilatory in undertaking business, he was quick in","Pride and Prejudice"
"its execution. He begged to know further particulars of what he was","Pride and Prejudice"
"indebted to his brother; but was too angry with Lydia to send any","Pride and Prejudice"
"message to her.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The good news quickly spread through the house; and with proportionate","Pride and Prejudice"
"speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in the latter with decent","Pride and Prejudice"
"philosophy. To be sure, it would have been more for the advantage of","Pride and Prejudice"
"conversation, had Miss Lydia Bennet come upon the town; or, as the","Pride and Prejudice"
"happiest alternative, been secluded from the world in some distant","Pride and Prejudice"
"farm-house. But there was much to be talked of, in marrying her; and the","Pride and Prejudice"
"good-natured wishes for her well-doing, which had proceeded before from","Pride and Prejudice"
"all the spiteful old ladies in Meryton, lost but little of their spirit","Pride and Prejudice"
"in this change of circumstances, because with such a husband her misery","Pride and Prejudice"
"was considered certain.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been down stairs, but on this","Pride and Prejudice"
"happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table, and in","Pride and Prejudice"
"spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a damp to her","Pride and Prejudice"
"triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been the first object of","Pride and Prejudice"
"her wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on the point of","Pride and Prejudice"
"accomplishment, and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those","Pride and Prejudice"
"attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new carriages, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"servants. She was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a","Pride and Prejudice"
"proper situation for her daughter; and, without knowing or considering","Pride and Prejudice"
"what their income might be, rejected many as deficient in size and","Pride and Prejudice"
"importance.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Haye Park might do,” said she, “if the Gouldings would quit it, or the","Pride and Prejudice"
"great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger; but Ashworth is","Pride and Prejudice"
"too far off. I could not bear to have her ten miles from me; and as for","Pride and Prejudice"
"Purvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the","Pride and Prejudice"
"servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he said to her, “Mrs.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bennet, before you take any, or all of these houses, for your son and","Pride and Prejudice"
"daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into _one_ house in this","Pride and Prejudice"
"neighbourhood they shall never have admittance. I will not encourage the","Pride and Prejudice"
"imprudence of either, by receiving them at Longbourn.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was firm: it","Pride and Prejudice"
"soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with amazement and horror,","Pride and Prejudice"
"that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his","Pride and Prejudice"
"daughter. He protested that she should receive from him no mark of","Pride and Prejudice"
"affection whatever on the occasion. Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend","Pride and Prejudice"
"it. That his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable","Pride and Prejudice"
"resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege, without which her","Pride and Prejudice"
"marriage would scarcely seem valid, exceeded all that she could believe","Pride and Prejudice"
"possible. She was more alive to the disgrace, which her want of new","Pride and Prejudice"
"clothes must reflect on her daughter’s nuptials, than to any sense of","Pride and Prejudice"
"shame at her eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they","Pride and Prejudice"
"took place.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had, from the distress of","Pride and Prejudice"
"the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted with their fears for","Pride and Prejudice"
"her sister; for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper","Pride and Prejudice"
"termination to the elopement, they might hope to conceal its","Pride and Prejudice"
"unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the","Pride and Prejudice"
"spot.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She had no fear of its spreading farther, through his means. There were","Pride and Prejudice"
"few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended;","Pride and Prejudice"
"but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sister’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"frailty would have mortified her so much. Not, however, from any fear of","Pride and Prejudice"
"disadvantage from it individually to herself; for at any rate there","Pride and Prejudice"
"seemed a gulf impassable between them. Had Lydia’s marriage been","Pride and Prejudice"
"concluded on the most honourable terms, it was not to be supposed that","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Darcy would connect himself with a family, where to every other","Pride and Prejudice"
"objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest","Pride and Prejudice"
"kind with the man whom he so justly scorned.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"From such a connection she could not wonder that he should shrink. The","Pride and Prejudice"
"wish of procuring her regard, which she had assured herself of his","Pride and Prejudice"
"feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation survive such a","Pride and Prejudice"
"blow as this. She was humbled, she was grieved; she repented, though she","Pride and Prejudice"
"hardly knew of what. She became jealous of his esteem, when she could no","Pride and Prejudice"
"longer hope to be benefited by it. She wanted to hear of him, when there","Pride and Prejudice"
"seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence. She was convinced that","Pride and Prejudice"
"she could have been happy with him, when it was no longer likely they","Pride and Prejudice"
"should meet.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"What a triumph for him, as she often thought, could he know that the","Pride and Prejudice"
"proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now","Pride and Prejudice"
"have been gladly and gratefully received! He was as generous, she","Pride and Prejudice"
"doubted not, as the most generous of his sex. But while he was mortal,","Pride and Prejudice"
"there must be a triumph.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who, in","Pride and Prejudice"
"disposition and talents, would most suit her. His understanding and","Pride and Prejudice"
"temper, though unlike her own, would have answered all her wishes. It","Pride and Prejudice"
"was an union that must have been to the advantage of both: by her ease","Pride and Prejudice"
"and liveliness, his mind might have been softened, his manners improved;","Pride and Prejudice"
"and from his judgment, information, and knowledge of the world, she must","Pride and Prejudice"
"have received benefit of greater importance.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what","Pride and Prejudice"
"connubial felicity really was. An union of a different tendency, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"precluding the possibility of the other, was soon to be formed in their","Pride and Prejudice"
"family.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she","Pride and Prejudice"
"could not imagine. But how little of permanent happiness could belong to","Pride and Prejudice"
"a couple who were only brought together because their passions were","Pride and Prejudice"
"stronger than their virtue, she could easily conjecture.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his brother. To Mr. Bennet’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"acknowledgments he briefly replied, with assurances of his eagerness to","Pride and Prejudice"
"promote the welfare of any of his family; and concluded with entreaties","Pride and Prejudice"
"that the subject might never be mentioned to him again. The principal","Pride and Prejudice"
"purport of his letter was to inform them, that Mr. Wickham had resolved","Pride and Prejudice"
"on quitting the militia.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“It was greatly my wish that he should do so,” he added, “as soon as his","Pride and Prejudice"
"marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me, in","Pride and Prejudice"
"considering a removal from that corps as highly advisable, both on his","Pride and Prejudice"
"account and my niece’s. It is Mr. Wickham’s intention to go into the","Pride and Prejudice"
"Regulars; and, among his former friends, there are still some who are","Pride and Prejudice"
"able and willing to assist him in the army. He has the promise of an","Pride and Prejudice"
"ensigncy in General----’s regiment, now quartered in the north. It is","Pride and Prejudice"
"an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom. He","Pride and Prejudice"
"promises fairly; and I hope among different people, where they may each","Pride and Prejudice"
"have a character to preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have","Pride and Prejudice"
"written to Colonel Forster, to inform him of our present arrangements,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of Mr. Wickham","Pride and Prejudice"
"in and near Brighton with assurances of speedy payment, for which I have","Pride and Prejudice"
"pledged myself. And will you give yourself the trouble of carrying","Pride and Prejudice"
"similar assurances to his creditors in Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin","Pride and Prejudice"
"a list, according to his information? He has given in all his debts; I","Pride and Prejudice"
"hope at least he has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"all will be completed in a week. They will then join his regiment,","Pride and Prejudice"
"unless they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she","Pride and Prejudice"
"leaves the south. She is well, and begs to be dutifully remembered to","Pride and Prejudice"
"you and her mother.--Yours, etc.","Pride and Prejudice"

"“E. GARDINER.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"removal from the ----shire, as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mrs. Bennet was not so well pleased with it. Lydia’s being settled in","Pride and Prejudice"
"the north, just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her","Pride and Prejudice"
"company, for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in","Pride and Prejudice"
"Hertfordshire, was a severe disappointment; and, besides, it was such a","Pride and Prejudice"
"pity that Lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted","Pride and Prejudice"
"with everybody, and had so many favourites.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“She is so fond of Mrs. Forster,” said she, “it will be quite shocking","Pride and Prejudice"
"to send her away! And there are several of the young men, too, that she","Pride and Prejudice"
"likes very much. The officers may not be so pleasant in General----’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"regiment.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"His daughter’s request, for such it might be considered, of being","Pride and Prejudice"
"admitted into her family again, before she set off for the north,","Pride and Prejudice"
"received at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth, who","Pride and Prejudice"
"agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister’s feelings and","Pride and Prejudice"
"consequence, that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents,","Pride and Prejudice"
"urged him so earnestly, yet so rationally and so mildly, to receive her","Pride and Prejudice"
"and her husband at Longbourn, as soon as they were married, that he was","Pride and Prejudice"
"prevailed on to think as they thought, and act as they wished. And their","Pride and Prejudice"
"mother had the satisfaction of knowing, that she should be able to show","Pride and Prejudice"
"her married daughter in the neighbourhood, before she was banished to","Pride and Prejudice"
"the north. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his brother, therefore, he","Pride and Prejudice"
"sent his permission for them to come; and it was settled, that, as soon","Pride and Prejudice"
"as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to Longbourn. Elizabeth","Pride and Prejudice"
"was surprised, however, that Wickham should consent to such a scheme;","Pride and Prejudice"
"and, had she consulted only her own inclination, any meeting with him","Pride and Prejudice"
"would have been the last object of her wishes.","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Their sister’s wedding-day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt for her","Pride and Prejudice"
"probably more than she felt for herself. The carriage was sent to meet","Pride and Prejudice"
"them at----, and they were to return in it by dinnertime. Their arrival","Pride and Prejudice"
"was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets--and Jane more especially, who","Pride and Prejudice"
"gave Lydia the feelings which would have attended herself, had _she_","Pride and Prejudice"
"been the culprit, and was wretched in the thought of what her sister","Pride and Prejudice"
"must endure.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast-room to receive","Pride and Prejudice"
"them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet, as the carriage drove up to","Pride and Prejudice"
"the door; her husband looked impenetrably grave; her daughters, alarmed,","Pride and Prejudice"
"anxious, uneasy.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Lydia’s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown open, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"she ran into the room. Her mother stepped forwards, embraced her, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"welcomed her with rapture; gave her hand with an affectionate smile to","Pride and Prejudice"
"Wickham, who followed his lady; and wished them both joy, with an","Pride and Prejudice"
"alacrity which showed no doubt of their happiness.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was not quite","Pride and Prejudice"
"so cordial. His countenance rather gained in austerity; and he scarcely","Pride and Prejudice"
"opened his lips. The easy assurance of the young couple, indeed, was","Pride and Prejudice"
"enough to provoke him.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth was disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked. Lydia was","Pride and Prejudice"
"Lydia still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless. She turned","Pride and Prejudice"
"from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations; and when at","Pride and Prejudice"
"length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took notice of","Pride and Prejudice"
"some little alteration in it, and observed, with a laugh, that it was a","Pride and Prejudice"
"great while since she had been there.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself; but his manners","Pride and Prejudice"
"were always so pleasing, that, had his character and his marriage been","Pride and Prejudice"
"exactly what they ought, his smiles and his easy address, while he","Pride and Prejudice"
"claimed their relationship, would have delighted them all. Elizabeth","Pride and Prejudice"
"had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance; but she sat","Pride and Prejudice"
"down, resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the","Pride and Prejudice"
"impudence of an impudent man. _She_ blushed, and Jane blushed; but the","Pride and Prejudice"
"cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of","Pride and Prejudice"
"colour.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"There was no want of discourse. The bride and her mother could neither","Pride and Prejudice"
"of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to sit near","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth, began inquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood,","Pride and Prejudice"
"with a good-humoured ease, which she felt very unable to equal in her","Pride and Prejudice"
"replies. They seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the","Pride and Prejudice"
"world. Nothing of the past was recollected with pain; and Lydia led","Pride and Prejudice"
"voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for","Pride and Prejudice"
"the world.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Only think of its being three months,” she cried, “since I went away:","Pride and Prejudice"
"it seems but a fortnight, I declare; and yet there have been things","Pride and Prejudice"
"enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went away, I am sure","Pride and Prejudice"
"I had no more idea of being married till I came back again! though I","Pride and Prejudice"
"thought it would be very good fun if I was.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Her father lifted up his eyes, Jane was distressed, Elizabeth looked","Pride and Prejudice"
"expressively at Lydia; but she, who never heard nor saw anything of","Pride and Prejudice"
"which she chose to be insensible, gaily continued,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Oh, mamma, do the people hereabouts know I am married to-day? I was","Pride and Prejudice"
"afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in his curricle,","Pride and Prejudice"
"so I was determined he should know it, and so I let down the side glass","Pride and Prejudice"
"next to him, and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the","Pride and Prejudice"
"window frame, so that he might see the ring, and then I bowed and","Pride and Prejudice"
"smiled like anything.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She got up and ran out of the room;","Pride and Prejudice"
"and returned no more, till she heard them passing through the hall to","Pride and Prejudice"
"the dining-parlour. She then joined them soon enough to see Lydia, with","Pride and Prejudice"
"anxious parade, walk up to her mother’s right hand, and hear her say to","Pride and Prejudice"
"her eldest sister,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Ah, Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a","Pride and Prejudice"
"married woman.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that embarrassment","Pride and Prejudice"
"from which she had been so wholly free at first. Her ease and good","Pride and Prejudice"
"spirits increased. She longed to see Mrs. Philips, the Lucases, and all","Pride and Prejudice"
"their other neighbours, and to hear herself called “Mrs. Wickham” by","Pride and Prejudice"
"each of them; and in the meantime she went after dinner to show her ring","Pride and Prejudice"
"and boast of being married to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Well, mamma,” said she, when they were all returned to the","Pride and Prejudice"
"breakfast-room, “and what do you think of my husband? Is not he a","Pride and Prejudice"
"charming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope they","Pride and Prejudice"
"may have half my good luck. They must all go to Brighton. That is the","Pride and Prejudice"
"place to get husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we did not all go!”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Very true; and if I had my will we should. But, my dear Lydia, I don’t","Pride and Prejudice"
"at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Oh, Lord! yes; there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all things.","Pride and Prejudice"
"You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us. We shall be at","Pride and Prejudice"
"Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there will be some balls, and I","Pride and Prejudice"
"will take care to get good partners for them all.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I should like it beyond anything!” said her mother.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my sisters","Pride and Prejudice"
"behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them before the","Pride and Prejudice"
"winter is over.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I thank you for my share of the favour,” said Elizabeth; “but I do not","Pride and Prejudice"
"particularly like your way of getting husbands.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr. Wickham","Pride and Prejudice"
"had received his commission before he left London, and he was to join","Pride and Prejudice"
"his regiment at the end of a fortnight.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so short; and","Pride and Prejudice"
"she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"having very frequent parties at home. These parties were acceptable to","Pride and Prejudice"
"all; to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did","Pride and Prejudice"
"think than such as did not.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Wickham’s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had expected to","Pride and Prejudice"
"find it; not equal to Lydia’s for him. She had scarcely needed her","Pride and Prejudice"
"present observation to be satisfied, from the reason of things, that","Pride and Prejudice"
"their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather","Pride and Prejudice"
"than by his; and she would have wondered why, without violently caring","Pride and Prejudice"
"for her, he chose to elope with her at all, had she not felt certain","Pride and Prejudice"
"that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and","Pride and Prejudice"
"if that were the case, he was not the young man to resist an opportunity","Pride and Prejudice"
"of having a companion.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Lydia was exceedingly fond of him. He was her dear Wickham on every","Pride and Prejudice"
"occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him. He did","Pride and Prejudice"
"everything best in the world; and she was sure he would kill more birds","Pride and Prejudice"
"on the first of September than anybody else in the country.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"One morning, soon after their arrival, as she was sitting with her two","Pride and Prejudice"
"elder sisters, she said to Elizabeth,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe. You were","Pride and Prejudice"
"not by, when I told mamma, and the others, all about it. Are not you","Pride and Prejudice"
"curious to hear how it was managed?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“No, really,” replied Elizabeth; “I think there cannot be too little","Pride and Prejudice"
"said on the subject.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We were","Pride and Prejudice"
"married, you know, at St. Clement’s, because Wickham’s lodgings were in","Pride and Prejudice"
"that parish. And it was settled that we should all be there by eleven","Pride and Prejudice"
"o’clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to go together; and the others","Pride and Prejudice"
"were to meet us at the church.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Well, Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid,","Pride and Prejudice"
"you know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I should","Pride and Prejudice"
"have gone quite distracted. And there was my aunt, all the time I was","Pride and Prejudice"
"dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a","Pride and Prejudice"
"sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in ten, for I was","Pride and Prejudice"
"thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I longed to know whether","Pride and Prejudice"
"he would be married in his blue coat.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual: I thought it would never","Pride and Prejudice"
"be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand that my uncle and aunt","Pride and Prejudice"
"were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with them. If you’ll believe","Pride and Prejudice"
"me, I did not once put my foot out of doors, though I was there a","Pride and Prejudice"
"fortnight. Not one party, or scheme, or anything! To be sure, London was","Pride and Prejudice"
"rather thin, but, however, the Little Theatre was open.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Well, and so, just as the carriage came to the door, my uncle was","Pride and Prejudice"
"called away upon business to that horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you","Pride and Prejudice"
"know, when once they get together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so","Pride and Prejudice"
"frightened I did not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away;","Pride and Prejudice"
"and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day. But,","Pride and Prejudice"
"luckily, he came back again in ten minutes’ time, and then we all set","Pride and Prejudice"
"out. However, I recollected afterwards, that if he _had_ been prevented","Pride and Prejudice"
"going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy might have done as","Pride and Prejudice"
"well.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Mr. Darcy!” repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Oh, yes! he was to come there with Wickham, you know. But, gracious me!","Pride and Prejudice"
"I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word about it. I promised","Pride and Prejudice"
"them so faithfully! What will Wickham say? It was to be such a secret!”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“If it was to be a secret,” said Jane, “say not another word on the","Pride and Prejudice"
"subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Oh, certainly,” said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity; “we will","Pride and Prejudice"
"ask you no questions.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Thank you,” said Lydia; “for if you did, I should certainly tell you","Pride and Prejudice"
"all, and then Wickham would be so angry.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out of her","Pride and Prejudice"
"power, by running away.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at least it","Pride and Prejudice"
"was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had been at her","Pride and Prejudice"
"sister’s wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly among people,","Pride and Prejudice"
"where he had apparently least to do, and least temptation to go.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and wild, hurried into her","Pride and Prejudice"
"brain; but she was satisfied with none. Those that best pleased her, as","Pride and Prejudice"
"placing his conduct in the noblest light, seemed most improbable. She","Pride and Prejudice"
"could not bear such suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper,","Pride and Prejudice"
"wrote a short letter to her aunt, to request an explanation of what","Pride and Prejudice"
"Lydia had dropped, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been","Pride and Prejudice"
"intended.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You may readily comprehend,” she added, “what my curiosity must be to","Pride and Prejudice"
"know how a person unconnected with any of us, and, comparatively","Pride and Prejudice"
"speaking, a stranger to our family, should have been amongst you at such","Pride and Prejudice"
"a time. Pray write instantly, and let me understand it--unless it is,","Pride and Prejudice"
"for very cogent reasons, to remain in the secrecy which Lydia seems to","Pride and Prejudice"
"think necessary; and then I must endeavour to be satisfied with","Pride and Prejudice"
"ignorance.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Not that I _shall_, though,” she added to herself, and she finished the","Pride and Prejudice"
"letter; “and, my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in an honourable","Pride and Prejudice"
"manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it","Pride and Prejudice"
"out.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Jane’s delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to","Pride and Prejudice"

"hurrying into the little copse, where she was least likely to be","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“My dear Niece,","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"     “I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole","Pride and Prejudice"
"     morning to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing will","Pride and Prejudice"
"     not comprise what I have to tell you. I must confess myself","Pride and Prejudice"
"     surprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_.","Pride and Prejudice"
"     Don’t think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know,","Pride and Prejudice"
"     that I had not imagined such inquiries to be necessary on _your_","Pride and Prejudice"
"     side. If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my","Pride and Prejudice"
"     impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised as I am; and nothing","Pride and Prejudice"
"     but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed","Pride and Prejudice"
"     him to act as he has done. But if you are really innocent and","Pride and Prejudice"
"     ignorant, I must be more explicit. On the very day of my coming","Pride and Prejudice"
"     home from Longbourn, your uncle had a most unexpected visitor. Mr.","Pride and Prejudice"
"     Darcy called, and was shut up with him several hours. It was all","Pride and Prejudice"
"     over before I arrived; so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked","Pride and Prejudice"
"     as _yours_ seems to have been. He came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he","Pride and Prejudice"
"     had found out where your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he","Pride and Prejudice"
"     had seen and talked with them both--Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once.","Pride and Prejudice"
"     From what I can collect, he left Derbyshire only one day after","Pride and Prejudice"
"     ourselves, and came to town with the resolution of hunting for","Pride and Prejudice"
"     them. The motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to","Pride and Prejudice"
"     himself that Wickham’s worthlessness had not been so well known as","Pride and Prejudice"
"     to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or","Pride and Prejudice"
"     confide in him. He generously imputed the whole to his mistaken","Pride and Prejudice"
"     pride, and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to","Pride and Prejudice"
"     lay his private actions open to the world. His character was to","Pride and Prejudice"
"     speak for itself. He called it, therefore, his duty to step","Pride and Prejudice"
"     forward, and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on","Pride and Prejudice"
"     by himself. If he _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never","Pride and Prejudice"
"     disgrace him. He had been some days in town before he was able to","Pride and Prejudice"
"     discover them; but he had something to direct his search, which was","Pride and Prejudice"
"     more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this was another","Pride and Prejudice"
"     reason for his resolving to follow us. There is a lady, it seems, a","Pride and Prejudice"
"     Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago governess to Miss Darcy, and was","Pride and Prejudice"
"     dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation, though","Pride and Prejudice"
"     he did not say what. She then took a large house in Edward Street,","Pride and Prejudice"
"     and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs.","Pride and Prejudice"
"     Younge was, he knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he","Pride and Prejudice"
"     went to her for intelligence of him, as soon as he got to town. But","Pride and Prejudice"
"     it was two or three days before he could get from her what he","Pride and Prejudice"
"     wanted. She would not betray her trust, I suppose, without bribery","Pride and Prejudice"
"     and corruption, for she really did know where her friend was to be","Pride and Prejudice"
"     found. Wickham, indeed, had gone to her on their first arrival in","Pride and Prejudice"
"     London; and had she been able to receive them into her house, they","Pride and Prejudice"
"     would have taken up their abode with her. At length, however, our","Pride and Prejudice"
"     kind friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in ----","Pride and Prejudice"
"     Street. He saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia.","Pride and Prejudice"
"     His first object with her, he acknowledged, had been to persuade","Pride and Prejudice"
"     her to quit her present disgraceful situation, and return to her","Pride and Prejudice"
"     friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her,","Pride and Prejudice"
"     offering his assistance as far as it would go. But he found Lydia","Pride and Prejudice"
"     absolutely resolved on remaining where she was. She cared for none","Pride and Prejudice"
"     of her friends; she wanted no help of his; she would not hear of","Pride and Prejudice"
"     leaving Wickham. She was sure they should be married some time or","Pride and Prejudice"
"     other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were her","Pride and Prejudice"
"     feelings, it only remained, he thought, to secure and expedite a","Pride and Prejudice"
"     marriage, which, in his very first conversation with Wickham, he","Pride and Prejudice"
"     easily learnt had never been _his_ design. He confessed himself","Pride and Prejudice"
"     obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour","Pride and Prejudice"
"     which were very pressing; and scrupled not to lay all the ill","Pride and Prejudice"
"     consequences of Lydia’s flight on her own folly alone. He meant to","Pride and Prejudice"
"     resign his commission immediately; and as to his future situation,","Pride and Prejudice"
"     he could conjecture very little about it. He must go somewhere, but","Pride and Prejudice"
"     he did not know where, and he knew he should have nothing to live","Pride and Prejudice"
"     on. Mr. Darcy asked why he did not marry your sister at once.","Pride and Prejudice"
"     Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he would have","Pride and Prejudice"
"     been able to do something for him, and his situation must have been","Pride and Prejudice"
"     benefited by marriage. But he found, in reply to this question,","Pride and Prejudice"
"     that Wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making","Pride and Prejudice"
"     his fortune by marriage, in some other country. Under such","Pride and Prejudice"
"     circumstances, however, he was not likely to be proof against the","Pride and Prejudice"
"     temptation of immediate relief. They met several times, for there","Pride and Prejudice"
"     was much to be discussed. Wickham, of course, wanted more than he","Pride and Prejudice"
"     could get; but at length was reduced to be reasonable. Everything","Pride and Prejudice"
"     being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy’s next step was to make","Pride and Prejudice"
"     your uncle acquainted with it, and he first called in Gracechurch","Pride and Prejudice"
"     Street the evening before I came home. But Mr. Gardiner could not","Pride and Prejudice"
"     be seen; and Mr. Darcy found, on further inquiry, that your father","Pride and Prejudice"
"     was still with him, but would quit town the next morning. He did","Pride and Prejudice"
"     not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly","Pride and Prejudice"
"     consult as your uncle, and therefore readily postponed seeing him","Pride and Prejudice"
"     till after the departure of the former. He did not leave his name,","Pride and Prejudice"
"     and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called","Pride and Prejudice"
"     on business. On Saturday he came again. Your father was gone, your","Pride and Prejudice"
"     uncle at home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk","Pride and Prejudice"
"     together. They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him too. It","Pride and Prejudice"
"     was not all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express","Pride and Prejudice"
"     was sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I","Pride and Prejudice"
"     fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his character,","Pride and Prejudice"
"     after all. He has been accused of many faults at different times;","Pride and Prejudice"
"     but _this_ is the true one. Nothing was to be done that he did not","Pride and Prejudice"
"     do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be thanked,","Pride and Prejudice"
"     therefore say nothing about it) your uncle would most readily have","Pride and Prejudice"
"     settled the whole. They battled it together for a long time, which","Pride and Prejudice"
"     was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it","Pride and Prejudice"
"     deserved. But at last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead","Pride and Prejudice"
"     of being allowed to be of use to his niece, was forced to put up","Pride and Prejudice"
"     with only having the probable credit of it, which went sorely","Pride and Prejudice"
"     against the grain; and I really believe your letter this morning","Pride and Prejudice"
"     gave him great pleasure, because it required an explanation that","Pride and Prejudice"
"     would rob him of his borrowed feathers, and give the praise where","Pride and Prejudice"
"     it was due. But, Lizzy, this must go no further than yourself, or","Pride and Prejudice"
"     Jane at most. You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done","Pride and Prejudice"
"     for the young people. His debts are to be paid, amounting, I","Pride and Prejudice"
"     believe, to considerably more than a thousand pounds, another","Pride and Prejudice"
"     thousand in addition to her own settled upon _her_, and his","Pride and Prejudice"
"     commission purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him","Pride and Prejudice"
"     alone, was such as I have given above. It was owing to him, to his","Pride and Prejudice"
"     reserve and want of proper consideration, that Wickham’s character","Pride and Prejudice"
"     had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he had been","Pride and Prejudice"
"     received and noticed as he was. Perhaps there was some truth in","Pride and Prejudice"
"     _this_; though I doubt whether _his_ reserve, or _anybody’s_","Pride and Prejudice"
"     reserve can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all this","Pride and Prejudice"
"     fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured that","Pride and Prejudice"
"     your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him credit","Pride and Prejudice"
"     for _another interest_ in the affair. When all this was resolved","Pride and Prejudice"
"     on, he returned again to his friends, who were still staying at","Pride and Prejudice"
"     Pemberley; but it was agreed that he should be in London once more","Pride and Prejudice"
"     when the wedding took place, and all money matters were then to","Pride and Prejudice"
"     receive the last finish. I believe I have now told you everything.","Pride and Prejudice"
"     It is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I","Pride and Prejudice"
"     hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to","Pride and Prejudice"
"     us, and Wickham had constant admission to the house. _He_ was","Pride and Prejudice"
"     exactly what he had been when I knew him in Hertfordshire; but I","Pride and Prejudice"
"     would not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her_ behaviour","Pride and Prejudice"
"     while she stayed with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane’s letter","Pride and Prejudice"
"     last Wednesday, that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a","Pride and Prejudice"
"     piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you no","Pride and Prejudice"
"     fresh pain. I talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner,","Pride and Prejudice"
"     representing to her the wickedness of what she had done, and all","Pride and Prejudice"
"     the unhappiness she had brought on her family. If she heard me, it","Pride and Prejudice"
"     was by good luck, for I am sure she did not listen. I was sometimes","Pride and Prejudice"
"     quite provoked; but then I recollected my dear Elizabeth and Jane,","Pride and Prejudice"
"     and for their sakes had patience with her. Mr. Darcy was punctual","Pride and Prejudice"
"     in his return, and, as Lydia imformed you, attended the wedding. He","Pride and Prejudice"
"     dined with us the next day, and was to leave town again on","Pride and Prejudice"
"     Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry with me, my dear","Pride and Prejudice"
"     Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying (what I was never bold","Pride and Prejudice"
"     enough to say before) how much I like him? His behaviour to us has,","Pride and Prejudice"
"     in every respect, been as pleasing as when we were in Derbyshire.","Pride and Prejudice"
"     His understanding and opinions all please me; he wants nothing but","Pride and Prejudice"
"     a little more liveliness, and _that_, if he marry _prudently_, his","Pride and Prejudice"
"     wife may teach him. I thought him very sly; he hardly ever","Pride and Prejudice"
"     mentioned your name. But slyness seems the fashion. Pray forgive","Pride and Prejudice"
"     me, if I have been very presuming, or at least do not punish me so","Pride and Prejudice"
"     far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be quite happy till I","Pride and Prejudice"
"     have been all round the park. A low phaeton with a nice little pair","Pride and Prejudice"
"     of ponies would be the very thing. But I must write no more. The","Pride and Prejudice"
"     children have been wanting me this half hour.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yours, very sincerely,","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“M. GARDINER.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of spirits,","Pride and Prejudice"
"in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the","Pride and Prejudice"
"greatest share. The vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had","Pride and Prejudice"
"produced, of what Mr. Darcy might have been doing to forward her","Pride and Prejudice"
"sister’s match--which she had feared to encourage, as an exertion of","Pride and Prejudice"
"goodness too great to be probable, and at the same time dreaded to be","Pride and Prejudice"
"just, from the pain of obligation--were proved beyond their greatest","Pride and Prejudice"
"extent to be true! He had followed them purposely to town, he had taken","Pride and Prejudice"
"on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a","Pride and Prejudice"
"research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he","Pride and Prejudice"
"must abominate and despise, and where he was reduced to meet, frequently","Pride and Prejudice"
"meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe the man whom he always","Pride and Prejudice"
"most wished to avoid, and whose very name it was punishment to him to","Pride and Prejudice"
"pronounce. He had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard","Pride and Prejudice"
"nor esteem. Her heart did whisper that he had done it for her. But it","Pride and Prejudice"
"was a hope shortly checked by other considerations; and she soon felt","Pride and Prejudice"
"that even her vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his","Pride and Prejudice"
"affection for her, for a woman who had already refused him, as able to","Pride and Prejudice"
"overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with","Pride and Prejudice"
"Wickham. Brother-in-law of Wickham! Every kind of pride must revolt from","Pride and Prejudice"
"the connection. He had, to be sure, done much. She was ashamed to think","Pride and Prejudice"
"how much. But he had given a reason for his interference, which asked no","Pride and Prejudice"
"extraordinary stretch of belief. It was reasonable that he should feel","Pride and Prejudice"
"he had been wrong; he had liberality, and he had the means of exercising","Pride and Prejudice"
"it; and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement,","Pride and Prejudice"
"she could perhaps believe, that remaining partiality for her might","Pride and Prejudice"
"assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be","Pride and Prejudice"
"materially concerned. It was painful, exceedingly painful, to know that","Pride and Prejudice"
"they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a","Pride and Prejudice"
"return. They owed the restoration of Lydia, her character, everything to","Pride and Prejudice"
"him. Oh, how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she","Pride and Prejudice"
"had ever encouraged, every saucy speech she had ever directed towards","Pride and Prejudice"
"him! For herself she was humbled; but she was proud of him,--proud that","Pride and Prejudice"
"in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better","Pride and Prejudice"
"of himself. She read over her aunt’s commendation of him again and","Pride and Prejudice"
"again. It was hardly enough; but it pleased her. She was even sensible","Pride and Prejudice"
"of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding how steadfastly","Pride and Prejudice"
"both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence","Pride and Prejudice"
"subsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She was roused from her seat and her reflections, by someone’s approach;","Pride and Prejudice"
"and, before she could strike into another path, she was overtaken by","Pride and Prejudice"
"Wickham.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?” said he,","Pride and Prejudice"
"as he joined her.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You certainly do,” she replied with a smile; “but it does not follow","Pride and Prejudice"
"that the interruption must be unwelcome.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I should be sorry, indeed, if it were. _We_ were always good friends,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and now we are better.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“True. Are the others coming out?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage to","Pride and Prejudice"
"Meryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and aunt, that","Pride and Prejudice"
"you have actually seen Pemberley.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She replied in the affirmative.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be too much","Pride and Prejudice"
"for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle. And you saw the","Pride and Prejudice"
"old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she was always very fond of","Pride and Prejudice"
"me. But of course she did not mention my name to you.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yes, she did.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“And what did she say?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“That you were gone into the army, and she was afraid had--not turned","Pride and Prejudice"
"out well. At such a distance as _that_, you know, things are strangely","Pride and Prejudice"
"misrepresented.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Certainly,” he replied, biting his lips. Elizabeth hoped she had","Pride and Prejudice"
"silenced him; but he soon afterwards said,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each other","Pride and Prejudice"
"several times. I wonder what he can be doing there.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Perhaps preparing for his marriage with Miss de Bourgh,” said","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth. “It must be something particular to take him there at this","Pride and Prejudice"
"time of year.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Undoubtedly. Did you see him while you were at Lambton? I thought I","Pride and Prejudice"
"understood from the Gardiners that you had.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yes; he introduced us to his sister.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“And do you like her?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Very much.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I have heard, indeed, that she is uncommonly improved within this year","Pride and Prejudice"
"or two. When I last saw her, she was not very promising. I am very glad","Pride and Prejudice"
"you liked her. I hope she will turn out well.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I dare say she will; she has got over the most trying age.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Did you go by the village of Kympton?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I do not recollect that we did.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I mention it because it is the living which I ought to have had. A most","Pride and Prejudice"
"delightful place! Excellent parsonage-house! It would have suited me in","Pride and Prejudice"
"every respect.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“How should you have liked making sermons?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my duty, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought not to repine; but,","Pride and Prejudice"
"to be sure, it would have been such a thing for me! The quiet, the","Pride and Prejudice"
"retirement of such a life, would have answered all my ideas of","Pride and Prejudice"
"happiness! But it was not to be. Did you ever hear Darcy mention the","Pride and Prejudice"
"circumstance when you were in Kent?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I _have_ heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that it was","Pride and Prejudice"
"left you conditionally only, and at the will of the present patron.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You have! Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from the","Pride and Prejudice"
"first, you may remember.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time when sermon-making was not so","Pride and Prejudice"
"palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you actually","Pride and Prejudice"
"declared your resolution of never taking orders, and that the business","Pride and Prejudice"
"had been compromised accordingly.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may remember","Pride and Prejudice"
"what I told you on that point, when first we talked of it.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"They were now almost at the door of the house, for she had walked fast","Pride and Prejudice"
"to get rid of him; and unwilling, for her sister’s sake, to provoke him,","Pride and Prejudice"
"she only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not let us","Pride and Prejudice"
"quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be always of one","Pride and Prejudice"

"[Illustration]","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation, that he","Pride and Prejudice"
"never again distressed himself, or provoked his dear sister Elizabeth,","Pride and Prejudice"
"by introducing the subject of it; and she was pleased to find that she","Pride and Prejudice"
"had said enough to keep him quiet.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The day of his and Lydia’s departure soon came; and Mrs. Bennet was","Pride and Prejudice"
"forced to submit to a separation, which, as her husband by no means","Pride and Prejudice"
"entered into her scheme of their all going to Newcastle, was likely to","Pride and Prejudice"
"continue at least a twelvemonth.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Oh, my dear Lydia,” she cried, “when shall we meet again?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Oh, Lord! I don’t know. Not these two or three years, perhaps.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Write to me very often, my dear.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“As often as I can. But you know married women have never much time for","Pride and Prejudice"
"writing. My sisters may write to _me_. They will have nothing else to","Pride and Prejudice"
"do.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Wickham’s adieus were much more affectionate than his wife’s. He","Pride and Prejudice"
"smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“He is as fine a fellow,” said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were out of","Pride and Prejudice"
"the house, “as ever I saw. He simpers, and smirks, and makes love to us","Pride and Prejudice"
"all. I am prodigiously proud of him. I defy even Sir William Lucas","Pride and Prejudice"
"himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The loss of her daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several days.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I often think,” said she, “that there is nothing so bad as parting with","Pride and Prejudice"
"one’s friends. One seems so forlorn without them.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“This is the consequence, you see, madam, of marrying a daughter,” said","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth. “It must make you better satisfied that your other four are","Pride and Prejudice"
"single.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she is married;","Pride and Prejudice"
"but only because her husband’s regiment happens to be so far off. If","Pride and Prejudice"
"that had been nearer, she would not have gone so soon.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"But the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly","Pride and Prejudice"
"relieved, and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope, by an","Pride and Prejudice"
"article of news which then began to be in circulation. The housekeeper","Pride and Prejudice"
"at Netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her","Pride and Prejudice"
"master, who was coming down in a day or two, to shoot there for several","Pride and Prejudice"
"weeks. Mrs. Bennet was quite in the fidgets. She looked at Jane, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"smiled, and shook her head, by turns.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,” (for Mrs.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Philips first brought her the news). “Well, so much the better. Not that","Pride and Prejudice"
"I care about it, though. He is nothing to us, you know, and I am sure I","Pride and Prejudice"
"never want to see him again. But, however, he is very welcome to come to","Pride and Prejudice"
"Netherfield, if he likes it. And who knows what _may_ happen? But that","Pride and Prejudice"
"is nothing to us. You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention","Pride and Prejudice"
"a word about it. And so, it is quite certain he is coming?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You may depend on it,” replied the other, “for Mrs. Nichols was in","Pride and Prejudice"
"Meryton last night: I saw her passing by, and went out myself on purpose","Pride and Prejudice"
"to know the truth of it; and she told me that it was certainly true. He","Pride and Prejudice"
"comes down on Thursday, at the latest, very likely on Wednesday. She was","Pride and Prejudice"
"going to the butcher’s, she told me, on purpose to order in some meat on","Pride and Prejudice"
"Wednesday, and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing","Pride and Prejudice"
"colour. It was many months since she had mentioned his name to","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together, she said,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the present","Pride and Prejudice"
"report; and I know I appeared distressed; but don’t imagine it was from","Pride and Prejudice"
"any silly cause. I was only confused for the moment, because I felt that","Pride and Prejudice"
"I _should_ be looked at. I do assure you that the news does not affect","Pride and Prejudice"
"me either with pleasure or pain. I am glad of one thing, that he comes","Pride and Prejudice"
"alone; because we shall see the less of him. Not that I am afraid of","Pride and Prejudice"
"_myself_, but I dread other people’s remarks.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she not seen him in","Pride and Prejudice"
"Derbyshire, she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no","Pride and Prejudice"
"other view than what was acknowledged; but she still thought him partial","Pride and Prejudice"
"to Jane, and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming","Pride and Prejudice"
"there _with_ his friend’s permission, or being bold enough to come","Pride and Prejudice"
"without it.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yet it is hard,” she sometimes thought, “that this poor man cannot come","Pride and Prejudice"
"to a house, which he has legally hired, without raising all this","Pride and Prejudice"
"speculation! I _will_ leave him to himself.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"In spite of what her sister declared, and really believed to be her","Pride and Prejudice"
"feelings, in the expectation of his arrival, Elizabeth could easily","Pride and Prejudice"
"perceive that her spirits were affected by it. They were more disturbed,","Pride and Prejudice"
"more unequal, than she had often seen them.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their parents,","Pride and Prejudice"
"about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “you","Pride and Prejudice"
"will wait on him, of course.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“No, no. You forced me into visiting him last year, and promised, if I","Pride and Prejudice"
"went to see him, he should marry one of my daughters. But it ended in","Pride and Prejudice"
"nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool’s errand again.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"His wife represented to him how absolutely necessary such an attention","Pride and Prejudice"
"would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his returning to","Pride and Prejudice"
"Netherfield.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“’Tis an _etiquette_ I despise,” said he. “If he wants our society, let","Pride and Prejudice"
"him seek it. He knows where we live. I will not spend _my_ hours in","Pride and Prejudice"
"running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back","Pride and Prejudice"
"again.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait","Pride and Prejudice"
"on him. But, however, that shan’t prevent my asking him to dine here, I","Pride and Prejudice"
"am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the Gouldings soon. That will","Pride and Prejudice"
"make thirteen with ourselves, so there will be just room at table for","Pride and Prejudice"
"him.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Consoled by this resolution, she was the better able to bear her","Pride and Prejudice"
"husband’s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that her","Pride and Prejudice"
"neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it, before","Pride and Prejudice"
"_they_ did. As the day of his arrival drew near,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I begin to be sorry that he comes at all,” said Jane to her sister. “It","Pride and Prejudice"
"would be nothing; I could see him with perfect indifference; but I can","Pride and Prejudice"
"hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of. My mother means well;","Pride and Prejudice"
"but she does not know, no one can know, how much I suffer from what she","Pride and Prejudice"
"says. Happy shall I be when his stay at Netherfield is over!”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I wish I could say anything to comfort you,” replied Elizabeth; “but it","Pride and Prejudice"
"is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the usual satisfaction","Pride and Prejudice"
"of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me, because you have","Pride and Prejudice"
"always so much.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of servants,","Pride and Prejudice"
"contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the period of anxiety","Pride and Prejudice"
"and fretfulness on her side be as long as it could. She counted the days","Pride and Prejudice"
"that must intervene before their invitation could be sent--hopeless of","Pride and Prejudice"
"seeing him before. But on the third morning after his arrival in","Pride and Prejudice"
"Hertfordshire, she saw him from her dressing-room window enter the","Pride and Prejudice"
"paddock, and ride towards the house.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy. Jane resolutely","Pride and Prejudice"
"kept her place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy her mother, went","Pride and Prejudice"
"to the window--she looked--she saw Mr. Darcy with him, and sat down","Pride and Prejudice"
"again by her sister.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“There is a gentleman with him, mamma,” said Kitty; “who can it be?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do not","Pride and Prejudice"

"after receiving his explanatory letter. Both sisters were uncomfortable","Pride and Prejudice"
"enough. Each felt for the other, and of course for themselves; and their","Pride and Prejudice"

"civil to him only as Mr. Bingley’s friend, without being heard by either","Pride and Prejudice"

"for the first of benefits, and whom she regarded herself with an","Pride and Prejudice"

"what Jane felt for Bingley. Her astonishment at his coming--at his","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"

"minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added lustre to","Pride and Prejudice"

"wishes must still be unshaken; but she would not be secure.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Let me first see how he behaves,” said she; “it will then be early","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"

"paler than usual, but more sedate than Elizabeth had expected. On the","Pride and Prejudice"
"gentlemen’s appearing, her colour increased; yet she received them with","Pride and Prejudice"
"tolerable ease, and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any","Pride and Prejudice"
"symptom of resentment, or any unnecessary complaisance.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and sat down","Pride and Prejudice"
"again to her work, with an eagerness which it did not often command. She","Pride and Prejudice"
"had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He looked serious as usual; and,","Pride and Prejudice"
"she thought, more as he had been used to look in Hertfordshire, than as","Pride and Prejudice"
"she had seen him at Pemberley. But, perhaps, he could not in her","Pride and Prejudice"
"mother’s presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt. It was a","Pride and Prejudice"
"painful, but not an improbable, conjecture.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bingley she had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short period","Pride and Prejudice"
"saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed. He was received by Mrs.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed,","Pride and Prejudice"
"especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of","Pride and Prejudice"
"her courtesy and address of his friend.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth particularly, who knew that her mother owed to the latter the","Pride and Prejudice"
"preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy, was","Pride and Prejudice"
"hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill","Pride and Prejudice"
"applied.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Darcy, after inquiring of her how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did--a question","Pride and Prejudice"
"which she could not answer without confusion--said scarcely anything. He","Pride and Prejudice"
"was not seated by her: perhaps that was the reason of his silence; but","Pride and Prejudice"
"it had not been so in Derbyshire. There he had talked to her friends","Pride and Prejudice"
"when he could not to herself. But now several minutes elapsed, without","Pride and Prejudice"
"bringing the sound of his voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist","Pride and Prejudice"
"the impulse of curiosity, she raised her eyes to his face, she as often","Pride and Prejudice"
"found him looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object but","Pride and Prejudice"
"the ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please, than when","Pride and Prejudice"
"they last met, were plainly expressed. She was disappointed, and angry","Pride and Prejudice"
"with herself for being so.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Could I expect it to be otherwise?” said she. “Yet why did he come?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself; and to","Pride and Prejudice"
"him she had hardly courage to speak.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She inquired after his sister, but could do no more.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,” said Mrs. Bennet.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"He readily agreed to it.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People _did_ say,","Pride and Prejudice"
"you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas; but, however, I hope","Pride and Prejudice"
"it is not true. A great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood","Pride and Prejudice"
"since you went away. Miss Lucas is married and settled: and one of my","Pride and Prejudice"
"own daughters. I suppose you have heard of it; indeed, you must have","Pride and Prejudice"
"seen it in the papers. It was in the ‘Times’ and the ‘Courier,’ I know;","Pride and Prejudice"
"though it was not put in as it ought to be. It was only said, ‘Lately,","Pride and Prejudice"
"George Wickham, Esq., to Miss Lydia Bennet,’ without there being a","Pride and Prejudice"
"syllable said of her father, or the place where she lived, or anything.","Pride and Prejudice"
"It was my brother Gardiner’s drawing up, too, and I wonder how he came","Pride and Prejudice"
"to make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bingley replied that he did, and made his congratulations. Elizabeth","Pride and Prejudice"
"dared not lift up her eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked, therefore, she could","Pride and Prejudice"
"not tell.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well married,”","Pride and Prejudice"
"continued her mother; “but at the same time, Mr. Bingley, it is very","Pride and Prejudice"
"hard to have her taken away from me. They are gone down to Newcastle, a","Pride and Prejudice"
"place quite northward it seems, and there they are to stay, I do not","Pride and Prejudice"
"know how long. His regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of","Pride and Prejudice"
"his leaving the ----shire, and of his being gone into the Regulars.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Thank heaven! he has _some_ friends, though, perhaps, not so many as he","Pride and Prejudice"
"deserves.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such misery","Pride and Prejudice"
"of shame that she could hardly keep her seat. It drew from her, however,","Pride and Prejudice"
"the exertion of speaking, which nothing else had so effectually done","Pride and Prejudice"
"before; and she asked Bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the","Pride and Prejudice"
"country at present. A few weeks, he believed.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,” said her mother,","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on Mr.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bennet’s manor. I am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"will save all the best of the coveys for you.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth’s misery increased at such unnecessary, such officious","Pride and Prejudice"
"attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present, as had","Pride and Prejudice"
"flattered them a year ago, everything, she was persuaded, would be","Pride and Prejudice"
"hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant she felt,","Pride and Prejudice"
"that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself amends for","Pride and Prejudice"
"moments of such painful confusion.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“The first wish of my heart,” said she to herself, “is never more to be","Pride and Prejudice"
"in company with either of them. Their society can afford no pleasure","Pride and Prejudice"
"that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me never see either","Pride and Prejudice"
"one or the other again!”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no","Pride and Prejudice"
"compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from observing","Pride and Prejudice"
"how much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her former","Pride and Prejudice"
"lover. When first he came in, he had spoken to her but little, but every","Pride and Prejudice"
"five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention. He found her","Pride and Prejudice"
"as handsome as she had been last year; as good-natured, and as","Pride and Prejudice"
"unaffected, though not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no","Pride and Prejudice"
"difference should be perceived in her at all, and was really persuaded","Pride and Prejudice"
"that she talked as much as ever; but her mind was so busily engaged,","Pride and Prejudice"
"that she did not always know when she was silent.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of her","Pride and Prejudice"
"intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine at","Pride and Prejudice"
"Longbourn in a few days’ time.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,” she added; “for when","Pride and Prejudice"
"you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family dinner with","Pride and Prejudice"
"us as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you see; and I assure you","Pride and Prejudice"
"I was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your","Pride and Prejudice"
"engagement.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said something of","Pride and Prejudice"

"As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits;","Pride and Prejudice"
"or, in other words, to dwell without interruption on those subjects","Pride and Prejudice"
"which must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy’s behaviour astonished and vexed","Pride and Prejudice"
"her.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Why, if he came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,” said she,","Pride and Prejudice"
"“did he come at all?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“He could be still amiable, still pleasing to my uncle and aunt, when he","Pride and Prejudice"
"was in town; and why not to me? If he fears me, why come hither? If he","Pride and Prejudice"
"no longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing, teasing man! I will think","Pride and Prejudice"
"no more about him.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach","Pride and Prejudice"
"of her sister, who joined her with a cheerful look which showed her","Pride and Prejudice"
"better satisfied with their visitors than Elizabeth.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Now,” said she, “that this first meeting is over, I feel perfectly","Pride and Prejudice"
"easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be embarrassed again by","Pride and Prejudice"
"his coming. I am glad he dines here on Tuesday. It will then be publicly","Pride and Prejudice"
"seen, that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent","Pride and Prejudice"
"acquaintance.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yes, very indifferent, indeed,” said Elizabeth, laughingly. “Oh, Jane!","Pride and Prejudice"
"take care.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak as to be in danger now.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I think you are in very great danger of making him as much in love with","Pride and Prejudice"
"you as ever.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs. Bennet, in","Pride and Prejudice"
"the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy schemes which the","Pride and Prejudice"
"good-humour and common politeness of Bingley, in half an hour’s visit,","Pride and Prejudice"
"had revived.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and the two","Pride and Prejudice"
"who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their punctuality as","Pride and Prejudice"
"sportsmen, were in very good time. When they repaired to the","Pride and Prejudice"
"dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take","Pride and Prejudice"
"the place which, in all their former parties, had belonged to him, by","Pride and Prejudice"
"her sister. Her prudent mother, occupied by the same ideas, forbore to","Pride and Prejudice"
"invite him to sit by herself. On entering the room, he seemed to","Pride and Prejudice"
"hesitate; but Jane happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was","Pride and Prejudice"
"decided. He placed himself by her.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his friend. He","Pride and Prejudice"
"bore it with noble indifference; and she would have imagined that","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bingley had received his sanction to be happy, had she not seen his eyes","Pride and Prejudice"
"likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an expression of half-laughing","Pride and Prejudice"
"alarm.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"His behaviour to her sister was such during dinnertime as showed an","Pride and Prejudice"
"admiration of her, which, though more guarded than formerly, persuaded","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth, that, if left wholly to himself, Jane’s happiness, and his","Pride and Prejudice"
"own, would be speedily secured. Though she dared not depend upon the","Pride and Prejudice"
"consequence, she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour. It","Pride and Prejudice"
"gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast; for she was in","Pride and Prejudice"
"no cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her as the table","Pride and Prejudice"
"could divide them. He was on one side of her mother. She knew how little","Pride and Prejudice"
"such a situation would give pleasure to either, or make either appear to","Pride and Prejudice"
"advantage. She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse; but","Pride and Prejudice"
"she could see how seldom they spoke to each other, and how formal and","Pride and Prejudice"
"cold was their manner whenever they did. Her mother’s ungraciousness","Pride and Prejudice"
"made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth’s mind;","Pride and Prejudice"
"and she would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell","Pride and Prejudice"
"him, that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of","Pride and Prejudice"
"the family.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of","Pride and Prejudice"
"bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not pass away","Pride and Prejudice"
"without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation,","Pride and Prejudice"
"than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance. Anxious and","Pride and Prejudice"
"uneasy, the period which passed in the drawing-room before the gentlemen","Pride and Prejudice"
"came, was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil.","Pride and Prejudice"
"She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her","Pride and Prejudice"
"chance of pleasure for the evening must depend.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“If he does not come to me, _then_,” said she, “I shall give him up for","Pride and Prejudice"
"ever.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The gentlemen came; and she thought he looked as if he would have","Pride and Prejudice"
"answered her hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the table,","Pride and Prejudice"
"where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee,","Pride and Prejudice"
"in so close a confederacy, that there was not a single vacancy near her","Pride and Prejudice"
"which would admit of a chair. And on the gentlemen’s approaching, one of","Pride and Prejudice"
"the girls moved closer to her than ever, and said, in a whisper,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“The men shan’t come and part us, I am determined. We want none of them;","Pride and Prejudice"
"do we?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She followed him with","Pride and Prejudice"
"her eyes, envied everyone to whom he spoke, had scarcely patience enough","Pride and Prejudice"
"to help anybody to coffee, and then was enraged against herself for","Pride and Prejudice"
"being so silly!","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish enough to","Pride and Prejudice"
"expect a renewal of his love? Is there one among the sex who would not","Pride and Prejudice"
"protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman?","Pride and Prejudice"
"There is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She was a little revived, however, by his bringing back his coffee-cup","Pride and Prejudice"
"himself; and she seized the opportunity of saying,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Is your sister at Pemberley still?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yes; she will remain there till Christmas.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“And quite alone? Have all her friends left her?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Mrs. Annesley is with her. The others have been gone on to Scarborough","Pride and Prejudice"
"these three weeks.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She could think of nothing more to say; but if he wished to converse","Pride and Prejudice"
"with her, he might have better success. He stood by her, however, for","Pride and Prejudice"
"some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young lady’s whispering","Pride and Prejudice"
"to Elizabeth again, he walked away.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"When the tea things were removed, and the card tables placed, the ladies","Pride and Prejudice"
"all rose; and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him, when","Pride and Prejudice"
"all her views were overthrown, by seeing him fall a victim to her","Pride and Prejudice"
"mother’s rapacity for whist players, and in a few moments after seated","Pride and Prejudice"
"with the rest of the party. She now lost every expectation of pleasure.","Pride and Prejudice"
"They were confined for the evening at different tables; and she had","Pride and Prejudice"
"nothing to hope, but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side","Pride and Prejudice"
"of the room, as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to","Pride and Prejudice"
"supper; but their carriage was, unluckily, ordered before any of the","Pride and Prejudice"
"others, and she had no opportunity of detaining them.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Well, girls,” said she, as soon as they were left to themselves, “what","Pride and Prejudice"
"say you to the day? I think everything has passed off uncommonly well, I","Pride and Prejudice"
"assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as any I ever saw. The","Pride and Prejudice"
"venison was roasted to a turn--and everybody said, they never saw so fat","Pride and Prejudice"
"a haunch. The soup was fifty times better than what we had at the","Pride and Prejudice"
"Lucases’ last week; and even Mr. Darcy acknowledged that the partridges","Pride and Prejudice"
"were remarkably well done; and I suppose he has two or three French","Pride and Prejudice"
"cooks at least. And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater","Pride and Prejudice"
"beauty. Mrs. Long said so too, for I asked her whether you did not. And","Pride and Prejudice"
"what do you think she said besides? ‘Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have her","Pride and Prejudice"

"into the drawing-room.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mrs. Bennet’s schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was","Pride and Prejudice"
"everything that was charming, except the professed lover of her","Pride and Prejudice"
"daughter. His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable","Pride and Prejudice"
"addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged","Pride and Prejudice"
"officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a","Pride and Prejudice"
"forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the","Pride and Prejudice"
"daughter.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"He scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he went away","Pride and Prejudice"
"an engagement was formed, chiefly through his own and Mrs. Bennet’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"means, for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed","Pride and Prejudice"
"between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in the","Pride and Prejudice"
"happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy","Pride and Prejudice"
"returned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably","Pride and Prejudice"
"persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"concurrence.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the","Pride and Prejudice"
"morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more","Pride and Prejudice"
"agreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption","Pride and Prejudice"
"or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into","Pride and Prejudice"
"silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the","Pride and Prejudice"
"other had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner;","Pride and Prejudice"
"and in the evening Mrs. Bennet’s invention was again at work to get","Pride and Prejudice"
"everybody away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter to","Pride and Prejudice"
"write, went into the breakfast-room for that purpose soon after tea; for","Pride and Prejudice"
"as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be","Pride and Prejudice"
"wanted to counteract her mother’s schemes.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"But on her returning to the drawing-room, when her letter was finished,","Pride and Prejudice"
"she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her","Pride and Prejudice"
"mother had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she","Pride and Prejudice"
"perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as","Pride and Prejudice"
"if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion,","Pride and Prejudice"
"the faces of both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each","Pride and Prejudice"
"other, would have told it all. _Their_ situation was awkward enough; but","Pride and Prejudice"
"_hers_ she thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by","Pride and Prejudice"
"either; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and,","Pride and Prejudice"
"whispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence would give","Pride and Prejudice"
"pleasure; and, instantly embracing her, acknowledged, with the liveliest","Pride and Prejudice"
"emotion, that she was the happiest creature in the world.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“’Tis too much!” she added, “by far too much. I do not deserve it. Oh,","Pride and Prejudice"
"why is not everybody as happy?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth’s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a warmth, a","Pride and Prejudice"
"delight, which words could but poorly express. Every sentence of","Pride and Prejudice"
"kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But she would not","Pride and Prejudice"
"allow herself to stay with her sister, or say half that remained to be","Pride and Prejudice"
"said, for the present.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I must go instantly to my mother,” she cried. “I would not on any","Pride and Prejudice"
"account trifle with her affectionate solicitude, or allow her to hear it","Pride and Prejudice"
"from anyone but myself. He is gone to my father already. Oh, Lizzy, to","Pride and Prejudice"
"know that what I have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear","Pride and Prejudice"
"family! how shall I bear so much happiness?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She then hastened away to her mother, who had purposely broken up the","Pride and Prejudice"
"card-party, and was sitting upstairs with Kitty.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity and ease","Pride and Prejudice"
"with which an affair was finally settled, that had given them so many","Pride and Prejudice"
"previous months of suspense and vexation.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“And this,” said she, “is the end of all his friend’s anxious","Pride and Prejudice"
"circumspection! of all his sister’s falsehood and contrivance! the","Pride and Prejudice"
"happiest, wisest, and most reasonable end!”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"In a few minutes she was joined by Bingley, whose conference with her","Pride and Prejudice"
"father had been short and to the purpose.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Where is your sister?” said he hastily, as he opened the door.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“With my mother upstairs. She will be down in a moment, I dare say.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes","Pride and Prejudice"
"and affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her","Pride and Prejudice"
"delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with","Pride and Prejudice"
"great cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen","Pride and Prejudice"
"to all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane’s perfections;","Pride and Prejudice"
"and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his","Pride and Prejudice"
"expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for","Pride and Prejudice"
"basis the excellent understanding and super-excellent disposition of","Pride and Prejudice"
"Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and","Pride and Prejudice"
"himself.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the satisfaction of","Pride and Prejudice"
"Miss Bennet’s mind gave such a glow of sweet animation to her face, as","Pride and Prejudice"
"made her look handsomer than ever. Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped","Pride and Prejudice"
"her turn was coming soon. Mrs. Bennet could not give her consent, or","Pride and Prejudice"
"speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings,","Pride and Prejudice"
"though she talked to Bingley of nothing else, for half an hour; and when","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Bennet joined them at supper, his voice and manner plainly showed","Pride and Prejudice"
"how really happy he was.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Not a word, however, passed his lips in allusion to it, till their","Pride and Prejudice"
"visitor took his leave for the night; but as soon as he was gone, he","Pride and Prejudice"
"turned to his daughter and said,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Jane went to him instantly, kissed him, and thanked him for his","Pride and Prejudice"
"goodness.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You are a good girl,” he replied, “and I have great pleasure in","Pride and Prejudice"
"thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of your","Pride and Prejudice"
"doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means unlike. You are","Pride and Prejudice"
"each of you so complying, that nothing will ever be resolved on; so","Pride and Prejudice"
"easy, that every servant will cheat you; and so generous, that you will","Pride and Prejudice"
"always exceed your income.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters would be","Pride and Prejudice"
"unpardonable in _me_.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,” cried his wife, “what are you","Pride and Prejudice"
"talking of? Why, he has four or five thousand a year, and very likely","Pride and Prejudice"
"more.” Then addressing her daughter, “Oh, my dear, dear Jane, I am so","Pride and Prejudice"
"happy! I am sure I shan’t get a wink of sleep all night. I knew how it","Pride and Prejudice"
"would be. I always said it must be so, at last. I was sure you could not","Pride and Prejudice"
"be so beautiful for nothing! I remember, as soon as ever I saw him, when","Pride and Prejudice"
"he first came into Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was","Pride and Prejudice"
"that you should come together. Oh, he is the handsomest young man that","Pride and Prejudice"
"ever was seen!”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition her","Pride and Prejudice"
"favourite child. At that moment she cared for no other. Her younger","Pride and Prejudice"
"sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness","Pride and Prejudice"
"which she might in future be able to dispense.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and Kitty","Pride and Prejudice"
"begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at Longbourn;","Pride and Prejudice"
"coming frequently before breakfast, and always remaining till after","Pride and Prejudice"
"supper; unless when some barbarous neighbour, who could not be enough","Pride and Prejudice"
"detested, had given him an invitation to dinner, which he thought","Pride and Prejudice"
"himself obliged to accept.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister; for","Pride and Prejudice"
"while he was present Jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else: but","Pride and Prejudice"
"she found herself considerably useful to both of them, in those hours of","Pride and Prejudice"
"separation that must sometimes occur. In the absence of Jane, he always","Pride and Prejudice"
"attached himself to Elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her; and","Pride and Prejudice"
"when Bingley was gone, Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“He has made me so happy,” said she, one evening, “by telling me that he","Pride and Prejudice"
"was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I had not believed","Pride and Prejudice"
"it possible.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I suspected as much,” replied Elizabeth. “But how did he account for","Pride and Prejudice"
"it?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“It must have been his sisters’ doing. They were certainly no friends to","Pride and Prejudice"
"his acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at, since he might have","Pride and Prejudice"
"chosen so much more advantageously in many respects. But when they see,","Pride and Prejudice"
"as I trust they will, that their brother is happy with me, they will","Pride and Prejudice"
"learn to be contented, and we shall be on good terms again: though we","Pride and Prejudice"
"can never be what we once were to each other.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“That is the most unforgiving speech,” said Elizabeth, “that I ever","Pride and Prejudice"
"heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see you again","Pride and Prejudice"
"the dupe of Miss Bingley’s pretended regard.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he went to town last November he","Pride and Prejudice"
"really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of _my_ being indifferent","Pride and Prejudice"
"would have prevented his coming down again?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“He made a little mistake, to be sure; but it is to the credit of his","Pride and Prejudice"
"modesty.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"the little value he put on his own good qualities.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference","Pride and Prejudice"
"of his friend; for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving","Pride and Prejudice"
"heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice","Pride and Prejudice"
"her against him.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!” cried","Pride and Prejudice"
"Jane. “Oh, Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and blessed","Pride and Prejudice"
"above them all? If I could but see you as happy! If there were but such","Pride and Prejudice"
"another man for you!”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“If you were to give me forty such men I never could be so happy as you.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can have your","Pride and Prejudice"
"happiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and, perhaps, if I have very","Pride and Prejudice"
"good luck, I may meet with another Mr. Collins in time.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a","Pride and Prejudice"
"secret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Philips, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her","Pride and Prejudice"
"neighbours in Meryton.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the","Pride and Prejudice"

"CHAPTER LVI.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"[Illustration]","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"One morning, about a week after Bingley’s engagement with Jane had been","Pride and Prejudice"
"formed, as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the","Pride and Prejudice"
"dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the","Pride and Prejudice"
"sound of a carriage; and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the","Pride and Prejudice"
"lawn. It was too early in the morning for visitors; and besides, the","Pride and Prejudice"
"equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours. The horses","Pride and Prejudice"
"were post; and neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who","Pride and Prejudice"
"preceded it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that","Pride and Prejudice"
"somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet to avoid","Pride and Prejudice"
"the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with him into the","Pride and Prejudice"
"shrubbery. They both set off; and the conjectures of the remaining three","Pride and Prejudice"
"continued, though with little satisfaction, till the door was thrown","Pride and Prejudice"
"open, and their visitor entered. It was Lady Catherine de Bourgh.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"They were of course all intending to be surprised: but their","Pride and Prejudice"
"astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of Mrs.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bennet and Kitty, though she was perfectly unknown to them, even","Pride and Prejudice"
"inferior to what Elizabeth felt.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious, made no","Pride and Prejudice"
"other reply to Elizabeth’s salutation than a slight inclination of the","Pride and Prejudice"
"head, and sat down without saying a word. Elizabeth had mentioned her","Pride and Prejudice"
"name to her mother on her Ladyship’s entrance, though no request of","Pride and Prejudice"
"introduction had been made.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of such","Pride and Prejudice"
"high importance, received her with the utmost politeness. After sitting","Pride and Prejudice"
"for a moment in silence, she said, very stiffly, to Elizabeth,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your","Pride and Prejudice"
"mother?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth replied very concisely that she was.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“And _that_, I suppose, is one of your sisters?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yes, madam,” said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to a Lady Catherine.","Pride and Prejudice"
"“She is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all is lately married,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and my eldest is somewhere about the ground, walking with a young man,","Pride and Prejudice"
"who, I believe, will soon become a part of the family.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You have a very small park here,” returned Lady Catherine, after a","Pride and Prejudice"
"short silence.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my Lady, I dare say; but, I","Pride and Prejudice"
"assure you, it is much larger than Sir William Lucas’s.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“This must be a most inconvenient sitting-room for the evening in","Pride and Prejudice"
"summer: the windows are full west.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mrs. Bennet assured her that they never sat there after dinner; and then","Pride and Prejudice"
"added,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“May I take the liberty of asking your Ladyship whether you left Mr. and","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mrs. Collins well?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth now expected that she would produce a letter for her from","Pride and Prejudice"
"Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her calling. But no","Pride and Prejudice"
"letter appeared, and she was completely puzzled.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her Ladyship to take some","Pride and Prejudice"
"refreshment: but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not very politely,","Pride and Prejudice"
"declined eating anything; and then, rising up, said to Elizabeth,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little wilderness","Pride and Prejudice"
"on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a turn in it, if you","Pride and Prejudice"
"will favour me with your company.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Go, my dear,” cried her mother, “and show her Ladyship about the","Pride and Prejudice"
"different walks. I think she will be pleased with the hermitage.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth obeyed; and, running into her own room for her parasol,","Pride and Prejudice"
"attended her noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the hall,","Pride and Prejudice"
"Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and","Pride and Prejudice"
"drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be","Pride and Prejudice"
"decent-looking rooms, walked on.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Her carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her","Pride and Prejudice"
"waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the gravel walk","Pride and Prejudice"
"that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to make no effort for","Pride and Prejudice"
"conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and","Pride and Prejudice"
"disagreeable.","Pride and Prejudice"

"“How could I ever think her like her nephew?” said she, as she looked in","Pride and Prejudice"
"her face.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the following","Pride and Prejudice"
"manner:--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of my","Pride and Prejudice"
"journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell you why I","Pride and Prejudice"
"come.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Indeed, you are mistaken, madam; I have not been at all able to account","Pride and Prejudice"
"for the honour of seeing you here.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Miss Bennet,” replied her Ladyship, in an angry tone, “you ought to","Pride and Prejudice"
"know that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere _you_ may","Pride and Prejudice"
"choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character has ever been","Pride and Prejudice"
"celebrated for its sincerity and frankness; and in a cause of such","Pride and Prejudice"
"moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from it. A report of a most","Pride and Prejudice"
"alarming nature reached me two days ago. I was told, that not only your","Pride and Prejudice"
"sister was on the point of being most advantageously married, but that","Pride and Prejudice"
"_you_--that Miss Elizabeth Bennet would, in all likelihood, be soon","Pride and Prejudice"
"afterwards united to my nephew--my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I","Pride and Prejudice"
"_know_ it must be a scandalous falsehood, though I would not injure him","Pride and Prejudice"
"so much as to suppose the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on","Pride and Prejudice"
"setting off for this place, that I might make my sentiments known to","Pride and Prejudice"
"you.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“If you believed it impossible to be true,” said Elizabeth, colouring","Pride and Prejudice"
"with astonishment and disdain, “I wonder you took the trouble of coming","Pride and Prejudice"
"so far. What could your Ladyship propose by it?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“At once to insist upon having such a report universally contradicted.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,” said Elizabeth","Pride and Prejudice"
"coolly, “will be rather a confirmation of it--if, indeed, such a report","Pride and Prejudice"
"is in existence.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“If! do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been","Pride and Prejudice"
"industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such a","Pride and Prejudice"
"report is spread abroad?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I never heard that it was.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“And can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for it?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your Ladyship. _You_","Pride and Prejudice"
"may ask questions which _I_ shall not choose to answer.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being satisfied. Has","Pride and Prejudice"
"he, has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Your Ladyship has declared it to be impossible.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“It ought to be so; it must be so, while he retains the use of his","Pride and Prejudice"
"reason. But _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of infatuation,","Pride and Prejudice"
"have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family. You","Pride and Prejudice"
"may have drawn him in.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to such","Pride and Prejudice"
"language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he has in the world,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and am entitled to know all his dearest concerns.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“But you are not entitled to know _mine_; nor will such behaviour as","Pride and Prejudice"
"this ever induce me to be explicit.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the","Pride and Prejudice"
"presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy is","Pride and Prejudice"
"engaged to _my daughter_. Now, what have you to say?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Only this,--that if he is so, you can have no reason to suppose he will","Pride and Prejudice"
"make an offer to me.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their infancy,","Pride and Prejudice"
"they have been intended for each other. It was the favourite wish of","Pride and Prejudice"
"_his_ mother, as well as of hers. While in their cradles we planned the","Pride and Prejudice"
"union; and now, at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be","Pride and Prejudice"
"accomplished, is their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of","Pride and Prejudice"
"inferior birth, of no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to","Pride and Prejudice"
"the family? Do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends--to his","Pride and Prejudice"
"tacit engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of","Pride and Prejudice"
"propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say, that from his","Pride and Prejudice"
"earliest hours he was destined for his cousin?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yes; and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there is no","Pride and Prejudice"
"other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall certainly not be","Pride and Prejudice"
"kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry","Pride and Prejudice"
"Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you could in planning the","Pride and Prejudice"
"marriage. Its completion depended on others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by","Pride and Prejudice"
"honour nor inclination confined to his cousin, why is not he to make","Pride and Prejudice"
"another choice? And if I am that choice, why may not I accept him?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Because honour, decorum, prudence--nay, interest--forbid it. Yes, Miss","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by his family or","Pride and Prejudice"
"friends, if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all. You will","Pride and Prejudice"
"be censured, slighted, and despised, by everyone connected with him.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Your alliance will be a disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned","Pride and Prejudice"
"by any of us.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“These are heavy misfortunes,” replied Elizabeth. “But the wife of Mr.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily","Pride and Prejudice"
"attached to her situation, that she could, upon the whole, have no cause","Pride and Prejudice"
"to repine.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your gratitude","Pride and Prejudice"
"for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to me on that","Pride and Prejudice"
"score? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss Bennet, that I came","Pride and Prejudice"
"here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose; nor will I","Pride and Prejudice"
"be dissuaded from it. I have not been used to submit to any person’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"whims. I have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“_That_ will make your Ladyship’s situation at present more pitiable;","Pride and Prejudice"
"but it will have no effect on _me_.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I will not be interrupted! Hear me in silence. My daughter and my","Pride and Prejudice"
"nephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the maternal","Pride and Prejudice"
"side, from the same noble line; and, on the father’s, from respectable,","Pride and Prejudice"
"honourable, and ancient, though untitled, families. Their fortune on","Pride and Prejudice"
"both sides is splendid. They are destined for each other by the voice of","Pride and Prejudice"
"every member of their respective houses; and what is to divide","Pride and Prejudice"
"them?--the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family,","Pride and Prejudice"
"connections, or fortune! Is this to be endured? But it must not, shall","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“And I certainly _never_ shall give it. I am not to be intimidated into","Pride and Prejudice"

"your daughter; but would my giving you the wished-for promise make","Pride and Prejudice"
"_their_ marriage at all more probable? Supposing him to be attached to","Pride and Prejudice"

"frivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have widely mistaken my","Pride and Prejudice"

"How far your nephew might approve of your interference in _his_ affairs,","Pride and Prejudice"

"stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister’s infamous","Pride and Prejudice"
"elopement. I know it all; that the young man’s marrying her was a","Pride and Prejudice"

"_such_ a girl to be my nephew’s sister? Is _her_ husband, who is the son","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey the","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,” replied Elizabeth, “has any","Pride and Prejudice"

"would be violated by my marriage with Mr. Darcy. And with regard to the","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth into could not be easily overcome; nor could she for many","Pride and Prejudice"
"hours learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady Catherine, it","Pride and Prejudice"
"appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this journey from Rosings","Pride and Prejudice"
"for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with Mr.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to be sure! but from what the report of","Pride and Prejudice"
"their engagement could originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine;","Pride and Prejudice"
"till she recollected that _his_ being the intimate friend of Bingley,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and _her_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the","Pride and Prejudice"
"expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to supply","Pride and Prejudice"
"the idea. She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her","Pride and Prejudice"
"sister must bring them more frequently together. And her neighbours at","Pride and Prejudice"
"Lucas Lodge, therefore, (for through their communication with the","Pride and Prejudice"
"Collinses, the report, she concluded, had reached Lady Catherine,) had","Pride and Prejudice"
"only set _that_ down as almost certain and immediate which _she_ had","Pride and Prejudice"
"looked forward to as possible at some future time.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"In revolving Lady Catherine’s expressions, however, she could not help","Pride and Prejudice"
"feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting","Pride and Prejudice"
"in this interference. From what she had said of her resolution to","Pride and Prejudice"
"prevent the marriage, it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an","Pride and Prejudice"
"application to her nephew; and how he might take a similar","Pride and Prejudice"
"representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared","Pride and Prejudice"
"not pronounce. She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his","Pride and Prejudice"
"aunt, or his dependence on her judgment, but it was natural to suppose","Pride and Prejudice"
"that he thought much higher of her Ladyship than _she_ could do; and it","Pride and Prejudice"
"was certain, that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _one_","Pride and Prejudice"
"whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own, his aunt would","Pride and Prejudice"
"address him on his weakest side. With his notions of dignity, he would","Pride and Prejudice"
"probably feel that the arguments, which to Elizabeth had appeared weak","Pride and Prejudice"
"and ridiculous, contained much good sense and solid reasoning.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"If he had been wavering before, as to what he should do, which had often","Pride and Prejudice"
"seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might","Pride and Prejudice"
"settle every doubt, and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity","Pride and Prejudice"
"unblemished could make him. In that case he would return no more. Lady","Pride and Prejudice"
"Catherine might see him in her way through town; and his engagement to","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bingley of coming again to Netherfield must give way.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his","Pride and Prejudice"
"friend within a few days,” she added, “I shall know how to understand","Pride and Prejudice"
"it. I shall then give over every expectation, every wish of his","Pride and Prejudice"
"constancy. If he is satisfied with only regretting me, when he might","Pride and Prejudice"
"have obtained my affections and hand, I shall soon cease to regret him","Pride and Prejudice"
"at all.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their visitor had","Pride and Prejudice"
"been, was very great: but they obligingly satisfied it with the same","Pride and Prejudice"
"kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs. Bennet’s curiosity; and","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The next morning, as she was going down stairs, she was met by her","Pride and Prejudice"
"father, who came out of his library with a letter in his hand.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Lizzy,” said he, “I was going to look for you: come into my room.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She followed him thither; and her curiosity to know what he had to tell","Pride and Prejudice"
"her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner","Pride and Prejudice"
"connected with the letter he held. It suddenly struck her that it might","Pride and Prejudice"
"be from Lady Catherine, and she anticipated with dismay all the","Pride and Prejudice"
"consequent explanations.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She followed her father to the fireplace, and they both sat down. He","Pride and Prejudice"
"then said,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me","Pride and Prejudice"
"exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to know its","Pride and Prejudice"
"contents. I did not know before that I had _two_ daughters on the brink","Pride and Prejudice"
"of matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a very important conquest.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The colour now rushed into Elizabeth’s cheeks in the instantaneous","Pride and Prejudice"
"conviction of its being a letter from the nephew, instead of the aunt;","Pride and Prejudice"
"and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained","Pride and Prejudice"
"himself at all, or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to","Pride and Prejudice"
"herself, when her father continued,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such matters","Pride and Prejudice"
"as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity to discover the","Pride and Prejudice"
"name of your admirer. This letter is from Mr. Collins.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“From Mr. Collins! and what can _he_ have to say?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Something very much to the purpose, of course. He begins with","Pride and Prejudice"
"congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter, of","Pride and Prejudice"
"which, it seems, he has been told by some of the good-natured, gossiping","Pride and Prejudice"
"Lucases. I shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says","Pride and Prejudice"
"on that point. What relates to yourself is as follows:--‘Having thus","Pride and Prejudice"
"offered you the sincere congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on","Pride and Prejudice"
"this happy event, let me now add a short hint on the subject of another,","Pride and Prejudice"
"of which we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet, after","Pride and Prejudice"
"her eldest sister has resigned it; and the chosen partner of her fate","Pride and Prejudice"
"may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages","Pride and Prejudice"
"in this land.’ Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this?","Pride and Prejudice"
"‘This young gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with everything the","Pride and Prejudice"
"heart of mortal can most desire,--splendid property, noble kindred, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"extensive patronage. Yet, in spite of all these temptations, let me warn","Pride and Prejudice"
"my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of what evils you may incur by a","Pride and Prejudice"
"precipitate closure with this gentleman’s proposals, which, of course,","Pride and Prejudice"
"you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of.’ Have you any idea,","Pride and Prejudice"
"Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it comes out. ‘My motive for","Pride and Prejudice"
"cautioning you is as follows:--We have reason to imagine that his aunt,","Pride and Prejudice"
"Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on the match with a friendly","Pride and Prejudice"
"eye.’ _Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_","Pride and Prejudice"
"surprised you. Could he, or the Lucases, have pitched on any man, within","Pride and Prejudice"
"the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have given the lie more","Pride and Prejudice"
"effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy, who never looks at any","Pride and Prejudice"
"woman but to see a blemish, and who probably never looked at _you_ in","Pride and Prejudice"
"his life! It is admirable!”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth tried to join in her father’s pleasantry, but could only force","Pride and Prejudice"
"one most reluctant smile. Never had his wit been directed in a manner so","Pride and Prejudice"
"little agreeable to her.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Are you not diverted?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Oh, yes. Pray read on.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“‘After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her Ladyship last","Pride and Prejudice"
"night, she immediately, with her usual condescension, expressed what she","Pride and Prejudice"
"felt on the occasion; when it became apparent, that, on the score of","Pride and Prejudice"
"some family objections on the part of my cousin, she would never give","Pride and Prejudice"
"her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my","Pride and Prejudice"
"duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she","Pride and Prejudice"
"and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run","Pride and Prejudice"
"hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.’ Mr.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Collins, moreover, adds, ‘I am truly rejoiced that my cousin Lydia’s sad","Pride and Prejudice"
"business has been so well hushed up, and am only concerned that their","Pride and Prejudice"
"living together before the marriage took place should be so generally","Pride and Prejudice"
"known. I must not, however, neglect the duties of my station, or refrain","Pride and Prejudice"
"from declaring my amazement, at hearing that you received the young","Pride and Prejudice"
"couple into your house as soon as they were married. It was an","Pride and Prejudice"
"encouragement of vice; and had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should","Pride and Prejudice"
"very strenuously have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them as","Pride and Prejudice"
"a Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their","Pride and Prejudice"
"names to be mentioned in your hearing.’ _That_ is his notion of","Pride and Prejudice"
"Christian forgiveness! The rest of his letter is only about his dear","Pride and Prejudice"
"Charlotte’s situation, and his expectation of a young olive-branch. But,","Pride and Prejudice"
"Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it. You are not going to be","Pride and Prejudice"
"_missish_, I hope, and pretend to be affronted at an idle report. For","Pride and Prejudice"
"what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them","Pride and Prejudice"
"in our turn?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Oh,” cried Elizabeth, “I am exceedingly diverted. But it is so","Pride and Prejudice"
"strange!”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yes, _that_ is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other man","Pride and Prejudice"
"it would have been nothing; but _his_ perfect indifference and _your_","Pride and Prejudice"
"pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd! Much as I abominate","Pride and Prejudice"
"writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins’s correspondence for any","Pride and Prejudice"
"consideration. Nay, when I read a letter of his, I cannot help giving","Pride and Prejudice"
"him the preference even over Wickham, much as I value the impudence and","Pride and Prejudice"
"hypocrisy of my son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine","Pride and Prejudice"
"about this report? Did she call to refuse her consent?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"To this question his daughter replied only with a laugh; and as it had","Pride and Prejudice"
"been asked without the least suspicion, she was not distressed by his","Pride and Prejudice"
"repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her","Pride and Prejudice"
"feelings appear what they were not. It was necessary to laugh when she","Pride and Prejudice"
"would rather have cried. Her father had most cruelly mortified her by","Pride and Prejudice"
"what he said of Mr. Darcy’s indifference; and she could do nothing but","Pride and Prejudice"

"Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend, as","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he was able to bring Darcy","Pride and Prejudice"
"with him to Longbourn before many days had passed after Lady Catherine’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"visit. The gentlemen arrived early; and, before Mrs. Bennet had time to","Pride and Prejudice"
"tell him of their having seen his aunt, of which her daughter sat in","Pride and Prejudice"
"momentary dread, Bingley, who wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed","Pride and Prejudice"
"their all walking out. It was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the","Pride and Prejudice"
"habit of walking, Mary could never spare time, but the remaining five","Pride and Prejudice"
"set off together. Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to","Pride and Prejudice"
"outstrip them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy","Pride and Prejudice"
"were to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty was","Pride and Prejudice"
"too much afraid of him to talk; Elizabeth was secretly forming a","Pride and Prejudice"
"desperate resolution; and, perhaps, he might be doing the same.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"They walked towards the Lucases’, because Kitty wished to call upon","Pride and Prejudice"
"Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern,","Pride and Prejudice"
"when Kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone. Now was the","Pride and Prejudice"
"moment for her resolution to be executed; and while her courage was","Pride and Prejudice"
"high, she immediately said,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature, and for the sake of giving","Pride and Prejudice"
"relief to my own feelings care not how much I may be wounding yours. I","Pride and Prejudice"
"can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor","Pride and Prejudice"
"sister. Ever since I have known it I have been most anxious to","Pride and Prejudice"
"acknowledge to you how gratefully I feel it. Were it known to the rest","Pride and Prejudice"
"of my family I should not have merely my own gratitude to express.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,” replied Darcy, in a tone of surprise","Pride and Prejudice"
"and emotion, “that you have ever been informed of what may, in a","Pride and Prejudice"
"mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not think Mrs. Gardiner","Pride and Prejudice"
"was so little to be trusted.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You must not blame my aunt. Lydia’s thoughtlessness first betrayed to","Pride and Prejudice"
"me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of course, I could","Pride and Prejudice"
"not rest till I knew the particulars. Let me thank you again and again,","Pride and Prejudice"
"in the name of all my family, for that generous compassion which induced","Pride and Prejudice"
"you to take so much trouble, and bear so many mortifications, for the","Pride and Prejudice"
"sake of discovering them.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“If you _will_ thank me,” he replied, “let it be for yourself alone.","Pride and Prejudice"
"That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other","Pride and Prejudice"
"inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to deny. But your","Pride and Prejudice"
"_family_ owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I believe I thought","Pride and Prejudice"
"only of _you_.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short pause,","Pride and Prejudice"
"her companion added, “You are too generous to trifle with me. If your","Pride and Prejudice"
"feelings are still what they were last April, tell me so at once. _My_","Pride and Prejudice"
"affections and wishes are unchanged; but one word from you will silence","Pride and Prejudice"
"me on this subject for ever.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of","Pride and Prejudice"
"his situation, now forced herself to speak; and immediately, though not","Pride and Prejudice"
"very fluently, gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone","Pride and Prejudice"
"so material a change since the period to which he alluded, as to make","Pride and Prejudice"
"her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances. The","Pride and Prejudice"
"happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never","Pride and Prejudice"
"felt before; and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as","Pride and Prejudice"
"warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had Elizabeth","Pride and Prejudice"
"been able to encounter his eyes, she might have seen how well the","Pride and Prejudice"
"expression of heartfelt delight diffused over his face became him: but","Pride and Prejudice"
"though she could not look she could listen; and he told her of feelings","Pride and Prejudice"
"which, in proving of what importance she was to him, made his affection","Pride and Prejudice"
"every moment more valuable.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"They walked on without knowing in what direction. There was too much to","Pride and Prejudice"
"be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any other objects. She","Pride and Prejudice"
"soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding","Pride and Prejudice"
"to the efforts of his aunt, who _did_ call on him in her return through","Pride and Prejudice"
"London, and there relate her journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the","Pride and Prejudice"
"substance of her conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on","Pride and Prejudice"
"every expression of the latter, which, in her Ladyship’s apprehension,","Pride and Prejudice"
"peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance, in the belief that","Pride and Prejudice"
"such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from","Pride and Prejudice"
"her nephew which _she_ had refused to give. But, unluckily for her","Pride and Prejudice"
"Ladyship, its effect had been exactly contrariwise.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“It taught me to hope,” said he, “as I had scarcely ever allowed myself","Pride and Prejudice"
"to hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be certain, that","Pride and Prejudice"
"had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided against me, you would have","Pride and Prejudice"
"acknowledged it to Lady Catherine frankly and openly.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied, “Yes, you know enough of","Pride and Prejudice"
"my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_. After abusing you so","Pride and Prejudice"
"abominably to your face, I could have no scruple in abusing you to all","Pride and Prejudice"
"your relations.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“What did you say of me that I did not deserve? For though your","Pride and Prejudice"
"accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my behaviour","Pride and Prejudice"
"to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It was","Pride and Prejudice"
"unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that","Pride and Prejudice"
"evening,” said Elizabeth. “The conduct of neither, if strictly","Pride and Prejudice"
"examined, will be irreproachable; but since then we have both, I hope,","Pride and Prejudice"
"improved in civility.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of what I","Pride and Prejudice"
"then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions during the whole of","Pride and Prejudice"
"it, is now, and has been many months, inexpressibly painful to me. Your","Pride and Prejudice"
"reproof, so well applied, I shall never forget: ‘Had you behaved in a","Pride and Prejudice"
"more gentlemanlike manner.’ Those were your words. You know not, you can","Pride and Prejudice"
"scarcely conceive, how they have tortured me; though it was some time, I","Pride and Prejudice"
"confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong an","Pride and Prejudice"
"impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever felt in such","Pride and Prejudice"
"a way.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every proper","Pride and Prejudice"
"feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I shall never","Pride and Prejudice"
"forget, as you said that I could not have addressed you in any possible","Pride and Prejudice"
"way that would induce you to accept me.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Oh, do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not do at","Pride and Prejudice"
"all. I assure you that I have long been most heartily ashamed of it.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Darcy mentioned his letter. “Did it,” said he,--“did it _soon_ make you","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so. The","Pride and Prejudice"
"adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The feelings","Pride and Prejudice"
"of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely","Pride and Prejudice"
"different from what they were then, that every unpleasant circumstance","Pride and Prejudice"

"retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the contentment","Pride and Prejudice"
"arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is much better, of","Pride and Prejudice"
"ignorance. But with _me_, it is not so. Painful recollections will","Pride and Prejudice"
"intrude, which cannot, which ought not to be repelled. I have been a","Pride and Prejudice"
"selfish being all my life, in practice, though not in principle. As a","Pride and Prejudice"
"child I was taught what was _right_, but I was not taught to correct my","Pride and Prejudice"
"temper. I was given good principles, but left to follow them in pride","Pride and Prejudice"
"and conceit. Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only _child_),","Pride and Prejudice"
"I was spoiled by my parents, who, though good themselves, (my father","Pride and Prejudice"
"particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable,) allowed, encouraged,","Pride and Prejudice"
"almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing, to care for none beyond","Pride and Prejudice"
"my own family circle, to think meanly of all the rest of the world, to","Pride and Prejudice"
"_wish_ at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with","Pride and Prejudice"
"my own. Such I was, from eight to eight-and-twenty; and such I might","Pride and Prejudice"
"still have been but for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not","Pride and Prejudice"
"owe you! You taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most","Pride and Prejudice"
"advantageous. By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a","Pride and Prejudice"
"doubt of my reception. You showed me how insufficient were all my","Pride and Prejudice"
"pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you to be","Pride and Prejudice"
"wishing, expecting my addresses.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I assure","Pride and Prejudice"
"you. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might often lead me","Pride and Prejudice"
"wrong. How you must have hated me after _that_ evening!”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Hate you! I was angry, perhaps, at first, but my anger soon began to","Pride and Prejudice"
"take a proper direction.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me when we met at","Pride and Prejudice"
"Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“No, indeed, I felt nothing but surprise.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed by you.","Pride and Prejudice"
"My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary politeness, and I","Pride and Prejudice"
"confess that I did not expect to receive _more_ than my due.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“My object _then_,” replied Darcy, “was to show you, by every civility","Pride and Prejudice"
"in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the past; and I hoped","Pride and Prejudice"
"to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill opinion, by letting you","Pride and Prejudice"
"see that your reproofs had been attended to. How soon any other wishes","Pride and Prejudice"
"introduced themselves, I can hardly tell, but I believe in about half","Pride and Prejudice"

"He then told her of Georgiana’s delight in her acquaintance, and of her","Pride and Prejudice"
"disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally leading to","Pride and Prejudice"
"the cause of that interruption, she soon learnt that his resolution of","Pride and Prejudice"
"following her from Derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed","Pride and Prejudice"
"before he quitted the inn, and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there","Pride and Prejudice"
"had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must","Pride and Prejudice"
"comprehend.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"She expressed her gratitude again, but it was too painful a subject to","Pride and Prejudice"
"each to be dwelt on farther.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy to know","Pride and Prejudice"
"anything about it, they found at last, on examining their watches, that","Pride and Prejudice"
"it was time to be at home.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“What could have become of Mr. Bingley and Jane?” was a wonder which","Pride and Prejudice"
"introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs. Darcy was delighted with","Pride and Prejudice"
"their engagement; his friend had given him the earliest information of","Pride and Prejudice"
"it.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I must ask whether you were surprised?” said Elizabeth.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as much.” And","Pride and Prejudice"
"though he exclaimed at the term, she found that it had been pretty much","Pride and Prejudice"
"the case.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“On the evening before my going to London,” said he, “I made a","Pride and Prejudice"
"confession to him, which I believe I ought to have made long ago. I told","Pride and Prejudice"
"him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his","Pride and Prejudice"
"affairs absurd and impertinent. His surprise was great. He had never had","Pride and Prejudice"
"the slightest suspicion. I told him, moreover, that I believed myself","Pride and Prejudice"
"mistaken in supposing, as I had done, that your sister was indifferent","Pride and Prejudice"
"to him; and as I could easily perceive that his attachment to her was","Pride and Prejudice"
"unabated, I felt no doubt of their happiness together.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth could not help smiling at his easy manner of directing his","Pride and Prejudice"
"friend.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Did you speak from your own observation,” said she, “when you told him","Pride and Prejudice"
"that my sister loved him, or merely from my information last spring?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“From the former. I had narrowly observed her, during the two visits","Pride and Prejudice"
"which I had lately made her here; and I was convinced of her affection.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate conviction to","Pride and Prejudice"
"him.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His diffidence had","Pride and Prejudice"
"prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case, but","Pride and Prejudice"
"his reliance on mine made everything easy. I was obliged to confess one","Pride and Prejudice"
"thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended him. I could not","Pride and Prejudice"
"allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months","Pride and Prejudice"
"last winter, that I had known it, and purposely kept it from him. He was","Pride and Prejudice"
"angry. But his anger, I am persuaded, lasted no longer than he remained","Pride and Prejudice"
"in any doubt of your sister’s sentiments. He has heartily forgiven me","Pride and Prejudice"
"now.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most delightful","Pride and Prejudice"
"friend; so easily guided that his worth was invaluable; but she checked","Pride and Prejudice"
"herself. She remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"it was rather too early to begin. In anticipating the happiness of","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bingley, which of course was to be inferior only to his own, he","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?” was a question","Pride and Prejudice"
"which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered the room, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"from all the others when they sat down to table. She had only to say in","Pride and Prejudice"
"reply, that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own","Pride and Prejudice"
"knowledge. She coloured as she spoke; but neither that, nor anything","Pride and Prejudice"
"else, awakened a suspicion of the truth.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary. The","Pride and Prejudice"
"acknowledged lovers talked and laughed; the unacknowledged were silent.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth;","Pride and Prejudice"
"and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather _knew_ that she was happy","Pride and Prejudice"
"than _felt_ herself to be so; for, besides the immediate embarrassment,","Pride and Prejudice"
"there were other evils before her. She anticipated what would be felt in","Pride and Prejudice"
"the family when her situation became known: she was aware that no one","Pride and Prejudice"
"liked him but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a","Pride and Prejudice"
"_dislike_ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"At night she opened her heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very far","Pride and Prejudice"
"from Miss Bennet’s general habits, she was absolutely incredulous here.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be! Engaged to Mr. Darcy! No, no,","Pride and Prejudice"
"you shall not deceive me: I know it to be impossible.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“This is a wretched beginning, indeed! My sole dependence was on you;","Pride and Prejudice"
"and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not. Yet, indeed, I","Pride and Prejudice"
"am in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He still loves me, and we","Pride and Prejudice"
"are engaged.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Jane looked at her doubtingly. “Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know how much","Pride and Prejudice"
"you dislike him.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot. Perhaps I","Pride and Prejudice"
"did not always love him so well as I do now; but in such cases as these","Pride and Prejudice"
"a good memory is unpardonable. This is the last time I shall ever","Pride and Prejudice"
"remember it myself.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more","Pride and Prejudice"
"seriously, assured her of its truth.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Good heaven! can it be really so? Yet now I must believe you,” cried","Pride and Prejudice"
"Jane. “My dear, dear Lizzy, I would, I do congratulate you; but are you","Pride and Prejudice"
"certain--forgive the question--are you quite certain that you can be","Pride and Prejudice"
"happy with him?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already that we","Pride and Prejudice"
"are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you pleased, Jane?","Pride and Prejudice"
"Shall you like to have such a brother?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself more","Pride and Prejudice"
"delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as impossible. And do you","Pride and Prejudice"
"really love him quite well enough? Oh, Lizzy! do anything rather than","Pride and Prejudice"
"marry without affection. Are you quite sure that you feel what you ought","Pride and Prejudice"
"to do?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do when I","Pride and Prejudice"
"tell you all.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“What do you mean?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Why, I must confess that I love him better than I do Bingley. I am","Pride and Prejudice"
"afraid you will be angry.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“My dearest sister, now be, _be_ serious. I want to talk very seriously.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Let me know everything that I am to know without delay. Will you tell me","Pride and Prejudice"
"how long you have loved him?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began;","Pride and Prejudice"
"but I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds","Pride and Prejudice"
"at Pemberley.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Another entreaty that she would be serious, however, produced the","Pride and Prejudice"
"desired effect; and she soon satisfied Jane by her solemn assurances of","Pride and Prejudice"
"attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss Bennet had nothing","Pride and Prejudice"
"further to wish.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Now I am quite happy,” said she, “for you will be as happy as myself. I","Pride and Prejudice"
"always had a value for him. Were it for nothing but his love of you, I","Pride and Prejudice"
"must always have esteemed him; but now, as Bingley’s friend and your","Pride and Prejudice"
"husband, there can be only Bingley and yourself more dear to me. But,","Pride and Prejudice"
"Lizzy, you have been very sly, very reserved with me. How little did you","Pride and Prejudice"
"tell me of what passed at Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know","Pride and Prejudice"
"of it to another, not to you.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy. She had been unwilling to","Pride and Prejudice"
"mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made","Pride and Prejudice"
"her equally avoid the name of his friend: but now she would no longer","Pride and Prejudice"
"conceal from her his share in Lydia’s marriage. All was acknowledged,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and half the night spent in conversation.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Good gracious!” cried Mrs. Bennet, as she stood at a window the next","Pride and Prejudice"
"morning, “if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here again with","Pride and Prejudice"
"our dear Bingley! What can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always","Pride and Prejudice"
"coming here? I had no notion but he would go a-shooting, or something or","Pride and Prejudice"
"other, and not disturb us with his company. What shall we do with him?","Pride and Prejudice"
"Lizzy, you must walk out with him again, that he may not be in Bingley’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"way.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal; yet","Pride and Prejudice"
"was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an","Pride and Prejudice"
"epithet.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her so expressively, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his good information;","Pride and Prejudice"
"and he soon afterwards said aloud, “Mrs. Bennet, have you no more lanes","Pride and Prejudice"
"hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to-day?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,” said Mrs. Bennet, “to walk","Pride and Prejudice"
"to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and Mr. Darcy has","Pride and Prejudice"
"never seen the view.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“It may do very well for the others,” replied Mr. Bingley; “but I am","Pride and Prejudice"
"sure it will be too much for Kitty. Won’t it, Kitty?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Kitty owned that she had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great","Pride and Prejudice"
"curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently","Pride and Prejudice"
"consented. As she went upstairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet followed her,","Pride and Prejudice"
"saying,--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that","Pride and Prejudice"
"disagreeable man all to yourself; but I hope you will not mind it. It is","Pride and Prejudice"
"all for Jane’s sake, you know; and there is no occasion for talking to","Pride and Prejudice"
"him except just now and then; so do not put yourself to inconvenience.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet’s consent should be","Pride and Prejudice"
"asked in the course of the evening: Elizabeth reserved to herself the","Pride and Prejudice"
"application for her mother’s. She could not determine how her mother","Pride and Prejudice"
"would take it; sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur","Pride and Prejudice"
"would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man; but whether she","Pride and Prejudice"
"were violently set against the match, or violently delighted with it, it","Pride and Prejudice"
"was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to","Pride and Prejudice"
"her sense; and she could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the","Pride and Prejudice"
"first raptures of her joy, than the first vehemence of her","Pride and Prejudice"
"disapprobation.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library, she saw","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him, and her agitation on seeing it was","Pride and Prejudice"
"extreme. She did not fear her father’s opposition, but he was going to","Pride and Prejudice"
"be made unhappy, and that it should be through her means; that _she_,","Pride and Prejudice"
"his favourite child, should be distressing him by her choice, should be","Pride and Prejudice"
"filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her, was a wretched","Pride and Prejudice"
"reflection, and she sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when,","Pride and Prejudice"
"looking at him, she was a little relieved by his smile. In a few minutes","Pride and Prejudice"
"he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty; and, while","Pride and Prejudice"
"pretending to admire her work, said in a whisper, “Go to your father; he","Pride and Prejudice"
"wants you in the library.” She was gone directly.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Her father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Lizzy,” said he, “what are you doing? Are you out of your senses to be","Pride and Prejudice"
"accepting this man? Have not you always hated him?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"How earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more","Pride and Prejudice"
"reasonable, her expressions more moderate! It would have spared her from","Pride and Prejudice"
"explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give;","Pride and Prejudice"
"but they were now necessary, and she assured him, with some confusion,","Pride and Prejudice"
"of her attachment to Mr. Darcy.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Or, in other words, you are determined to have him. He is rich, to be","Pride and Prejudice"
"sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages than Jane.","Pride and Prejudice"
"But will they make you happy?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Have you any other objection,” said Elizabeth, “than your belief of my","Pride and Prejudice"
"indifference?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of man; but","Pride and Prejudice"
"this would be nothing if you really liked him.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I do, I do like him,” she replied, with tears in her eyes; “I love him.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Indeed he has no improper pride. He is perfectly amiable. You do not","Pride and Prejudice"
"know what he really is; then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in","Pride and Prejudice"
"such terms.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Lizzy,” said her father, “I have given him my consent. He is the kind","Pride and Prejudice"
"of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything, which he","Pride and Prejudice"
"condescended to ask. I now give it to _you_, if you are resolved on","Pride and Prejudice"
"having him. But let me advise you to think better of it. I know your","Pride and Prejudice"
"disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be neither happy nor","Pride and Prejudice"
"respectable, unless you truly esteemed your husband, unless you looked","Pride and Prejudice"
"up to him as a superior. Your lively talents would place you in the","Pride and Prejudice"
"greatest danger in an unequal marriage. You could scarcely escape","Pride and Prejudice"
"discredit and misery. My child, let me not have the grief of seeing","Pride and Prejudice"
"_you_ unable to respect your partner in life. You know not what you are","Pride and Prejudice"
"about.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her reply;","Pride and Prejudice"
"and, at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was really the","Pride and Prejudice"
"object of her choice, by explaining the gradual change which her","Pride and Prejudice"
"estimation of him had undergone, relating her absolute certainty that","Pride and Prejudice"
"his affection was not the work of a day, but had stood the test of many","Pride and Prejudice"
"months’ suspense, and enumerating with energy all his good qualities,","Pride and Prejudice"
"she did conquer her father’s incredulity, and reconcile him to the","Pride and Prejudice"
"match.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Well, my dear,” said he, when she ceased speaking, “I have no more to","Pride and Prejudice"
"say. If this be the case, he deserves you. I could not have parted with","Pride and Prejudice"
"you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"To complete the favourable impression, she then told him what Mr. Darcy","Pride and Prejudice"
"had voluntarily done for Lydia. He heard her with astonishment.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did everything;","Pride and Prejudice"
"made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow’s debts, and got him","Pride and Prejudice"
"his commission! So much the better. It will save me a world of trouble","Pride and Prejudice"
"and economy. Had it been your uncle’s doing, I must and _would_ have","Pride and Prejudice"
"paid him; but these violent young lovers carry everything their own","Pride and Prejudice"
"way. I shall offer to pay him to-morrow, he will rant and storm about","Pride and Prejudice"
"his love for you, and there will be an end of the matter.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"He then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Collins’s letter; and after laughing at her some time, allowed her","Pride and Prejudice"
"at last to go, saying, as she quitted the room, “If any young men come","Pride and Prejudice"
"for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at leisure.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth’s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and, after","Pride and Prejudice"
"half an hour’s quiet reflection in her own room, she was able to join","Pride and Prejudice"
"the others with tolerable composure. Everything was too recent for","Pride and Prejudice"
"gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away; there was no longer","Pride and Prejudice"
"anything material to be dreaded, and the comfort of ease and familiarity","Pride and Prejudice"
"would come in time.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"When her mother went up to her dressing-room at night, she followed her,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and made the important communication. Its effect was most extraordinary;","Pride and Prejudice"
"for, on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat quite still, and unable to","Pride and Prejudice"
"utter a syllable. Nor was it under many, many minutes, that she could","Pride and Prejudice"
"comprehend what she heard, though not in general backward to credit what","Pride and Prejudice"
"was for the advantage of her family, or that came in the shape of a","Pride and Prejudice"
"lover to any of them. She began at length to recover, to fidget about in","Pride and Prejudice"
"her chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy! Who would","Pride and Prejudice"
"have thought it? And is it really true? Oh, my sweetest Lizzy! how rich","Pride and Prejudice"
"and how great you will be! What pin-money, what jewels, what carriages","Pride and Prejudice"
"you will have! Jane’s is nothing to it--nothing at all. I am so","Pride and Prejudice"
"pleased--so happy. Such a charming man! so handsome! so tall! Oh, my","Pride and Prejudice"
"dear Lizzy! pray apologize for my having disliked him so much before. I","Pride and Prejudice"
"hope he will overlook it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Everything","Pride and Prejudice"
"that is charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh,","Pride and Prejudice"
"Lord! what will become of me? I shall go distracted.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted; and","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself,","Pride and Prejudice"
"soon went away. But before she had been three minutes in her own room,","Pride and Prejudice"
"her mother followed her.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“My dearest child,” she cried, “I can think of nothing else. Ten","Pride and Prejudice"
"thousand a year, and very likely more! ‘Tis as good as a lord! And a","Pride and Prejudice"
"special licence--you must and shall be married by a special licence.","Pride and Prejudice"
"But, my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is particularly fond","Pride and Prejudice"
"of, that I may have it to-morrow.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"This was a sad omen of what her mother’s behaviour to the gentleman","Pride and Prejudice"
"himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in the certain","Pride and Prejudice"
"possession of his warmest affection, and secure of her relations’","Pride and Prejudice"
"consent, there was still something to be wished for. But the morrow","Pride and Prejudice"
"passed off much better than she expected; for Mrs. Bennet luckily stood","Pride and Prejudice"
"in such awe of her intended son-in-law, that she ventured not to speak","Pride and Prejudice"
"to him, unless it was in her power to offer him any attention, or mark","Pride and Prejudice"
"her deference for his opinion.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get","Pride and Prejudice"
"acquainted with him; and Mr. Bennet soon assured her that he was rising","Pride and Prejudice"
"every hour in his esteem.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,” said he. “Wickham, perhaps,","Pride and Prejudice"

"Elizabeth’s spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she wanted Mr.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her. “How could","Pride and Prejudice"
"you begin?” said she. “I can comprehend your going on charmingly, when","Pride and Prejudice"
"you had once made a beginning; but what could set you off in the first","Pride and Prejudice"
"place?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the words, which","Pride and Prejudice"
"laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in the middle before I","Pride and Prejudice"
"knew that I _had_ begun.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners--my behaviour","Pride and Prejudice"
"to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil, and I never spoke","Pride and Prejudice"
"to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not. Now, be","Pride and Prejudice"
"sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“For the liveliness of your mind I did.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little less.","Pride and Prejudice"
"The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference, of officious","Pride and Prejudice"
"attention. You were disgusted with the women who were always speaking,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and looking, and thinking for _your_ approbation alone. I roused and","Pride and Prejudice"
"interested you, because I was so unlike _them_. Had you not been really","Pride and Prejudice"
"amiable you would have hated me for it: but in spite of the pains you","Pride and Prejudice"
"took to disguise yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and","Pride and Prejudice"
"in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously","Pride and Prejudice"
"courted you. There--I have saved you the trouble of accounting for it;","Pride and Prejudice"
"and really, all things considered, I begin to think it perfectly","Pride and Prejudice"
"reasonable. To be sure you know no actual good of me--but nobody thinks","Pride and Prejudice"
"of _that_ when they fall in love.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane, while she was","Pride and Prejudice"
"ill at Netherfield?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her? But make a virtue of it","Pride and Prejudice"
"by all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are","Pride and Prejudice"
"to exaggerate them as much as possible; and, in return, it belongs to me","Pride and Prejudice"
"to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may","Pride and Prejudice"
"be; and I shall begin directly, by asking you what made you so unwilling","Pride and Prejudice"
"to come to the point at last? What made you so shy of me, when you","Pride and Prejudice"
"first called, and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you","Pride and Prejudice"
"called, did you look as if you did not care about me?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no encouragement.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“But I was embarrassed.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“And so was I.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“A man who had felt less might.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give, and that","Pride and Prejudice"
"I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder how long you","Pride and Prejudice"
"_would_ have gone on, if you had been left to yourself. I wonder when","Pride and Prejudice"
"you _would_ have spoken if I had not asked you! My resolution of","Pride and Prejudice"
"thanking you for your kindness to Lydia had certainly great effect. _Too","Pride and Prejudice"
"much_, I am afraid; for what becomes of the moral, if our comfort","Pride and Prejudice"
"springs from a breach of promise, for I ought not to have mentioned the","Pride and Prejudice"
"subject? This will never do.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“You need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly fair. Lady","Pride and Prejudice"
"Catherine’s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of","Pride and Prejudice"
"removing all my doubts. I am not indebted for my present happiness to","Pride and Prejudice"
"your eager desire of expressing your gratitude. I was not in a humour to","Pride and Prejudice"
"wait for an opening of yours. My aunt’s intelligence had given me hope,","Pride and Prejudice"
"and I was determined at once to know everything.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her happy,","Pride and Prejudice"
"for she loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come down to","Pride and Prejudice"
"Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and be embarrassed?","Pride and Prejudice"
"or had you intended any more serious consequences?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could, whether I","Pride and Prejudice"
"might ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or what I avowed to","Pride and Prejudice"
"myself, was to see whether your sister was still partial to Bingley, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"if she were, to make the confession to him which I have since made.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what is to","Pride and Prejudice"
"befall her?”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I am more likely to want time than courage, Elizabeth. But it ought to","Pride and Prejudice"
"be done; and if you will give me a sheet of paper it shall be done","Pride and Prejudice"
"directly.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you, and","Pride and Prejudice"
"admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady once did. But","Pride and Prejudice"
"I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer neglected.”","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"From an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with Mr. Darcy","Pride and Prejudice"
"had been overrated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs. Gardiner’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"long letter; but now, having _that_ to communicate which she knew would","Pride and Prejudice"
"be most welcome, she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt","Pride and Prejudice"
"had already lost three days of happiness, and immediately wrote as","Pride and Prejudice"
"follows:--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to have done,","Pride and Prejudice"
"for your long, kind, satisfactory detail of particulars; but, to say the","Pride and Prejudice"
"truth, I was too cross to write. You supposed more than really existed.","Pride and Prejudice"
"But _now_ suppose as much as you choose; give a loose to your fancy,","Pride and Prejudice"
"indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will","Pride and Prejudice"
"afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot greatly","Pride and Prejudice"
"err. You must write again very soon, and praise him a great deal more","Pride and Prejudice"
"than you did in your last. I thank you again and again, for not going to","Pride and Prejudice"
"the Lakes. How could I be so silly as to wish it! Your idea of the","Pride and Prejudice"
"ponies is delightful. We will go round the park every day. I am the","Pride and Prejudice"
"happiest creature in the world. Perhaps other people have said so","Pride and Prejudice"
"before, but no one with such justice. I am happier even than Jane; she","Pride and Prejudice"
"only smiles, I laugh. Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that","Pride and Prejudice"
"can be spared from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Yours,” etc.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Darcy’s letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style, and still","Pride and Prejudice"
"different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr. Collins, in return","Pride and Prejudice"
"for his last.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"     /* “Dear Sir, */","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"     “I must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will","Pride and Prejudice"
"     soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as","Pride and Prejudice"
"     you can. But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He has","Pride and Prejudice"
"     more to give.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yours sincerely,” etc.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Miss Bingley’s congratulations to her brother on his approaching","Pride and Prejudice"
"marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere. She wrote even to","Pride and Prejudice"
"Jane on the occasion, to express her delight, and repeat all her former","Pride and Prejudice"
"professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but she was affected; and","Pride and Prejudice"
"though feeling no reliance on her, could not help writing her a much","Pride and Prejudice"
"kinder answer than she knew was deserved.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar information was","Pride and Prejudice"
"as sincere as her brother’s in sending it. Four sides of paper were","Pride and Prejudice"
"insufficient to contain all her delight, and all her earnest desire of","Pride and Prejudice"
"being loved by her sister.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any congratulations","Pride and Prejudice"
"to Elizabeth from his wife, the Longbourn family heard that the","Pride and Prejudice"
"Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The reason of this","Pride and Prejudice"
"sudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine had been rendered so","Pride and Prejudice"
"exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephew’s letter, that","Pride and Prejudice"
"Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match, was anxious to get away till","Pride and Prejudice"
"the storm was blown over. At such a moment, the arrival of her friend","Pride and Prejudice"
"was a sincere pleasure to Elizabeth, though in the course of their","Pride and Prejudice"
"meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she","Pride and Prejudice"
"saw Mr. Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her","Pride and Prejudice"
"husband. He bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He could even","Pride and Prejudice"
"listen to Sir William Lucas, when he complimented him on carrying away","Pride and Prejudice"
"the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed his hopes of their all","Pride and Prejudice"
"meeting frequently at St. James’s, with very decent composure. If he did","Pride and Prejudice"
"shrug his shoulders, it was not till Sir William was out of sight.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mrs. Philips’s vulgarity was another, and, perhaps, a greater tax on his","Pride and Prejudice"
"forbearance; and though Mrs. Philips, as well as her sister, stood in","Pride and Prejudice"
"too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which Bingley’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"good-humour encouraged; yet, whenever she _did_ speak, she must be","Pride and Prejudice"
"vulgar. Nor was her respect for him, though it made her more quiet, at","Pride and Prejudice"
"all likely to make her more elegant. Elizabeth did all she could to","Pride and Prejudice"
"shield him from the frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to","Pride and Prejudice"
"keep him to herself, and to those of her family with whom he might","Pride and Prejudice"
"converse without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings","Pride and Prejudice"
"arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its","Pride and Prejudice"
"pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she looked forward","Pride and Prejudice"
"with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so","Pride and Prejudice"
"little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and elegance of their","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"[Illustration]","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs. Bennet got","Pride and Prejudice"
"rid of her two most deserving daughters. With what delighted pride she","Pride and Prejudice"
"afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked of Mrs. Darcy, may be","Pride and Prejudice"
"guessed. I wish I could say, for the sake of her family, that the","Pride and Prejudice"
"accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of","Pride and Prejudice"
"her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible,","Pride and Prejudice"
"amiable, well-informed woman for the rest of her life; though, perhaps,","Pride and Prejudice"
"it was lucky for her husband, who might not have relished domestic","Pride and Prejudice"
"felicity in so unusual a form, that she still was occasionally nervous","Pride and Prejudice"
"and invariably silly.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly; his affection for her","Pride and Prejudice"
"drew him oftener from home than anything else could do. He delighted in","Pride and Prejudice"
"going to Pemberley, especially when he was least expected.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth. So near","Pride and Prejudice"
"a vicinity to her mother and Meryton relations was not desirable even to","Pride and Prejudice"
"_his_ easy temper, or _her_ affectionate heart. The darling wish of his","Pride and Prejudice"
"sisters was then gratified: he bought an estate in a neighbouring county","Pride and Prejudice"
"to Derbyshire; and Jane and Elizabeth, in addition to every other source","Pride and Prejudice"
"of happiness, were within thirty miles of each other.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Kitty, to her very material advantage, spent the chief of her time with","Pride and Prejudice"
"her two elder sisters. In society so superior to what she had generally","Pride and Prejudice"
"known, her improvement was great. She was not of so ungovernable a","Pride and Prejudice"
"temper as Lydia; and, removed from the influence of Lydia’s example, she","Pride and Prejudice"
"became, by proper attention and management, less irritable, less","Pride and Prejudice"
"ignorant, and less insipid. From the further disadvantage of Lydia’s","Pride and Prejudice"
"society she was of course carefully kept; and though Mrs. Wickham","Pride and Prejudice"
"frequently invited her to come and stay with her, with the promise of","Pride and Prejudice"
"balls and young men, her father would never consent to her going.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she was necessarily","Pride and Prejudice"
"drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs. Bennet’s being quite","Pride and Prejudice"
"unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix more with the world, but","Pride and Prejudice"
"she could still moralize over every morning visit; and as she was no","Pride and Prejudice"
"longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters’ beauty and her own,","Pride and Prejudice"
"it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without","Pride and Prejudice"
"much reluctance.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution from","Pride and Prejudice"
"the marriage of her sisters. He bore with philosophy the conviction that","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude","Pride and Prejudice"
"and falsehood had before been unknown to her; and, in spite of","Pride and Prejudice"
"everything, was not wholly without hope that Darcy might yet be","Pride and Prejudice"
"prevailed on to make his fortune. The congratulatory letter which","Pride and Prejudice"
"Elizabeth received from Lydia on her marriage explained to her that, by","Pride and Prejudice"
"his wife at least, if not by himself, such a hope was cherished. The","Pride and Prejudice"
"letter was to this effect:--","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"     /* “My dear Lizzy, */","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"     “I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half so well as I do my dear","Pride and Prejudice"
"     Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to have you","Pride and Prejudice"
"     so rich; and when you have nothing else to do, I hope you will","Pride and Prejudice"
"     think of us. I am sure Wickham would like a place at court very","Pride and Prejudice"
"     much; and I do not think we shall have quite money enough to live","Pride and Prejudice"
"     upon without some help. Any place would do of about three or four","Pride and Prejudice"
"     hundred a year; but, however, do not speak to Mr. Darcy about it,","Pride and Prejudice"
"     if you had rather not.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"“Yours,” etc.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not, she endeavoured in","Pride and Prejudice"
"her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind.","Pride and Prejudice"
"Such relief, however, as it was in her power to afford, by the practice","Pride and Prejudice"
"of what might be called economy in her own private expenses, she","Pride and Prejudice"
"frequently sent them. It had always been evident to her that such an","Pride and Prejudice"
"income as theirs, under the direction of two persons so extravagant in","Pride and Prejudice"
"their wants, and heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to","Pride and Prejudice"
"their support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or","Pride and Prejudice"
"herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards","Pride and Prejudice"
"discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even when the","Pride and Prejudice"
"restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was unsettled in the","Pride and Prejudice"
"extreme. They were always moving from place to place in quest of a","Pride and Prejudice"
"cheap situation, and always spending more than they ought. His affection","Pride and Prejudice"
"for her soon sunk into indifference: hers lasted a little longer; and,","Pride and Prejudice"
"in spite of her youth and her manners, she retained all the claims to","Pride and Prejudice"
"reputation which her marriage had given her. Though Darcy could never","Pride and Prejudice"
"receive _him_ at Pemberley, yet, for Elizabeth’s sake, he assisted him","Pride and Prejudice"
"further in his profession. Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when","Pride and Prejudice"
"her husband was gone to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bingleys they both of them frequently stayed so long, that even","Pride and Prejudice"
"Bingley’s good-humour was overcome, and he proceeded so far as to _talk_","Pride and Prejudice"
"of giving them a hint to be gone.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy’s marriage; but as she","Pride and Prejudice"
"thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at Pemberley, she","Pride and Prejudice"
"dropped all her resentment; was fonder than ever of Georgiana, almost as","Pride and Prejudice"
"attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid off every arrear of civility","Pride and Prejudice"
"to Elizabeth.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Pemberley was now Georgiana’s home; and the attachment of the sisters","Pride and Prejudice"
"was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able to love each","Pride and Prejudice"
"other, even as well as they intended. Georgiana had the highest opinion","Pride and Prejudice"
"in the world of Elizabeth; though at first she often listened with an","Pride and Prejudice"
"astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively, sportive manner of","Pride and Prejudice"
"talking to her brother. He, who had always inspired in herself a respect","Pride and Prejudice"
"which almost overcame her affection, she now saw the object of open","Pride and Prejudice"
"pleasantry. Her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in","Pride and Prejudice"
"her way. By Elizabeth’s instructions she began to comprehend that a","Pride and Prejudice"
"woman may take liberties with her husband, which a brother will not","Pride and Prejudice"
"always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew;","Pride and Prejudice"
"and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character, in","Pride and Prejudice"
"her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement, she sent him","Pride and Prejudice"
"language so very abusive, especially of Elizabeth, that for some time","Pride and Prejudice"
"all intercourse was at an end. But at length, by Elizabeth’s persuasion,","Pride and Prejudice"
"he was prevailed on to overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation;","Pride and Prejudice"
"and, after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt, her","Pride and Prejudice"
"resentment gave way, either to her affection for him, or her curiosity","Pride and Prejudice"
"to see how his wife conducted herself; and she condescended to wait on","Pride and Prejudice"
"them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods had","Pride and Prejudice"
"received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress, but the","Pride and Prejudice"
"visits of her uncle and aunt from the city.","Pride and Prejudice"
"","Pride and Prejudice"
"With the Gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms. Darcy,","Pride and Prejudice"
"as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were both ever","Pride and Prejudice"
"sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who, by bringing","Pride and Prejudice"
"her into Derbyshire, had been the means of uniting them.","Pride and Prejudice"

"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"My father’s family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name Philip, my","Great Expectations"
"infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit","Great Expectations"
"than Pip. So, I called myself Pip, and came to be called Pip.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I give Pirrip as my father’s family name, on the authority of his","Great Expectations"
"tombstone and my sister,—Mrs. Joe Gargery, who married the blacksmith.","Great Expectations"
"As I never saw my father or my mother, and never saw any likeness of","Great Expectations"
"either of them (for their days were long before the days of","Great Expectations"
"photographs), my first fancies regarding what they were like were","Great Expectations"
"unreasonably derived from their tombstones. The shape of the letters on","Great Expectations"
"my father’s, gave me an odd idea that he was a square, stout, dark man,","Great Expectations"
"with curly black hair. From the character and turn of the inscription,","Great Expectations"
"“_Also Georgiana Wife of the Above_,” I drew a childish conclusion that","Great Expectations"
"my mother was freckled and sickly. To five little stone lozenges, each","Great Expectations"
"about a foot and a half long, which were arranged in a neat row beside","Great Expectations"
"their grave, and were sacred to the memory of five little brothers of","Great Expectations"
"mine,—who gave up trying to get a living, exceedingly early in that","Great Expectations"
"universal struggle,—I am indebted for a belief I religiously","Great Expectations"
"entertained that they had all been born on their backs with their hands","Great Expectations"
"in their trousers-pockets, and had never taken them out in this state","Great Expectations"
"of existence.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Ours was the marsh country, down by the river, within, as the river","Great Expectations"
"wound, twenty miles of the sea. My first most vivid and broad","Great Expectations"
"impression of the identity of things seems to me to have been gained on","Great Expectations"
"a memorable raw afternoon towards evening. At such a time I found out","Great Expectations"
"for certain that this bleak place overgrown with nettles was the","Great Expectations"
"churchyard; and that Philip Pirrip, late of this parish, and also","Great Expectations"
"Georgiana wife of the above, were dead and buried; and that Alexander,","Great Expectations"
"Bartholomew, Abraham, Tobias, and Roger, infant children of the","Great Expectations"
"aforesaid, were also dead and buried; and that the dark flat wilderness","Great Expectations"
"beyond the churchyard, intersected with dikes and mounds and gates,","Great Expectations"
"with scattered cattle feeding on it, was the marshes; and that the low","Great Expectations"
"leaden line beyond was the river; and that the distant savage lair from","Great Expectations"
"which the wind was rushing was the sea; and that the small bundle of","Great Expectations"
"shivers growing afraid of it all and beginning to cry, was Pip.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Hold your noise!” cried a terrible voice, as a man started up from","Great Expectations"
"among the graves at the side of the church porch. “Keep still, you","Great Expectations"
"little devil, or I’ll cut your throat!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"A fearful man, all in coarse grey, with a great iron on his leg. A man","Great Expectations"
"with no hat, and with broken shoes, and with an old rag tied round his","Great Expectations"
"head. A man who had been soaked in water, and smothered in mud, and","Great Expectations"
"lamed by stones, and cut by flints, and stung by nettles, and torn by","Great Expectations"
"briars; who limped, and shivered, and glared, and growled; and whose","Great Expectations"
"teeth chattered in his head as he seized me by the chin.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Oh! Don’t cut my throat, sir,” I pleaded in terror. “Pray don’t do it,","Great Expectations"

"“Tell us your name!” said the man. “Quick!”","Great Expectations"

"The man, after looking at me for a moment, turned me upside down, and","Great Expectations"
"emptied my pockets. There was nothing in them but a piece of bread.","Great Expectations"
"When the church came to itself,—for he was so sudden and strong that he","Great Expectations"
"made it go head over heels before me, and I saw the steeple under my","Great Expectations"
"feet,—when the church came to itself, I say, I was seated on a high","Great Expectations"
"tombstone, trembling while he ate the bread ravenously.","Great Expectations"

"","Great Expectations"
"“You young dog,” said the man, licking his lips, “what fat cheeks you","Great Expectations"
"ha’ got.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I believe they were fat, though I was at that time undersized for my","Great Expectations"
"years, and not strong.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Darn me if I couldn’t eat ’em,” said the man, with a threatening shake","Great Expectations"
"of his head, “and if I han’t half a mind to’t!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I earnestly expressed my hope that he wouldn’t, and held tighter to the","Great Expectations"
"tombstone on which he had put me; partly, to keep myself upon it;","Great Expectations"
"partly, to keep myself from crying.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Now lookee here!” said the man. “Where’s your mother?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“There, sir!” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He started, made a short run, and stopped and looked over his shoulder.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“There, sir!” I timidly explained. “Also Georgiana. That’s my mother.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Oh!” said he, coming back. “And is that your father alonger your","Great Expectations"
"mother?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, sir,” said I; “him too; late of this parish.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Ha!” he muttered then, considering. “Who d’ye live with,—supposin’","Great Expectations"
"you’re kindly let to live, which I han’t made up my mind about?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“My sister, sir,—Mrs. Joe Gargery,—wife of Joe Gargery, the blacksmith,","Great Expectations"
"sir.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Blacksmith, eh?” said he. And looked down at his leg.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"After darkly looking at his leg and me several times, he came closer to","Great Expectations"
"my tombstone, took me by both arms, and tilted me back as far as he","Great Expectations"
"could hold me; so that his eyes looked most powerfully down into mine,","Great Expectations"
"and mine looked most helplessly up into his.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Now lookee here,” he said, “the question being whether you’re to be","Great Expectations"
"let to live. You know what a file is?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, sir.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And you know what wittles is?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, sir.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"After each question he tilted me over a little more, so as to give me a","Great Expectations"
"greater sense of helplessness and danger.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You get me a file.” He tilted me again. “And you get me wittles.” He","Great Expectations"
"tilted me again. “You bring ’em both to me.” He tilted me again. “Or","Great Expectations"
"I’ll have your heart and liver out.” He tilted me again.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I was dreadfully frightened, and so giddy that I clung to him with both","Great Expectations"
"hands, and said, “If you would kindly please to let me keep upright,","Great Expectations"
"sir, perhaps I shouldn’t be sick, and perhaps I could attend more.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He gave me a most tremendous dip and roll, so that the church jumped","Great Expectations"
"over its own weathercock. Then, he held me by the arms, in an upright","Great Expectations"
"position on the top of the stone, and went on in these fearful terms:—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You bring me, to-morrow morning early, that file and them wittles. You","Great Expectations"
"bring the lot to me, at that old Battery over yonder. You do it, and","Great Expectations"
"you never dare to say a word or dare to make a sign concerning your","Great Expectations"
"having seen such a person as me, or any person sumever, and you shall","Great Expectations"
"be let to live. You fail, or you go from my words in any partickler, no","Great Expectations"
"matter how small it is, and your heart and your liver shall be tore","Great Expectations"
"out, roasted, and ate. Now, I ain’t alone, as you may think I am.","Great Expectations"
"There’s a young man hid with me, in comparison with which young man I","Great Expectations"
"am a Angel. That young man hears the words I speak. That young man has","Great Expectations"
"a secret way pecooliar to himself, of getting at a boy, and at his","Great Expectations"
"heart, and at his liver. It is in wain for a boy to attempt to hide","Great Expectations"
"himself from that young man. A boy may lock his door, may be warm in","Great Expectations"
"bed, may tuck himself up, may draw the clothes over his head, may think","Great Expectations"
"himself comfortable and safe, but that young man will softly creep and","Great Expectations"
"creep his way to him and tear him open. I am a keeping that young man","Great Expectations"
"from harming of you at the present moment, with great difficulty. I","Great Expectations"
"find it wery hard to hold that young man off of your inside. Now, what","Great Expectations"
"do you say?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I said that I would get him the file, and I would get him what broken","Great Expectations"
"bits of food I could, and I would come to him at the Battery, early in","Great Expectations"
"the morning.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Say Lord strike you dead if you don’t!” said the man.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I said so, and he took me down.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Now,” he pursued, “you remember what you’ve undertook, and you","Great Expectations"
"remember that young man, and you get home!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Goo-good night, sir,” I faltered.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Much of that!” said he, glancing about him over the cold wet flat. “I","Great Expectations"
"wish I was a frog. Or a eel!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"At the same time, he hugged his shuddering body in both his","Great Expectations"
"arms,—clasping himself, as if to hold himself together,—and limped","Great Expectations"
"towards the low church wall. As I saw him go, picking his way among the","Great Expectations"
"nettles, and among the brambles that bound the green mounds, he looked","Great Expectations"
"in my young eyes as if he were eluding the hands of the dead people,","Great Expectations"
"stretching up cautiously out of their graves, to get a twist upon his","Great Expectations"
"ankle and pull him in.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"When he came to the low church wall, he got over it, like a man whose","Great Expectations"
"legs were numbed and stiff, and then turned round to look for me. When","Great Expectations"
"I saw him turning, I set my face towards home, and made the best use of","Great Expectations"
"my legs. But presently I looked over my shoulder, and saw him going on","Great Expectations"
"again towards the river, still hugging himself in both arms, and","Great Expectations"
"picking his way with his sore feet among the great stones dropped into","Great Expectations"
"the marshes here and there, for stepping-places when the rains were","Great Expectations"
"heavy or the tide was in.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The marshes were just a long black horizontal line then, as I stopped","Great Expectations"
"to look after him; and the river was just another horizontal line, not","Great Expectations"
"nearly so broad nor yet so black; and the sky was just a row of long","Great Expectations"
"angry red lines and dense black lines intermixed. On the edge of the","Great Expectations"
"river I could faintly make out the only two black things in all the","Great Expectations"
"prospect that seemed to be standing upright; one of these was the","Great Expectations"
"beacon by which the sailors steered,—like an unhooped cask upon a","Great Expectations"
"pole,—an ugly thing when you were near it; the other, a gibbet, with","Great Expectations"
"some chains hanging to it which had once held a pirate. The man was","Great Expectations"
"limping on towards this latter, as if he were the pirate come to life,","Great Expectations"
"and come down, and going back to hook himself up again. It gave me a","Great Expectations"
"terrible turn when I thought so; and as I saw the cattle lifting their","Great Expectations"
"heads to gaze after him, I wondered whether they thought so too. I","Great Expectations"
"looked all round for the horrible young man, and could see no signs of","Great Expectations"
"him. But now I was frightened again, and ran home without stopping.","Great Expectations"

"Chapter II.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"My sister, Mrs. Joe Gargery, was more than twenty years older than I,","Great Expectations"
"and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbours","Great Expectations"
"because she had brought me up “by hand.” Having at that time to find","Great Expectations"
"out for myself what the expression meant, and knowing her to have a","Great Expectations"
"hard and heavy hand, and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her","Great Expectations"
"husband as well as upon me, I supposed that Joe Gargery and I were both","Great Expectations"
"brought up by hand.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"She was not a good-looking woman, my sister; and I had a general","Great Expectations"
"impression that she must have made Joe Gargery marry her by hand. Joe","Great Expectations"
"was a fair man, with curls of flaxen hair on each side of his smooth","Great Expectations"
"face, and with eyes of such a very undecided blue that they seemed to","Great Expectations"
"have somehow got mixed with their own whites. He was a mild,","Great Expectations"
"good-natured, sweet-tempered, easy-going, foolish, dear fellow,—a sort","Great Expectations"
"of Hercules in strength, and also in weakness.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"My sister, Mrs. Joe, with black hair and eyes, had such a prevailing","Great Expectations"
"redness of skin that I sometimes used to wonder whether it was possible","Great Expectations"
"she washed herself with a nutmeg-grater instead of soap. She was tall","Great Expectations"
"and bony, and almost always wore a coarse apron, fastened over her","Great Expectations"
"figure behind with two loops, and having a square impregnable bib in","Great Expectations"
"front, that was stuck full of pins and needles. She made it a powerful","Great Expectations"
"merit in herself, and a strong reproach against Joe, that she wore this","Great Expectations"
"apron so much. Though I really see no reason why she should have worn","Great Expectations"
"it at all; or why, if she did wear it at all, she should not have taken","Great Expectations"
"it off, every day of her life.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Joe’s forge adjoined our house, which was a wooden house, as many of","Great Expectations"
"the dwellings in our country were,—most of them, at that time. When I","Great Expectations"
"ran home from the churchyard, the forge was shut up, and Joe was","Great Expectations"
"sitting alone in the kitchen. Joe and I being fellow-sufferers, and","Great Expectations"
"having confidences as such, Joe imparted a confidence to me, the moment","Great Expectations"
"I raised the latch of the door and peeped in at him opposite to it,","Great Expectations"
"sitting in the chimney corner.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Mrs. Joe has been out a dozen times, looking for you, Pip. And she’s","Great Expectations"
"out now, making it a baker’s dozen.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Is she?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, Pip,” said Joe; “and what’s worse, she’s got Tickler with her.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"At this dismal intelligence, I twisted the only button on my waistcoat","Great Expectations"
"round and round, and looked in great depression at the fire. Tickler","Great Expectations"
"was a wax-ended piece of cane, worn smooth by collision with my tickled","Great Expectations"
"frame.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“She sot down,” said Joe, “and she got up, and she made a grab at","Great Expectations"
"Tickler, and she Ram-paged out. That’s what she did,” said Joe, slowly","Great Expectations"
"clearing the fire between the lower bars with the poker, and looking at","Great Expectations"
"it; “she Ram-paged out, Pip.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Has she been gone long, Joe?” I always treated him as a larger species","Great Expectations"
"of child, and as no more than my equal.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well,” said Joe, glancing up at the Dutch clock, “she’s been on the","Great Expectations"
"Ram-page, this last spell, about five minutes, Pip. She’s a-coming! Get","Great Expectations"
"behind the door, old chap, and have the jack-towel betwixt you.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I took the advice. My sister, Mrs. Joe, throwing the door wide open,","Great Expectations"
"and finding an obstruction behind it, immediately divined the cause,","Great Expectations"
"and applied Tickler to its further investigation. She concluded by","Great Expectations"
"throwing me—I often served as a connubial missile—at Joe, who, glad to","Great Expectations"
"get hold of me on any terms, passed me on into the chimney and quietly","Great Expectations"
"fenced me up there with his great leg.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Where have you been, you young monkey?” said Mrs. Joe, stamping her","Great Expectations"
"foot. “Tell me directly what you’ve been doing to wear me away with","Great Expectations"
"fret and fright and worrit, or I’d have you out of that corner if you","Great Expectations"
"was fifty Pips, and he was five hundred Gargerys.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I have only been to the churchyard,” said I, from my stool, crying and","Great Expectations"
"rubbing myself.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Churchyard!” repeated my sister. “If it warn’t for me you’d have been","Great Expectations"
"to the churchyard long ago, and stayed there. Who brought you up by","Great Expectations"
"hand?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You did,” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And why did I do it, I should like to know?” exclaimed my sister.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I whimpered, “I don’t know.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“_I_ don’t!” said my sister. “I’d never do it again! I know that. I may","Great Expectations"
"truly say I’ve never had this apron of mine off since born you were.","Great Expectations"
"It’s bad enough to be a blacksmith’s wife (and him a Gargery) without","Great Expectations"
"being your mother.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"My thoughts strayed from that question as I looked disconsolately at","Great Expectations"
"the fire. For the fugitive out on the marshes with the ironed leg, the","Great Expectations"
"mysterious young man, the file, the food, and the dreadful pledge I was","Great Expectations"
"under to commit a larceny on those sheltering premises, rose before me","Great Expectations"
"in the avenging coals.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Hah!” said Mrs. Joe, restoring Tickler to his station. “Churchyard,","Great Expectations"
"indeed! You may well say churchyard, you two.” One of us, by the by,","Great Expectations"
"had not said it at all. “You’ll drive _me_ to the churchyard betwixt","Great Expectations"
"you, one of these days, and O, a pr-r-recious pair you’d be without","Great Expectations"
"me!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As she applied herself to set the tea-things, Joe peeped down at me","Great Expectations"
"over his leg, as if he were mentally casting me and himself up, and","Great Expectations"
"calculating what kind of pair we practically should make, under the","Great Expectations"
"grievous circumstances foreshadowed. After that, he sat feeling his","Great Expectations"
"right-side flaxen curls and whisker, and following Mrs. Joe about with","Great Expectations"
"his blue eyes, as his manner always was at squally times.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"My sister had a trenchant way of cutting our bread and butter for us,","Great Expectations"
"that never varied. First, with her left hand she jammed the loaf hard","Great Expectations"
"and fast against her bib,—where it sometimes got a pin into it, and","Great Expectations"
"sometimes a needle, which we afterwards got into our mouths. Then she","Great Expectations"
"took some butter (not too much) on a knife and spread it on the loaf,","Great Expectations"
"in an apothecary kind of way, as if she were making a plaster,—using","Great Expectations"
"both sides of the knife with a slapping dexterity, and trimming and","Great Expectations"
"moulding the butter off round the crust. Then, she gave the knife a","Great Expectations"
"final smart wipe on the edge of the plaster, and then sawed a very","Great Expectations"
"thick round off the loaf: which she finally, before separating from the","Great Expectations"
"loaf, hewed into two halves, of which Joe got one, and I the other.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"On the present occasion, though I was hungry, I dared not eat my slice.","Great Expectations"
"I felt that I must have something in reserve for my dreadful","Great Expectations"
"acquaintance, and his ally the still more dreadful young man. I knew","Great Expectations"
"Mrs. Joe’s housekeeping to be of the strictest kind, and that my","Great Expectations"
"larcenous researches might find nothing available in the safe.","Great Expectations"
"Therefore I resolved to put my hunk of bread and butter down the leg of","Great Expectations"
"my trousers.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The effort of resolution necessary to the achievement of this purpose I","Great Expectations"
"found to be quite awful. It was as if I had to make up my mind to leap","Great Expectations"
"from the top of a high house, or plunge into a great depth of water.","Great Expectations"
"And it was made the more difficult by the unconscious Joe. In our","Great Expectations"
"already-mentioned freemasonry as fellow-sufferers, and in his","Great Expectations"
"good-natured companionship with me, it was our evening habit to compare","Great Expectations"
"the way we bit through our slices, by silently holding them up to each","Great Expectations"
"other’s admiration now and then,—which stimulated us to new exertions.","Great Expectations"
"To-night, Joe several times invited me, by the display of his fast","Great Expectations"
"diminishing slice, to enter upon our usual friendly competition; but he","Great Expectations"
"found me, each time, with my yellow mug of tea on one knee, and my","Great Expectations"
"untouched bread and butter on the other. At last, I desperately","Great Expectations"
"considered that the thing I contemplated must be done, and that it had","Great Expectations"
"best be done in the least improbable manner consistent with the","Great Expectations"
"circumstances. I took advantage of a moment when Joe had just looked at","Great Expectations"
"me, and got my bread and butter down my leg.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Joe was evidently made uncomfortable by what he supposed to be my loss","Great Expectations"
"of appetite, and took a thoughtful bite out of his slice, which he","Great Expectations"
"didn’t seem to enjoy. He turned it about in his mouth much longer than","Great Expectations"
"usual, pondering over it a good deal, and after all gulped it down like","Great Expectations"
"a pill. He was about to take another bite, and had just got his head on","Great Expectations"
"one side for a good purchase on it, when his eye fell on me, and he saw","Great Expectations"
"that my bread and butter was gone.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The wonder and consternation with which Joe stopped on the threshold of","Great Expectations"
"his bite and stared at me, were too evident to escape my sister’s","Great Expectations"
"observation.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What’s the matter _now_?” said she, smartly, as she put down her cup.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I say, you know!” muttered Joe, shaking his head at me in very serious","Great Expectations"
"remonstrance. “Pip, old chap! You’ll do yourself a mischief. It’ll","Great Expectations"
"stick somewhere. You can’t have chawed it, Pip.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What’s the matter now?” repeated my sister, more sharply than before.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“If you can cough any trifle on it up, Pip, I’d recommend you to do","Great Expectations"
"it,” said Joe, all aghast. “Manners is manners, but still your elth’s","Great Expectations"
"your elth.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"By this time, my sister was quite desperate, so she pounced on Joe,","Great Expectations"
"and, taking him by the two whiskers, knocked his head for a little","Great Expectations"
"while against the wall behind him, while I sat in the corner, looking","Great Expectations"
"guiltily on.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Now, perhaps you’ll mention what’s the matter,” said my sister, out of","Great Expectations"
"breath, “you staring great stuck pig.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Joe looked at her in a helpless way, then took a helpless bite, and","Great Expectations"
"looked at me again.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You know, Pip,” said Joe, solemnly, with his last bite in his cheek,","Great Expectations"
"and speaking in a confidential voice, as if we two were quite alone,","Great Expectations"
"“you and me is always friends, and I’d be the last to tell upon you,","Great Expectations"
"any time. But such a—” he moved his chair and looked about the floor","Great Expectations"
"between us, and then again at me—“such a most oncommon Bolt as that!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Been bolting his food, has he?” cried my sister.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You know, old chap,” said Joe, looking at me, and not at Mrs. Joe,","Great Expectations"
"with his bite still in his cheek, “I Bolted, myself, when I was your","Great Expectations"
"age—frequent—and as a boy I’ve been among a many Bolters; but I never","Great Expectations"
"see your Bolting equal yet, Pip, and it’s a mercy you ain’t Bolted","Great Expectations"
"dead.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"My sister made a dive at me, and fished me up by the hair, saying","Great Expectations"
"nothing more than the awful words, “You come along and be dosed.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Some medical beast had revived Tar-water in those days as a fine","Great Expectations"
"medicine, and Mrs. Joe always kept a supply of it in the cupboard;","Great Expectations"
"having a belief in its virtues correspondent to its nastiness. At the","Great Expectations"
"best of times, so much of this elixir was administered to me as a","Great Expectations"
"choice restorative, that I was conscious of going about, smelling like","Great Expectations"
"a new fence. On this particular evening the urgency of my case demanded","Great Expectations"
"a pint of this mixture, which was poured down my throat, for my greater","Great Expectations"
"comfort, while Mrs. Joe held my head under her arm, as a boot would be","Great Expectations"
"held in a bootjack. Joe got off with half a pint; but was made to","Great Expectations"
"swallow that (much to his disturbance, as he sat slowly munching and","Great Expectations"
"meditating before the fire), “because he had had a turn.” Judging from","Great Expectations"
"myself, I should say he certainly had a turn afterwards, if he had had","Great Expectations"
"none before.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Conscience is a dreadful thing when it accuses man or boy; but when, in","Great Expectations"
"the case of a boy, that secret burden co-operates with another secret","Great Expectations"
"burden down the leg of his trousers, it is (as I can testify) a great","Great Expectations"
"punishment. The guilty knowledge that I was going to rob Mrs. Joe—I","Great Expectations"
"never thought I was going to rob Joe, for I never thought of any of the","Great Expectations"
"housekeeping property as his—united to the necessity of always keeping","Great Expectations"
"one hand on my bread and butter as I sat, or when I was ordered about","Great Expectations"
"the kitchen on any small errand, almost drove me out of my mind. Then,","Great Expectations"
"as the marsh winds made the fire glow and flare, I thought I heard the","Great Expectations"
"voice outside, of the man with the iron on his leg who had sworn me to","Great Expectations"
"secrecy, declaring that he couldn’t and wouldn’t starve until","Great Expectations"
"to-morrow, but must be fed now. At other times, I thought, What if the","Great Expectations"
"young man who was with so much difficulty restrained from imbruing his","Great Expectations"
"hands in me should yield to a constitutional impatience, or should","Great Expectations"
"mistake the time, and should think himself accredited to my heart and","Great Expectations"
"liver to-night, instead of to-morrow! If ever anybody’s hair stood on","Great Expectations"
"end with terror, mine must have done so then. But, perhaps, nobody’s","Great Expectations"
"ever did?","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was Christmas Eve, and I had to stir the pudding for next day, with","Great Expectations"
"a copper-stick, from seven to eight by the Dutch clock. I tried it with","Great Expectations"
"the load upon my leg (and that made me think afresh of the man with the","Great Expectations"
"load on _his_ leg), and found the tendency of exercise to bring the","Great Expectations"
"bread and butter out at my ankle, quite unmanageable. Happily I slipped","Great Expectations"
"away, and deposited that part of my conscience in my garret bedroom.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Hark!” said I, when I had done my stirring, and was taking a final","Great Expectations"
"warm in the chimney corner before being sent up to bed; “was that great","Great Expectations"
"guns, Joe?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Ah!” said Joe. “There’s another conwict off.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What does that mean, Joe?” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mrs. Joe, who always took explanations upon herself, said, snappishly,","Great Expectations"
"“Escaped. Escaped.” Administering the definition like Tar-water.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"While Mrs. Joe sat with her head bending over her needlework, I put my","Great Expectations"
"mouth into the forms of saying to Joe, “What’s a convict?” Joe put","Great Expectations"
"_his_ mouth into the forms of returning such a highly elaborate answer,","Great Expectations"
"that I could make out nothing of it but the single word “Pip.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“There was a conwict off last night,” said Joe, aloud, “after","Great Expectations"
"sunset-gun. And they fired warning of him. And now it appears they’re","Great Expectations"
"firing warning of another.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“_Who’s_ firing?” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Drat that boy,” interposed my sister, frowning at me over her work,","Great Expectations"
"“what a questioner he is. Ask no questions, and you’ll be told no","Great Expectations"
"lies.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was not very polite to herself, I thought, to imply that I should be","Great Expectations"
"told lies by her even if I did ask questions. But she never was polite","Great Expectations"
"unless there was company.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"At this point Joe greatly augmented my curiosity by taking the utmost","Great Expectations"
"pains to open his mouth very wide, and to put it into the form of a","Great Expectations"
"word that looked to me like “sulks.” Therefore, I naturally pointed to","Great Expectations"
"Mrs. Joe, and put my mouth into the form of saying, “her?” But Joe","Great Expectations"
"wouldn’t hear of that, at all, and again opened his mouth very wide,","Great Expectations"
"and shook the form of a most emphatic word out of it. But I could make","Great Expectations"
"nothing of the word.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Mrs. Joe,” said I, as a last resort, “I should like to know—if you","Great Expectations"
"wouldn’t much mind—where the firing comes from?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Lord bless the boy!” exclaimed my sister, as if she didn’t quite mean","Great Expectations"
"that but rather the contrary. “From the Hulks!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Oh-h!” said I, looking at Joe. “Hulks!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Joe gave a reproachful cough, as much as to say, “Well, I told you so.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And please, what’s Hulks?” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“That’s the way with this boy!” exclaimed my sister, pointing me out","Great Expectations"
"with her needle and thread, and shaking her head at me. “Answer him one","Great Expectations"
"question, and he’ll ask you a dozen directly. Hulks are prison-ships,","Great Expectations"
"right ’cross th’ meshes.” We always used that name for marshes, in our","Great Expectations"
"country.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I wonder who’s put into prison-ships, and why they’re put there?” said","Great Expectations"
"I, in a general way, and with quiet desperation.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was too much for Mrs. Joe, who immediately rose. “I tell you what,","Great Expectations"
"young fellow,” said she, “I didn’t bring you up by hand to badger","Great Expectations"
"people’s lives out. It would be blame to me and not praise, if I had.","Great Expectations"
"People are put in the Hulks because they murder, and because they rob,","Great Expectations"
"and forge, and do all sorts of bad; and they always begin by asking","Great Expectations"
"questions. Now, you get along to bed!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I was never allowed a candle to light me to bed, and, as I went","Great Expectations"
"upstairs in the dark, with my head tingling,—from Mrs. Joe’s thimble","Great Expectations"
"having played the tambourine upon it, to accompany her last words,—I","Great Expectations"
"felt fearfully sensible of the great convenience that the hulks were","Great Expectations"
"handy for me. I was clearly on my way there. I had begun by asking","Great Expectations"
"questions, and I was going to rob Mrs. Joe.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Since that time, which is far enough away now, I have often thought","Great Expectations"
"that few people know what secrecy there is in the young under terror.","Great Expectations"
"No matter how unreasonable the terror, so that it be terror. I was in","Great Expectations"
"mortal terror of the young man who wanted my heart and liver; I was in","Great Expectations"
"mortal terror of my interlocutor with the iron leg; I was in mortal","Great Expectations"
"terror of myself, from whom an awful promise had been extracted; I had","Great Expectations"
"no hope of deliverance through my all-powerful sister, who repulsed me","Great Expectations"
"at every turn; I am afraid to think of what I might have done on","Great Expectations"
"requirement, in the secrecy of my terror.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"If I slept at all that night, it was only to imagine myself drifting","Great Expectations"
"down the river on a strong spring-tide, to the Hulks; a ghostly pirate","Great Expectations"
"calling out to me through a speaking-trumpet, as I passed the","Great Expectations"
"gibbet-station, that I had better come ashore and be hanged there at","Great Expectations"
"once, and not put it off. I was afraid to sleep, even if I had been","Great Expectations"
"inclined, for I knew that at the first faint dawn of morning I must rob","Great Expectations"
"the pantry. There was no doing it in the night, for there was no","Great Expectations"
"getting a light by easy friction then; to have got one I must have","Great Expectations"
"struck it out of flint and steel, and have made a noise like the very","Great Expectations"
"pirate himself rattling his chains.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As soon as the great black velvet pall outside my little window was","Great Expectations"
"shot with grey, I got up and went downstairs; every board upon the way,","Great Expectations"
"and every crack in every board calling after me, “Stop thief!” and “Get","Great Expectations"
"up, Mrs. Joe!” In the pantry, which was far more abundantly supplied","Great Expectations"
"than usual, owing to the season, I was very much alarmed by a hare","Great Expectations"
"hanging up by the heels, whom I rather thought I caught, when my back","Great Expectations"
"was half turned, winking. I had no time for verification, no time for","Great Expectations"
"selection, no time for anything, for I had no time to spare. I stole","Great Expectations"
"some bread, some rind of cheese, about half a jar of mincemeat (which I","Great Expectations"
"tied up in my pocket-handkerchief with my last night’s slice), some","Great Expectations"
"brandy from a stone bottle (which I decanted into a glass bottle I had","Great Expectations"
"secretly used for making that intoxicating fluid,","Great Expectations"
"Spanish-liquorice-water, up in my room: diluting the stone bottle from","Great Expectations"
"a jug in the kitchen cupboard), a meat bone with very little on it, and","Great Expectations"
"a beautiful round compact pork pie. I was nearly going away without the","Great Expectations"
"pie, but I was tempted to mount upon a shelf, to look what it was that","Great Expectations"
"was put away so carefully in a covered earthenware dish in a corner,","Great Expectations"
"and I found it was the pie, and I took it in the hope that it was not","Great Expectations"
"intended for early use, and would not be missed for some time.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"There was a door in the kitchen, communicating with the forge; I","Great Expectations"
"unlocked and unbolted that door, and got a file from among Joe’s tools.","Great Expectations"
"Then I put the fastenings as I had found them, opened the door at which","Great Expectations"
"I had entered when I ran home last night, shut it, and ran for the","Great Expectations"
"misty marshes.","Great Expectations"

"Chapter III.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was a rimy morning, and very damp. I had seen the damp lying on the","Great Expectations"
"outside of my little window, as if some goblin had been crying there","Great Expectations"
"all night, and using the window for a pocket-handkerchief. Now, I saw","Great Expectations"
"the damp lying on the bare hedges and spare grass, like a coarser sort","Great Expectations"
"of spiders’ webs; hanging itself from twig to twig and blade to blade.","Great Expectations"
"On every rail and gate, wet lay clammy, and the marsh mist was so","Great Expectations"
"thick, that the wooden finger on the post directing people to our","Great Expectations"
"village—a direction which they never accepted, for they never came","Great Expectations"
"there—was invisible to me until I was quite close under it. Then, as I","Great Expectations"
"looked up at it, while it dripped, it seemed to my oppressed conscience","Great Expectations"
"like a phantom devoting me to the Hulks.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The mist was heavier yet when I got out upon the marshes, so that","Great Expectations"
"instead of my running at everything, everything seemed to run at me.","Great Expectations"
"This was very disagreeable to a guilty mind. The gates and dikes and","Great Expectations"
"banks came bursting at me through the mist, as if they cried as plainly","Great Expectations"
"as could be, “A boy with somebody else’s pork pie! Stop him!” The","Great Expectations"
"cattle came upon me with like suddenness, staring out of their eyes,","Great Expectations"
"and steaming out of their nostrils, “Halloa, young thief!” One black","Great Expectations"
"ox, with a white cravat on,—who even had to my awakened conscience","Great Expectations"
"something of a clerical air,—fixed me so obstinately with his eyes, and","Great Expectations"
"moved his blunt head round in such an accusatory manner as I moved","Great Expectations"
"round, that I blubbered out to him, “I couldn’t help it, sir! It wasn’t","Great Expectations"
"for myself I took it!” Upon which he put down his head, blew a cloud of","Great Expectations"
"smoke out of his nose, and vanished with a kick-up of his hind-legs and","Great Expectations"
"a flourish of his tail.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"All this time, I was getting on towards the river; but however fast I","Great Expectations"
"went, I couldn’t warm my feet, to which the damp cold seemed riveted,","Great Expectations"
"as the iron was riveted to the leg of the man I was running to meet. I","Great Expectations"
"knew my way to the Battery, pretty straight, for I had been down there","Great Expectations"
"on a Sunday with Joe, and Joe, sitting on an old gun, had told me that","Great Expectations"
"when I was ’prentice to him, regularly bound, we would have such Larks","Great Expectations"
"there! However, in the confusion of the mist, I found myself at last","Great Expectations"
"too far to the right, and consequently had to try back along the","Great Expectations"
"river-side, on the bank of loose stones above the mud and the stakes","Great Expectations"
"that staked the tide out. Making my way along here with all despatch, I","Great Expectations"
"had just crossed a ditch which I knew to be very near the Battery, and","Great Expectations"
"had just scrambled up the mound beyond the ditch, when I saw the man","Great Expectations"
"sitting before me. His back was towards me, and he had his arms folded,","Great Expectations"
"and was nodding forward, heavy with sleep.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I thought he would be more glad if I came upon him with his breakfast,","Great Expectations"
"in that unexpected manner, so I went forward softly and touched him on","Great Expectations"
"the shoulder. He instantly jumped up, and it was not the same man, but","Great Expectations"
"another man!","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"And yet this man was dressed in coarse grey, too, and had a great iron","Great Expectations"
"on his leg, and was lame, and hoarse, and cold, and was everything that","Great Expectations"
"the other man was; except that he had not the same face, and had a flat","Great Expectations"
"broad-brimmed low-crowned felt hat on. All this I saw in a moment, for","Great Expectations"
"I had only a moment to see it in: he swore an oath at me, made a hit at","Great Expectations"
"me,—it was a round weak blow that missed me and almost knocked himself","Great Expectations"
"down, for it made him stumble,—and then he ran into the mist, stumbling","Great Expectations"
"twice as he went, and I lost him.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It’s the young man!” I thought, feeling my heart shoot as I identified","Great Expectations"
"him. I dare say I should have felt a pain in my liver, too, if I had","Great Expectations"
"known where it was.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I was soon at the Battery after that, and there was the right","Great Expectations"
"man,—hugging himself and limping to and fro, as if he had never all","Great Expectations"
"night left off hugging and limping,—waiting for me. He was awfully","Great Expectations"
"cold, to be sure. I half expected to see him drop down before my face","Great Expectations"
"and die of deadly cold. His eyes looked so awfully hungry too, that","Great Expectations"
"when I handed him the file and he laid it down on the grass, it","Great Expectations"
"occurred to me he would have tried to eat it, if he had not seen my","Great Expectations"
"bundle. He did not turn me upside down this time to get at what I had,","Great Expectations"
"but left me right side upwards while I opened the bundle and emptied my","Great Expectations"
"pockets.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What’s in the bottle, boy?” said he.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Brandy,” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He was already handing mincemeat down his throat in the most curious","Great Expectations"
"manner,—more like a man who was putting it away somewhere in a violent","Great Expectations"
"hurry, than a man who was eating it,—but he left off to take some of","Great Expectations"
"the liquor. He shivered all the while so violently, that it was quite","Great Expectations"
"as much as he could do to keep the neck of the bottle between his","Great Expectations"
"teeth, without biting it off.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I think you have got the ague,” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I’m much of your opinion, boy,” said he.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It’s bad about here,” I told him. “You’ve been lying out on the","Great Expectations"
"meshes, and they’re dreadful aguish. Rheumatic too.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I’ll eat my breakfast afore they’re the death of me,” said he. “I’d do","Great Expectations"
"that, if I was going to be strung up to that there gallows as there is","Great Expectations"
"over there, directly afterwards. I’ll beat the shivers so far, I’ll bet","Great Expectations"
"you.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He was gobbling mincemeat, meatbone, bread, cheese, and pork pie, all","Great Expectations"
"at once: staring distrustfully while he did so at the mist all round","Great Expectations"
"us, and often stopping—even stopping his jaws—to listen. Some real or","Great Expectations"
"fancied sound, some clink upon the river or breathing of beast upon the","Great Expectations"
"marsh, now gave him a start, and he said, suddenly,—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You’re not a deceiving imp? You brought no one with you?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No, sir! No!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Nor giv’ no one the office to follow you?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well,” said he, “I believe you. You’d be but a fierce young hound","Great Expectations"
"indeed, if at your time of life you could help to hunt a wretched","Great Expectations"
"warmint hunted as near death and dunghill as this poor wretched warmint","Great Expectations"
"is!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Something clicked in his throat as if he had works in him like a clock,","Great Expectations"
"and was going to strike. And he smeared his ragged rough sleeve over","Great Expectations"
"his eyes.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Pitying his desolation, and watching him as he gradually settled down","Great Expectations"
"upon the pie, I made bold to say, “I am glad you enjoy it.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Did you speak?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I said I was glad you enjoyed it.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Thankee, my boy. I do.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I had often watched a large dog of ours eating his food; and I now","Great Expectations"
"noticed a decided similarity between the dog’s way of eating, and the","Great Expectations"
"man’s. The man took strong sharp sudden bites, just like the dog. He","Great Expectations"
"swallowed, or rather snapped up, every mouthful, too soon and too fast;","Great Expectations"
"and he looked sideways here and there while he ate, as if he thought","Great Expectations"
"there was danger in every direction of somebody’s coming to take the","Great Expectations"
"pie away. He was altogether too unsettled in his mind over it, to","Great Expectations"
"appreciate it comfortably I thought, or to have anybody to dine with","Great Expectations"
"him, without making a chop with his jaws at the visitor. In all of","Great Expectations"
"which particulars he was very like the dog.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I am afraid you won’t leave any of it for him,” said I, timidly; after","Great Expectations"
"a silence during which I had hesitated as to the politeness of making","Great Expectations"
"the remark. “There’s no more to be got where that came from.” It was","Great Expectations"
"the certainty of this fact that impelled me to offer the hint.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Leave any for him? Who’s him?” said my friend, stopping in his","Great Expectations"
"crunching of pie-crust.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“The young man. That you spoke of. That was hid with you.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Oh ah!” he returned, with something like a gruff laugh. “Him? Yes,","Great Expectations"
"yes! _He_ don’t want no wittles.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I thought he looked as if he did,” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The man stopped eating, and regarded me with the keenest scrutiny and","Great Expectations"
"the greatest surprise.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Looked? When?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Just now.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Where?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yonder,” said I, pointing; “over there, where I found him nodding","Great Expectations"
"asleep, and thought it was you.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He held me by the collar and stared at me so, that I began to think his","Great Expectations"
"first idea about cutting my throat had revived.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Dressed like you, you know, only with a hat,” I explained, trembling;","Great Expectations"
"“and—and”—I was very anxious to put this delicately—“and with—the same","Great Expectations"
"reason for wanting to borrow a file. Didn’t you hear the cannon last","Great Expectations"
"night?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Then there _was_ firing!” he said to himself.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I wonder you shouldn’t have been sure of that,” I returned, “for we","Great Expectations"
"heard it up at home, and that’s farther away, and we were shut in","Great Expectations"
"besides.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Why, see now!” said he. “When a man’s alone on these flats, with a","Great Expectations"
"light head and a light stomach, perishing of cold and want, he hears","Great Expectations"
"nothin’ all night, but guns firing, and voices calling. Hears? He sees","Great Expectations"
"the soldiers, with their red coats lighted up by the torches carried","Great Expectations"
"afore, closing in round him. Hears his number called, hears himself","Great Expectations"
"challenged, hears the rattle of the muskets, hears the orders ‘Make","Great Expectations"
"ready! Present! Cover him steady, men!’ and is laid hands on—and","Great Expectations"
"there’s nothin’! Why, if I see one pursuing party last night—coming up","Great Expectations"
"in order, Damn ’em, with their tramp, tramp—I see a hundred. And as to","Great Expectations"
"firing! Why, I see the mist shake with the cannon, arter it was broad","Great Expectations"
"day,—But this man”; he had said all the rest, as if he had forgotten my","Great Expectations"
"being there; “did you notice anything in him?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“He had a badly bruised face,” said I, recalling what I hardly knew I","Great Expectations"
"knew.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Not here?” exclaimed the man, striking his left cheek mercilessly,","Great Expectations"
"with the flat of his hand.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, there!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Where is he?” He crammed what little food was left, into the breast of","Great Expectations"
"his grey jacket. “Show me the way he went. I’ll pull him down, like a","Great Expectations"
"bloodhound. Curse this iron on my sore leg! Give us hold of the file,","Great Expectations"
"boy.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I indicated in what direction the mist had shrouded the other man, and","Great Expectations"
"he looked up at it for an instant. But he was down on the rank wet","Great Expectations"
"grass, filing at his iron like a madman, and not minding me or minding","Great Expectations"
"his own leg, which had an old chafe upon it and was bloody, but which","Great Expectations"
"he handled as roughly as if it had no more feeling in it than the file.","Great Expectations"
"I was very much afraid of him again, now that he had worked himself","Great Expectations"
"into this fierce hurry, and I was likewise very much afraid of keeping","Great Expectations"
"away from home any longer. I told him I must go, but he took no notice,","Great Expectations"
"so I thought the best thing I could do was to slip off. The last I saw","Great Expectations"
"of him, his head was bent over his knee and he was working hard at his","Great Expectations"
"fetter, muttering impatient imprecations at it and at his leg. The last","Great Expectations"
"I heard of him, I stopped in the mist to listen, and the file was still","Great Expectations"
"going.","Great Expectations"

"Chapter IV.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I fully expected to find a Constable in the kitchen, waiting to take me","Great Expectations"
"up. But not only was there no Constable there, but no discovery had yet","Great Expectations"
"been made of the robbery. Mrs. Joe was prodigiously busy in getting the","Great Expectations"
"house ready for the festivities of the day, and Joe had been put upon","Great Expectations"
"the kitchen doorstep to keep him out of the dust-pan,—an article into","Great Expectations"
"which his destiny always led him, sooner or later, when my sister was","Great Expectations"
"vigorously reaping the floors of her establishment.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And where the deuce ha’ _you_ been?” was Mrs. Joe’s Christmas","Great Expectations"
"salutation, when I and my conscience showed ourselves.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I said I had been down to hear the Carols. “Ah! well!” observed Mrs.","Great Expectations"
"Joe. “You might ha’ done worse.” Not a doubt of that I thought.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Perhaps if I warn’t a blacksmith’s wife, and (what’s the same thing) a","Great Expectations"
"slave with her apron never off, _I_ should have been to hear the","Great Expectations"
"Carols,” said Mrs. Joe. “I’m rather partial to Carols, myself, and","Great Expectations"
"that’s the best of reasons for my never hearing any.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Joe, who had ventured into the kitchen after me as the dustpan had","Great Expectations"
"retired before us, drew the back of his hand across his nose with a","Great Expectations"
"conciliatory air, when Mrs. Joe darted a look at him, and, when her","Great Expectations"
"eyes were withdrawn, secretly crossed his two forefingers, and","Great Expectations"
"exhibited them to me, as our token that Mrs. Joe was in a cross temper.","Great Expectations"
"This was so much her normal state, that Joe and I would often, for","Great Expectations"
"weeks together, be, as to our fingers, like monumental Crusaders as to","Great Expectations"
"their legs.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We were to have a superb dinner, consisting of a leg of pickled pork","Great Expectations"
"and greens, and a pair of roast stuffed fowls. A handsome mince-pie had","Great Expectations"
"been made yesterday morning (which accounted for the mincemeat not","Great Expectations"
"being missed), and the pudding was already on the boil. These extensive","Great Expectations"
"arrangements occasioned us to be cut off unceremoniously in respect of","Great Expectations"
"breakfast; “for I ain’t,” said Mrs. Joe,—“I ain’t a-going to have no","Great Expectations"
"formal cramming and busting and washing up now, with what I’ve got","Great Expectations"
"before me, I promise you!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"So, we had our slices served out, as if we were two thousand troops on","Great Expectations"
"a forced march instead of a man and boy at home; and we took gulps of","Great Expectations"
"milk and water, with apologetic countenances, from a jug on the","Great Expectations"
"dresser. In the meantime, Mrs. Joe put clean white curtains up, and","Great Expectations"
"tacked a new flowered flounce across the wide chimney to replace the","Great Expectations"
"old one, and uncovered the little state parlour across the passage,","Great Expectations"
"which was never uncovered at any other time, but passed the rest of the","Great Expectations"
"year in a cool haze of silver paper, which even extended to the four","Great Expectations"
"little white crockery poodles on the mantel-shelf, each with a black","Great Expectations"
"nose and a basket of flowers in his mouth, and each the counterpart of","Great Expectations"
"the other. Mrs. Joe was a very clean housekeeper, but had an exquisite","Great Expectations"
"art of making her cleanliness more uncomfortable and unacceptable than","Great Expectations"
"dirt itself. Cleanliness is next to Godliness, and some people do the","Great Expectations"
"same by their religion.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"My sister, having so much to do, was going to church vicariously, that","Great Expectations"
"is to say, Joe and I were going. In his working-clothes, Joe was a","Great Expectations"
"well-knit characteristic-looking blacksmith; in his holiday clothes, he","Great Expectations"
"was more like a scarecrow in good circumstances, than anything else.","Great Expectations"
"Nothing that he wore then fitted him or seemed to belong to him; and","Great Expectations"
"everything that he wore then grazed him. On the present festive","Great Expectations"
"occasion he emerged from his room, when the blithe bells were going,","Great Expectations"
"the picture of misery, in a full suit of Sunday penitentials. As to me,","Great Expectations"
"I think my sister must have had some general idea that I was a young","Great Expectations"
"offender whom an Accoucheur Policeman had taken up (on my birthday) and","Great Expectations"
"delivered over to her, to be dealt with according to the outraged","Great Expectations"
"majesty of the law. I was always treated as if I had insisted on being","Great Expectations"
"born in opposition to the dictates of reason, religion, and morality,","Great Expectations"
"and against the dissuading arguments of my best friends. Even when I","Great Expectations"
"was taken to have a new suit of clothes, the tailor had orders to make","Great Expectations"
"them like a kind of Reformatory, and on no account to let me have the","Great Expectations"
"free use of my limbs.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Joe and I going to church, therefore, must have been a moving spectacle","Great Expectations"
"for compassionate minds. Yet, what I suffered outside was nothing to","Great Expectations"
"what I underwent within. The terrors that had assailed me whenever Mrs.","Great Expectations"
"Joe had gone near the pantry, or out of the room, were only to be","Great Expectations"
"equalled by the remorse with which my mind dwelt on what my hands had","Great Expectations"
"done. Under the weight of my wicked secret, I pondered whether the","Great Expectations"
"Church would be powerful enough to shield me from the vengeance of the","Great Expectations"
"terrible young man, if I divulged to that establishment. I conceived","Great Expectations"
"the idea that the time when the banns were read and when the clergyman","Great Expectations"
"said, “Ye are now to declare it!” would be the time for me to rise and","Great Expectations"
"propose a private conference in the vestry. I am far from being sure","Great Expectations"
"that I might not have astonished our small congregation by resorting to","Great Expectations"
"this extreme measure, but for its being Christmas Day and no Sunday.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Wopsle, the clerk at church, was to dine with us; and Mr. Hubble","Great Expectations"
"the wheelwright and Mrs. Hubble; and Uncle Pumblechook (Joe’s uncle,","Great Expectations"
"but Mrs. Joe appropriated him), who was a well-to-do cornchandler in","Great Expectations"
"the nearest town, and drove his own chaise-cart. The dinner hour was","Great Expectations"
"half-past one. When Joe and I got home, we found the table laid, and","Great Expectations"
"Mrs. Joe dressed, and the dinner dressing, and the front door unlocked","Great Expectations"
"(it never was at any other time) for the company to enter by, and","Great Expectations"
"everything most splendid. And still, not a word of the robbery.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The time came, without bringing with it any relief to my feelings, and","Great Expectations"
"the company came. Mr. Wopsle, united to a Roman nose and a large","Great Expectations"
"shining bald forehead, had a deep voice which he was uncommonly proud","Great Expectations"
"of; indeed it was understood among his acquaintance that if you could","Great Expectations"
"only give him his head, he would read the clergyman into fits; he","Great Expectations"
"himself confessed that if the Church was “thrown open,” meaning to","Great Expectations"
"competition, he would not despair of making his mark in it. The Church","Great Expectations"
"not being “thrown open,” he was, as I have said, our clerk. But he","Great Expectations"
"punished the Amens tremendously; and when he gave out the psalm,—always","Great Expectations"
"giving the whole verse,—he looked all round the congregation first, as","Great Expectations"
"much as to say, “You have heard my friend overhead; oblige me with your","Great Expectations"
"opinion of this style!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I opened the door to the company,—making believe that it was a habit of","Great Expectations"
"ours to open that door,—and I opened it first to Mr. Wopsle, next to","Great Expectations"
"Mr. and Mrs. Hubble, and last of all to Uncle Pumblechook. N.B. _I_ was","Great Expectations"
"not allowed to call him uncle, under the severest penalties.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Mrs. Joe,” said Uncle Pumblechook, a large hard-breathing middle-aged","Great Expectations"
"slow man, with a mouth like a fish, dull staring eyes, and sandy hair","Great Expectations"
"standing upright on his head, so that he looked as if he had just been","Great Expectations"
"all but choked, and had that moment come to, “I have brought you as the","Great Expectations"
"compliments of the season—I have brought you, Mum, a bottle of sherry","Great Expectations"
"wine—and I have brought you, Mum, a bottle of port wine.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Every Christmas Day he presented himself, as a profound novelty, with","Great Expectations"
"exactly the same words, and carrying the two bottles like dumb-bells.","Great Expectations"
"Every Christmas Day, Mrs. Joe replied, as she now replied, “O, Un—cle","Great Expectations"
"Pum-ble—chook! This _is_ kind!” Every Christmas Day, he retorted, as he","Great Expectations"
"now retorted, “It’s no more than your merits. And now are you all","Great Expectations"
"bobbish, and how’s Sixpennorth of halfpence?” meaning me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We dined on these occasions in the kitchen, and adjourned, for the nuts","Great Expectations"
"and oranges and apples to the parlour; which was a change very like","Great Expectations"
"Joe’s change from his working-clothes to his Sunday dress. My sister","Great Expectations"
"was uncommonly lively on the present occasion, and indeed was generally","Great Expectations"
"more gracious in the society of Mrs. Hubble than in other company. I","Great Expectations"
"remember Mrs. Hubble as a little curly sharp-edged person in sky-blue,","Great Expectations"
"who held a conventionally juvenile position, because she had married","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Hubble,—I don’t know at what remote period,—when she was much","Great Expectations"
"younger than he. I remember Mr Hubble as a tough, high-shouldered,","Great Expectations"
"stooping old man, of a sawdusty fragrance, with his legs","Great Expectations"
"extraordinarily wide apart: so that in my short days I always saw some","Great Expectations"
"miles of open country between them when I met him coming up the lane.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Among this good company I should have felt myself, even if I hadn’t","Great Expectations"
"robbed the pantry, in a false position. Not because I was squeezed in","Great Expectations"
"at an acute angle of the tablecloth, with the table in my chest, and","Great Expectations"
"the Pumblechookian elbow in my eye, nor because I was not allowed to","Great Expectations"
"speak (I didn’t want to speak), nor because I was regaled with the","Great Expectations"
"scaly tips of the drumsticks of the fowls, and with those obscure","Great Expectations"
"corners of pork of which the pig, when living, had had the least reason","Great Expectations"
"to be vain. No; I should not have minded that, if they would only have","Great Expectations"
"left me alone. But they wouldn’t leave me alone. They seemed to think","Great Expectations"
"the opportunity lost, if they failed to point the conversation at me,","Great Expectations"
"every now and then, and stick the point into me. I might have been an","Great Expectations"
"unfortunate little bull in a Spanish arena, I got so smartingly touched","Great Expectations"
"up by these moral goads.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It began the moment we sat down to dinner. Mr. Wopsle said grace with","Great Expectations"
"theatrical declamation,—as it now appears to me, something like a","Great Expectations"
"religious cross of the Ghost in Hamlet with Richard the Third,—and","Great Expectations"
"ended with the very proper aspiration that we might be truly grateful.","Great Expectations"
"Upon which my sister fixed me with her eye, and said, in a low","Great Expectations"
"reproachful voice, “Do you hear that? Be grateful.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Especially,” said Mr. Pumblechook, “be grateful, boy, to them which","Great Expectations"
"brought you up by hand.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mrs. Hubble shook her head, and contemplating me with a mournful","Great Expectations"
"presentiment that I should come to no good, asked, “Why is it that the","Great Expectations"
"young are never grateful?” This moral mystery seemed too much for the","Great Expectations"
"company until Mr. Hubble tersely solved it by saying, “Naterally","Great Expectations"
"wicious.” Everybody then murmured “True!” and looked at me in a","Great Expectations"
"particularly unpleasant and personal manner.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Joe’s station and influence were something feebler (if possible) when","Great Expectations"
"there was company than when there was none. But he always aided and","Great Expectations"
"comforted me when he could, in some way of his own, and he always did","Great Expectations"
"so at dinner-time by giving me gravy, if there were any. There being","Great Expectations"
"plenty of gravy to-day, Joe spooned into my plate, at this point, about","Great Expectations"
"half a pint.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"A little later on in the dinner, Mr. Wopsle reviewed the sermon with","Great Expectations"
"some severity, and intimated—in the usual hypothetical case of the","Great Expectations"
"Church being “thrown open”—what kind of sermon _he_ would have given","Great Expectations"
"them. After favouring them with some heads of that discourse, he","Great Expectations"
"remarked that he considered the subject of the day’s homily, ill","Great Expectations"
"chosen; which was the less excusable, he added, when there were so many","Great Expectations"
"subjects “going about.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“True again,” said Uncle Pumblechook. “You’ve hit it, sir! Plenty of","Great Expectations"
"subjects going about, for them that know how to put salt upon their","Great Expectations"
"tails. That’s what’s wanted. A man needn’t go far to find a subject, if","Great Expectations"
"he’s ready with his salt-box.” Mr. Pumblechook added, after a short","Great Expectations"
"interval of reflection, “Look at Pork alone. There’s a subject! If you","Great Expectations"
"want a subject, look at Pork!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“True, sir. Many a moral for the young,” returned Mr. Wopsle,—and I","Great Expectations"
"knew he was going to lug me in, before he said it; “might be deduced","Great Expectations"
"from that text.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"(“You listen to this,” said my sister to me, in a severe parenthesis.)","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Joe gave me some more gravy.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Swine,” pursued Mr. Wopsle, in his deepest voice, and pointing his","Great Expectations"
"fork at my blushes, as if he were mentioning my Christian name,—“swine","Great Expectations"
"were the companions of the prodigal. The gluttony of Swine is put","Great Expectations"
"before us, as an example to the young.” (I thought this pretty well in","Great Expectations"
"him who had been praising up the pork for being so plump and juicy.)","Great Expectations"
"“What is detestable in a pig is more detestable in a boy.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Or girl,” suggested Mr. Hubble.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Of course, or girl, Mr. Hubble,” assented Mr. Wopsle, rather","Great Expectations"
"irritably, “but there is no girl present.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Besides,” said Mr. Pumblechook, turning sharp on me, “think what","Great Expectations"
"you’ve got to be grateful for. If you’d been born a Squeaker—”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“He _was_, if ever a child was,” said my sister, most emphatically.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Joe gave me some more gravy.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well, but I mean a four-footed Squeaker,” said Mr. Pumblechook. “If","Great Expectations"
"you had been born such, would you have been here now? Not you—”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Unless in that form,” said Mr. Wopsle, nodding towards the dish.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“But I don’t mean in that form, sir,” returned Mr. Pumblechook, who had","Great Expectations"
"an objection to being interrupted; “I mean, enjoying himself with his","Great Expectations"
"elders and betters, and improving himself with their conversation, and","Great Expectations"
"rolling in the lap of luxury. Would he have been doing that? No, he","Great Expectations"
"wouldn’t. And what would have been your destination?” turning on me","Great Expectations"
"again. “You would have been disposed of for so many shillings according","Great Expectations"
"to the market price of the article, and Dunstable the butcher would","Great Expectations"
"have come up to you as you lay in your straw, and he would have whipped","Great Expectations"
"you under his left arm, and with his right he would have tucked up his","Great Expectations"
"frock to get a penknife from out of his waistcoat-pocket, and he would","Great Expectations"
"have shed your blood and had your life. No bringing up by hand then.","Great Expectations"
"Not a bit of it!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Joe offered me more gravy, which I was afraid to take.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“He was a world of trouble to you, ma’am,” said Mrs. Hubble,","Great Expectations"
"commiserating my sister.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Trouble?” echoed my sister; “trouble?” and then entered on a fearful","Great Expectations"
"catalogue of all the illnesses I had been guilty of, and all the acts","Great Expectations"
"of sleeplessness I had committed, and all the high places I had tumbled","Great Expectations"
"from, and all the low places I had tumbled into, and all the injuries I","Great Expectations"
"had done myself, and all the times she had wished me in my grave, and I","Great Expectations"
"had contumaciously refused to go there.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I think the Romans must have aggravated one another very much, with","Great Expectations"
"their noses. Perhaps, they became the restless people they were, in","Great Expectations"
"consequence. Anyhow, Mr. Wopsle’s Roman nose so aggravated me, during","Great Expectations"
"the recital of my misdemeanours, that I should have liked to pull it","Great Expectations"
"until he howled. But, all I had endured up to this time was nothing in","Great Expectations"
"comparison with the awful feelings that took possession of me when the","Great Expectations"
"pause was broken which ensued upon my sister’s recital, and in which","Great Expectations"
"pause everybody had looked at me (as I felt painfully conscious) with","Great Expectations"
"indignation and abhorrence.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yet,” said Mr. Pumblechook, leading the company gently back to the","Great Expectations"
"theme from which they had strayed, “Pork—regarded as biled—is rich,","Great Expectations"
"too; ain’t it?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Have a little brandy, uncle,” said my sister.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"O Heavens, it had come at last! He would find it was weak, he would say","Great Expectations"
"it was weak, and I was lost! I held tight to the leg of the table under","Great Expectations"
"the cloth, with both hands, and awaited my fate.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"My sister went for the stone bottle, came back with the stone bottle,","Great Expectations"
"and poured his brandy out: no one else taking any. The wretched man","Great Expectations"
"trifled with his glass,—took it up, looked at it through the light, put","Great Expectations"
"it down,—prolonged my misery. All this time Mrs. Joe and Joe were","Great Expectations"
"briskly clearing the table for the pie and pudding.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I couldn’t keep my eyes off him. Always holding tight by the leg of the","Great Expectations"
"table with my hands and feet, I saw the miserable creature finger his","Great Expectations"
"glass playfully, take it up, smile, throw his head back, and drink the","Great Expectations"
"brandy off. Instantly afterwards, the company were seized with","Great Expectations"
"unspeakable consternation, owing to his springing to his feet, turning","Great Expectations"
"round several times in an appalling spasmodic whooping-cough dance, and","Great Expectations"
"rushing out at the door; he then became visible through the window,","Great Expectations"
"violently plunging and expectorating, making the most hideous faces,","Great Expectations"
"and apparently out of his mind.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I held on tight, while Mrs. Joe and Joe ran to him. I didn’t know how I","Great Expectations"
"had done it, but I had no doubt I had murdered him somehow. In my","Great Expectations"
"dreadful situation, it was a relief when he was brought back, and","Great Expectations"
"surveying the company all round as if _they_ had disagreed with him,","Great Expectations"
"sank down into his chair with the one significant gasp, “Tar!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I had filled up the bottle from the tar-water jug. I knew he would be","Great Expectations"
"worse by and by. I moved the table, like a Medium of the present day,","Great Expectations"
"by the vigor of my unseen hold upon it.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Tar!” cried my sister, in amazement. “Why, how ever could Tar come","Great Expectations"
"there?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"But, Uncle Pumblechook, who was omnipotent in that kitchen, wouldn’t","Great Expectations"
"hear the word, wouldn’t hear of the subject, imperiously waved it all","Great Expectations"
"away with his hand, and asked for hot gin and water. My sister, who had","Great Expectations"
"begun to be alarmingly meditative, had to employ herself actively in","Great Expectations"
"getting the gin, the hot water, the sugar, and the lemon-peel, and","Great Expectations"
"mixing them. For the time being at least, I was saved. I still held on","Great Expectations"
"to the leg of the table, but clutched it now with the fervor of","Great Expectations"
"gratitude.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"By degrees, I became calm enough to release my grasp and partake of","Great Expectations"
"pudding. Mr. Pumblechook partook of pudding. All partook of pudding.","Great Expectations"
"The course terminated, and Mr. Pumblechook had begun to beam under the","Great Expectations"
"genial influence of gin and water. I began to think I should get over","Great Expectations"
"the day, when my sister said to Joe, “Clean plates,—cold.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I clutched the leg of the table again immediately, and pressed it to my","Great Expectations"
"bosom as if it had been the companion of my youth and friend of my","Great Expectations"
"soul. I foresaw what was coming, and I felt that this time I really was","Great Expectations"
"gone.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You must taste,” said my sister, addressing the guests with her best","Great Expectations"
"grace—“you must taste, to finish with, such a delightful and delicious","Great Expectations"
"present of Uncle Pumblechook’s!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Must they! Let them not hope to taste it!","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You must know,” said my sister, rising, “it’s a pie; a savory pork","Great Expectations"
"pie.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The company murmured their compliments. Uncle Pumblechook, sensible of","Great Expectations"
"having deserved well of his fellow-creatures, said,—quite vivaciously,","Great Expectations"
"all things considered,—“Well, Mrs. Joe, we’ll do our best endeavours;","Great Expectations"
"let us have a cut at this same pie.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"My sister went out to get it. I heard her steps proceed to the pantry.","Great Expectations"
"I saw Mr. Pumblechook balance his knife. I saw reawakening appetite in","Great Expectations"
"the Roman nostrils of Mr. Wopsle. I heard Mr. Hubble remark that “a bit","Great Expectations"
"of savory pork pie would lay atop of anything you could mention, and do","Great Expectations"
"no harm,” and I heard Joe say, “You shall have some, Pip.” I have never","Great Expectations"
"been absolutely certain whether I uttered a shrill yell of terror,","Great Expectations"
"merely in spirit, or in the bodily hearing of the company. I felt that","Great Expectations"
"I could bear no more, and that I must run away. I released the leg of","Great Expectations"
"the table, and ran for my life.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"But I ran no farther than the house door, for there I ran head-foremost","Great Expectations"
"into a party of soldiers with their muskets, one of whom held out a","Great Expectations"
"pair of handcuffs to me, saying, “Here you are, look sharp, come on!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Chapter V.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The apparition of a file of soldiers ringing down the but-ends of their","Great Expectations"
"loaded muskets on our door-step, caused the dinner-party to rise from","Great Expectations"
"table in confusion, and caused Mrs. Joe re-entering the kitchen","Great Expectations"
"empty-handed, to stop short and stare, in her wondering lament of","Great Expectations"
"“Gracious goodness gracious me, what’s gone—with the—pie!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The sergeant and I were in the kitchen when Mrs. Joe stood staring; at","Great Expectations"
"which crisis I partially recovered the use of my senses. It was the","Great Expectations"
"sergeant who had spoken to me, and he was now looking round at the","Great Expectations"
"company, with his handcuffs invitingly extended towards them in his","Great Expectations"
"right hand, and his left on my shoulder.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Excuse me, ladies and gentleman,” said the sergeant, “but as I have","Great Expectations"
"mentioned at the door to this smart young shaver,” (which he hadn’t),","Great Expectations"
"“I am on a chase in the name of the king, and I want the blacksmith.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And pray what might you want with _him_?” retorted my sister, quick to","Great Expectations"
"resent his being wanted at all.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Missis,” returned the gallant sergeant, “speaking for myself, I should","Great Expectations"
"reply, the honour and pleasure of his fine wife’s acquaintance;","Great Expectations"
"speaking for the king, I answer, a little job done.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"This was received as rather neat in the sergeant; insomuch that Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Pumblechook cried audibly, “Good again!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You see, blacksmith,” said the sergeant, who had by this time picked","Great Expectations"
"out Joe with his eye, “we have had an accident with these, and I find","Great Expectations"
"the lock of one of ’em goes wrong, and the coupling don’t act pretty.","Great Expectations"
"As they are wanted for immediate service, will you throw your eye over","Great Expectations"
"them?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Joe threw his eye over them, and pronounced that the job would","Great Expectations"
"necessitate the lighting of his forge fire, and would take nearer two","Great Expectations"
"hours than one. “Will it? Then will you set about it at once,","Great Expectations"
"blacksmith?” said the off-hand sergeant, “as it’s on his Majesty’s","Great Expectations"
"service. And if my men can bear a hand anywhere, they’ll make","Great Expectations"
"themselves useful.” With that, he called to his men, who came trooping","Great Expectations"
"into the kitchen one after another, and piled their arms in a corner.","Great Expectations"
"And then they stood about, as soldiers do; now, with their hands","Great Expectations"
"loosely clasped before them; now, resting a knee or a shoulder; now,","Great Expectations"
"easing a belt or a pouch; now, opening the door to spit stiffly over","Great Expectations"
"their high stocks, out into the yard.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"All these things I saw without then knowing that I saw them, for I was","Great Expectations"
"in an agony of apprehension. But beginning to perceive that the","Great Expectations"
"handcuffs were not for me, and that the military had so far got the","Great Expectations"
"better of the pie as to put it in the background, I collected a little","Great Expectations"
"more of my scattered wits.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Would you give me the time?” said the sergeant, addressing himself to","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Pumblechook, as to a man whose appreciative powers justified the","Great Expectations"
"inference that he was equal to the time.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It’s just gone half past two.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“That’s not so bad,” said the sergeant, reflecting; “even if I was","Great Expectations"
"forced to halt here nigh two hours, that’ll do. How far might you call","Great Expectations"
"yourselves from the marshes, hereabouts? Not above a mile, I reckon?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Just a mile,” said Mrs. Joe.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“That’ll do. We begin to close in upon ’em about dusk. A little before","Great Expectations"
"dusk, my orders are. That’ll do.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Convicts, sergeant?” asked Mr. Wopsle, in a matter-of-course way.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Ay!” returned the sergeant, “two. They’re pretty well known to be out","Great Expectations"
"on the marshes still, and they won’t try to get clear of ’em before","Great Expectations"
"dusk. Anybody here seen anything of any such game?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Everybody, myself excepted, said no, with confidence. Nobody thought of","Great Expectations"
"me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well!” said the sergeant, “they’ll find themselves trapped in a","Great Expectations"
"circle, I expect, sooner than they count on. Now, blacksmith! If you’re","Great Expectations"
"ready, his Majesty the King is.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Joe had got his coat and waistcoat and cravat off, and his leather","Great Expectations"
"apron on, and passed into the forge. One of the soldiers opened its","Great Expectations"
"wooden windows, another lighted the fire, another turned to at the","Great Expectations"
"bellows, the rest stood round the blaze, which was soon roaring. Then","Great Expectations"
"Joe began to hammer and clink, hammer and clink, and we all looked on.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The interest of the impending pursuit not only absorbed the general","Great Expectations"
"attention, but even made my sister liberal. She drew a pitcher of beer","Great Expectations"
"from the cask for the soldiers, and invited the sergeant to take a","Great Expectations"
"glass of brandy. But Mr. Pumblechook said, sharply, “Give him wine,","Great Expectations"
"Mum. I’ll engage there’s no tar in that:” so, the sergeant thanked him","Great Expectations"
"and said that as he preferred his drink without tar, he would take","Great Expectations"
"wine, if it was equally convenient. When it was given him, he drank his","Great Expectations"
"Majesty’s health and compliments of the season, and took it all at a","Great Expectations"
"mouthful and smacked his lips.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Good stuff, eh, sergeant?” said Mr. Pumblechook.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I’ll tell you something,” returned the sergeant; “I suspect that","Great Expectations"
"stuff’s of _your_ providing.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Pumblechook, with a fat sort of laugh, said, “Ay, ay? Why?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Because,” returned the sergeant, clapping him on the shoulder, “you’re","Great Expectations"
"a man that knows what’s what.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“D’ye think so?” said Mr. Pumblechook, with his former laugh. “Have","Great Expectations"
"another glass!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“With you. Hob and nob,” returned the sergeant. “The top of mine to the","Great Expectations"
"foot of yours,—the foot of yours to the top of mine,—Ring once, ring","Great Expectations"
"twice,—the best tune on the Musical Glasses! Your health. May you live","Great Expectations"
"a thousand years, and never be a worse judge of the right sort than you","Great Expectations"
"are at the present moment of your life!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The sergeant tossed off his glass again and seemed quite ready for","Great Expectations"
"another glass. I noticed that Mr. Pumblechook in his hospitality","Great Expectations"
"appeared to forget that he had made a present of the wine, but took the","Great Expectations"
"bottle from Mrs. Joe and had all the credit of handing it about in a","Great Expectations"
"gush of joviality. Even I got some. And he was so very free of the wine","Great Expectations"
"that he even called for the other bottle, and handed that about with","Great Expectations"
"the same liberality, when the first was gone.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As I watched them while they all stood clustering about the forge,","Great Expectations"
"enjoying themselves so much, I thought what terrible good sauce for a","Great Expectations"
"dinner my fugitive friend on the marshes was. They had not enjoyed","Great Expectations"
"themselves a quarter so much, before the entertainment was brightened","Great Expectations"
"with the excitement he furnished. And now, when they were all in lively","Great Expectations"
"anticipation of “the two villains” being taken, and when the bellows","Great Expectations"
"seemed to roar for the fugitives, the fire to flare for them, the smoke","Great Expectations"
"to hurry away in pursuit of them, Joe to hammer and clink for them, and","Great Expectations"
"all the murky shadows on the wall to shake at them in menace as the","Great Expectations"
"blaze rose and sank, and the red-hot sparks dropped and died, the pale","Great Expectations"
"afternoon outside almost seemed in my pitying young fancy to have","Great Expectations"
"turned pale on their account, poor wretches.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"At last, Joe’s job was done, and the ringing and roaring stopped. As","Great Expectations"
"Joe got on his coat, he mustered courage to propose that some of us","Great Expectations"
"should go down with the soldiers and see what came of the hunt. Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Pumblechook and Mr. Hubble declined, on the plea of a pipe and ladies’","Great Expectations"
"society; but Mr. Wopsle said he would go, if Joe would. Joe said he was","Great Expectations"
"agreeable, and would take me, if Mrs. Joe approved. We never should","Great Expectations"
"have got leave to go, I am sure, but for Mrs. Joe’s curiosity to know","Great Expectations"
"all about it and how it ended. As it was, she merely stipulated, “If","Great Expectations"
"you bring the boy back with his head blown to bits by a musket, don’t","Great Expectations"
"look to me to put it together again.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The sergeant took a polite leave of the ladies, and parted from Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Pumblechook as from a comrade; though I doubt if he were quite as fully","Great Expectations"
"sensible of that gentleman’s merits under arid conditions, as when","Great Expectations"
"something moist was going. His men resumed their muskets and fell in.","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Wopsle, Joe, and I, received strict charge to keep in the rear, and","Great Expectations"
"to speak no word after we reached the marshes. When we were all out in","Great Expectations"
"the raw air and were steadily moving towards our business, I","Great Expectations"
"treasonably whispered to Joe, “I hope, Joe, we shan’t find them.” and","Great Expectations"
"Joe whispered to me, “I’d give a shilling if they had cut and run,","Great Expectations"
"Pip.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We were joined by no stragglers from the village, for the weather was","Great Expectations"
"cold and threatening, the way dreary, the footing bad, darkness coming","Great Expectations"
"on, and the people had good fires in-doors and were keeping the day. A","Great Expectations"
"few faces hurried to glowing windows and looked after us, but none came","Great Expectations"
"out. We passed the finger-post, and held straight on to the churchyard.","Great Expectations"
"There we were stopped a few minutes by a signal from the sergeant’s","Great Expectations"
"hand, while two or three of his men dispersed themselves among the","Great Expectations"
"graves, and also examined the porch. They came in again without finding","Great Expectations"
"anything, and then we struck out on the open marshes, through the gate","Great Expectations"
"at the side of the churchyard. A bitter sleet came rattling against us","Great Expectations"
"here on the east wind, and Joe took me on his back.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Now that we were out upon the dismal wilderness where they little","Great Expectations"
"thought I had been within eight or nine hours and had seen both men","Great Expectations"
"hiding, I considered for the first time, with great dread, if we should","Great Expectations"
"come upon them, would my particular convict suppose that it was I who","Great Expectations"
"had brought the soldiers there? He had asked me if I was a deceiving","Great Expectations"
"imp, and he had said I should be a fierce young hound if I joined the","Great Expectations"
"hunt against him. Would he believe that I was both imp and hound in","Great Expectations"
"treacherous earnest, and had betrayed him?","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was of no use asking myself this question now. There I was, on Joe’s","Great Expectations"
"back, and there was Joe beneath me, charging at the ditches like a","Great Expectations"
"hunter, and stimulating Mr. Wopsle not to tumble on his Roman nose, and","Great Expectations"
"to keep up with us. The soldiers were in front of us, extending into a","Great Expectations"
"pretty wide line with an interval between man and man. We were taking","Great Expectations"
"the course I had begun with, and from which I had diverged in the mist.","Great Expectations"
"Either the mist was not out again yet, or the wind had dispelled it.","Great Expectations"
"Under the low red glare of sunset, the beacon, and the gibbet, and the","Great Expectations"
"mound of the Battery, and the opposite shore of the river, were plain,","Great Expectations"
"though all of a watery lead colour.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"With my heart thumping like a blacksmith at Joe’s broad shoulder, I","Great Expectations"
"looked all about for any sign of the convicts. I could see none, I","Great Expectations"
"could hear none. Mr. Wopsle had greatly alarmed me more than once, by","Great Expectations"
"his blowing and hard breathing; but I knew the sounds by this time, and","Great Expectations"
"could dissociate them from the object of pursuit. I got a dreadful","Great Expectations"
"start, when I thought I heard the file still going; but it was only a","Great Expectations"
"sheep-bell. The sheep stopped in their eating and looked timidly at us;","Great Expectations"
"and the cattle, their heads turned from the wind and sleet, stared","Great Expectations"
"angrily as if they held us responsible for both annoyances; but, except","Great Expectations"
"these things, and the shudder of the dying day in every blade of grass,","Great Expectations"
"there was no break in the bleak stillness of the marshes.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The soldiers were moving on in the direction of the old Battery, and we","Great Expectations"
"were moving on a little way behind them, when, all of a sudden, we all","Great Expectations"
"stopped. For there had reached us on the wings of the wind and rain, a","Great Expectations"
"long shout. It was repeated. It was at a distance towards the east, but","Great Expectations"
"it was long and loud. Nay, there seemed to be two or more shouts raised","Great Expectations"
"together,—if one might judge from a confusion in the sound.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"To this effect the sergeant and the nearest men were speaking under","Great Expectations"
"their breath, when Joe and I came up. After another moment’s listening,","Great Expectations"
"Joe (who was a good judge) agreed, and Mr. Wopsle (who was a bad judge)","Great Expectations"
"agreed. The sergeant, a decisive man, ordered that the sound should not","Great Expectations"
"be answered, but that the course should be changed, and that his men","Great Expectations"
"should make towards it “at the double.” So we slanted to the right","Great Expectations"
"(where the East was), and Joe pounded away so wonderfully, that I had","Great Expectations"
"to hold on tight to keep my seat.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was a run indeed now, and what Joe called, in the only two words he","Great Expectations"
"spoke all the time, “a Winder.” Down banks and up banks, and over","Great Expectations"
"gates, and splashing into dikes, and breaking among coarse rushes: no","Great Expectations"
"man cared where he went. As we came nearer to the shouting, it became","Great Expectations"
"more and more apparent that it was made by more than one voice.","Great Expectations"
"Sometimes, it seemed to stop altogether, and then the soldiers stopped.","Great Expectations"
"When it broke out again, the soldiers made for it at a greater rate","Great Expectations"
"than ever, and we after them. After a while, we had so run it down,","Great Expectations"
"that we could hear one voice calling “Murder!” and another voice,","Great Expectations"
"“Convicts! Runaways! Guard! This way for the runaway convicts!” Then","Great Expectations"
"both voices would seem to be stifled in a struggle, and then would","Great Expectations"
"break out again. And when it had come to this, the soldiers ran like","Great Expectations"
"deer, and Joe too.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The sergeant ran in first, when we had run the noise quite down, and","Great Expectations"
"two of his men ran in close upon him. Their pieces were cocked and","Great Expectations"
"levelled when we all ran in.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Here are both men!” panted the sergeant, struggling at the bottom of a","Great Expectations"
"ditch. “Surrender, you two! and confound you for two wild beasts! Come","Great Expectations"
"asunder!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Water was splashing, and mud was flying, and oaths were being sworn,","Great Expectations"
"and blows were being struck, when some more men went down into the","Great Expectations"
"ditch to help the sergeant, and dragged out, separately, my convict and","Great Expectations"
"the other one. Both were bleeding and panting and execrating and","Great Expectations"
"struggling; but of course I knew them both directly.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Mind!” said my convict, wiping blood from his face with his ragged","Great Expectations"
"sleeves, and shaking torn hair from his fingers: “_I_ took him! _I_","Great Expectations"
"give him up to you! Mind that!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It’s not much to be particular about,” said the sergeant; “it’ll do","Great Expectations"
"you small good, my man, being in the same plight yourself. Handcuffs","Great Expectations"
"there!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I don’t expect it to do me any good. I don’t want it to do me more","Great Expectations"
"good than it does now,” said my convict, with a greedy laugh. “I took","Great Expectations"
"him. He knows it. That’s enough for me.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The other convict was livid to look at, and, in addition to the old","Great Expectations"
"bruised left side of his face, seemed to be bruised and torn all over.","Great Expectations"
"He could not so much as get his breath to speak, until they were both","Great Expectations"
"separately handcuffed, but leaned upon a soldier to keep himself from","Great Expectations"
"falling.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Take notice, guard,—he tried to murder me,” were his first words.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Tried to murder him?” said my convict, disdainfully. “Try, and not do","Great Expectations"
"it? I took him, and giv’ him up; that’s what I done. I not only","Great Expectations"
"prevented him getting off the marshes, but I dragged him here,—dragged","Great Expectations"
"him this far on his way back. He’s a gentleman, if you please, this","Great Expectations"
"villain. Now, the Hulks has got its gentleman again, through me. Murder","Great Expectations"
"him? Worth my while, too, to murder him, when I could do worse and drag","Great Expectations"
"him back!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The other one still gasped, “He tried—he tried-to—murder me. Bear—bear","Great Expectations"
"witness.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Lookee here!” said my convict to the sergeant. “Single-handed I got","Great Expectations"
"clear of the prison-ship; I made a dash and I done it. I could ha’ got","Great Expectations"
"clear of these death-cold flats likewise—look at my leg: you won’t find","Great Expectations"
"much iron on it—if I hadn’t made the discovery that _he_ was here. Let","Great Expectations"
"_him_ go free? Let _him_ profit by the means as I found out? Let _him_","Great Expectations"
"make a tool of me afresh and again? Once more? No, no, no. If I had","Great Expectations"
"died at the bottom there,” and he made an emphatic swing at the ditch","Great Expectations"
"with his manacled hands, “I’d have held to him with that grip, that you","Great Expectations"
"should have been safe to find him in my hold.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The other fugitive, who was evidently in extreme horror of his","Great Expectations"
"companion, repeated, “He tried to murder me. I should have been a dead","Great Expectations"
"man if you had not come up.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“He lies!” said my convict, with fierce energy. “He’s a liar born, and","Great Expectations"
"he’ll die a liar. Look at his face; ain’t it written there? Let him","Great Expectations"
"turn those eyes of his on me. I defy him to do it.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The other, with an effort at a scornful smile, which could not,","Great Expectations"
"however, collect the nervous working of his mouth into any set","Great Expectations"
"expression, looked at the soldiers, and looked about at the marshes and","Great Expectations"
"at the sky, but certainly did not look at the speaker.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Do you see him?” pursued my convict. “Do you see what a villain he is?","Great Expectations"
"Do you see those grovelling and wandering eyes? That’s how he looked","Great Expectations"
"when we were tried together. He never looked at me.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The other, always working and working his dry lips and turning his eyes","Great Expectations"
"restlessly about him far and near, did at last turn them for a moment","Great Expectations"
"on the speaker, with the words, “You are not much to look at,” and with","Great Expectations"
"a half-taunting glance at the bound hands. At that point, my convict","Great Expectations"
"became so frantically exasperated, that he would have rushed upon him","Great Expectations"
"but for the interposition of the soldiers. “Didn’t I tell you,” said","Great Expectations"
"the other convict then, “that he would murder me, if he could?” And any","Great Expectations"
"one could see that he shook with fear, and that there broke out upon","Great Expectations"
"his lips curious white flakes, like thin snow.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Enough of this parley,” said the sergeant. “Light those torches.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As one of the soldiers, who carried a basket in lieu of a gun, went","Great Expectations"
"down on his knee to open it, my convict looked round him for the first","Great Expectations"
"time, and saw me. I had alighted from Joe’s back on the brink of the","Great Expectations"
"ditch when we came up, and had not moved since. I looked at him eagerly","Great Expectations"
"when he looked at me, and slightly moved my hands and shook my head. I","Great Expectations"
"had been waiting for him to see me that I might try to assure him of my","Great Expectations"
"innocence. It was not at all expressed to me that he even comprehended","Great Expectations"
"my intention, for he gave me a look that I did not understand, and it","Great Expectations"
"all passed in a moment. But if he had looked at me for an hour or for a","Great Expectations"
"day, I could not have remembered his face ever afterwards, as having","Great Expectations"
"been more attentive.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The soldier with the basket soon got a light, and lighted three or four","Great Expectations"
"torches, and took one himself and distributed the others. It had been","Great Expectations"
"almost dark before, but now it seemed quite dark, and soon afterwards","Great Expectations"
"very dark. Before we departed from that spot, four soldiers standing in","Great Expectations"
"a ring, fired twice into the air. Presently we saw other torches","Great Expectations"
"kindled at some distance behind us, and others on the marshes on the","Great Expectations"
"opposite bank of the river. “All right,” said the sergeant. “March.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We had not gone far when three cannon were fired ahead of us with a","Great Expectations"
"sound that seemed to burst something inside my ear. “You are expected","Great Expectations"
"on board,” said the sergeant to my convict; “they know you are coming.","Great Expectations"
"Don’t straggle, my man. Close up here.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The two were kept apart, and each walked surrounded by a separate","Great Expectations"
"guard. I had hold of Joe’s hand now, and Joe carried one of the","Great Expectations"
"torches. Mr. Wopsle had been for going back, but Joe was resolved to","Great Expectations"
"see it out, so we went on with the party. There was a reasonably good","Great Expectations"
"path now, mostly on the edge of the river, with a divergence here and","Great Expectations"
"there where a dike came, with a miniature windmill on it and a muddy","Great Expectations"
"sluice-gate. When I looked round, I could see the other lights coming","Great Expectations"
"in after us. The torches we carried dropped great blotches of fire upon","Great Expectations"
"the track, and I could see those, too, lying smoking and flaring. I","Great Expectations"
"could see nothing else but black darkness. Our lights warmed the air","Great Expectations"
"about us with their pitchy blaze, and the two prisoners seemed rather","Great Expectations"
"to like that, as they limped along in the midst of the muskets. We","Great Expectations"
"could not go fast, because of their lameness; and they were so spent,","Great Expectations"
"that two or three times we had to halt while they rested.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"After an hour or so of this travelling, we came to a rough wooden hut","Great Expectations"
"and a landing-place. There was a guard in the hut, and they challenged,","Great Expectations"
"and the sergeant answered. Then, we went into the hut, where there was","Great Expectations"
"a smell of tobacco and whitewash, and a bright fire, and a lamp, and a","Great Expectations"
"stand of muskets, and a drum, and a low wooden bedstead, like an","Great Expectations"
"overgrown mangle without the machinery, capable of holding about a","Great Expectations"
"dozen soldiers all at once. Three or four soldiers who lay upon it in","Great Expectations"
"their great-coats were not much interested in us, but just lifted their","Great Expectations"
"heads and took a sleepy stare, and then lay down again. The sergeant","Great Expectations"
"made some kind of report, and some entry in a book, and then the","Great Expectations"
"convict whom I call the other convict was drafted off with his guard,","Great Expectations"
"to go on board first.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"My convict never looked at me, except that once. While we stood in the","Great Expectations"
"hut, he stood before the fire looking thoughtfully at it, or putting up","Great Expectations"
"his feet by turns upon the hob, and looking thoughtfully at them as if","Great Expectations"
"he pitied them for their recent adventures. Suddenly, he turned to the","Great Expectations"
"sergeant, and remarked,—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I wish to say something respecting this escape. It may prevent some","Great Expectations"
"persons laying under suspicion alonger me.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You can say what you like,” returned the sergeant, standing coolly","Great Expectations"
"looking at him with his arms folded, “but you have no call to say it","Great Expectations"
"here. You’ll have opportunity enough to say about it, and hear about","Great Expectations"
"it, before it’s done with, you know.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I know, but this is another pint, a separate matter. A man can’t","Great Expectations"
"starve; at least _I_ can’t. I took some wittles, up at the willage over","Great Expectations"
"yonder,—where the church stands a’most out on the marshes.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You mean stole,” said the sergeant.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And I’ll tell you where from. From the blacksmith’s.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Halloa!” said the sergeant, staring at Joe.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Halloa, Pip!” said Joe, staring at me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It was some broken wittles—that’s what it was—and a dram of liquor,","Great Expectations"
"and a pie.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Have you happened to miss such an article as a pie, blacksmith?” asked","Great Expectations"
"the sergeant, confidentially.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“My wife did, at the very moment when you came in. Don’t you know,","Great Expectations"
"Pip?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“So,” said my convict, turning his eyes on Joe in a moody manner, and","Great Expectations"
"without the least glance at me,—“so you’re the blacksmith, are you?","Great Expectations"
"Than I’m sorry to say, I’ve eat your pie.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“God knows you’re welcome to it,—so far as it was ever mine,” returned","Great Expectations"
"Joe, with a saving remembrance of Mrs. Joe. “We don’t know what you","Great Expectations"
"have done, but we wouldn’t have you starved to death for it, poor","Great Expectations"
"miserable fellow-creatur.—Would us, Pip?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The something that I had noticed before, clicked in the man’s throat","Great Expectations"
"again, and he turned his back. The boat had returned, and his guard","Great Expectations"
"were ready, so we followed him to the landing-place made of rough","Great Expectations"
"stakes and stones, and saw him put into the boat, which was rowed by a","Great Expectations"
"crew of convicts like himself. No one seemed surprised to see him, or","Great Expectations"
"interested in seeing him, or glad to see him, or sorry to see him, or","Great Expectations"
"spoke a word, except that somebody in the boat growled as if to dogs,","Great Expectations"
"“Give way, you!” which was the signal for the dip of the oars. By the","Great Expectations"
"light of the torches, we saw the black Hulk lying out a little way from","Great Expectations"
"the mud of the shore, like a wicked Noah’s ark. Cribbed and barred and","Great Expectations"
"moored by massive rusty chains, the prison-ship seemed in my young eyes","Great Expectations"
"to be ironed like the prisoners. We saw the boat go alongside, and we","Great Expectations"
"saw him taken up the side and disappear. Then, the ends of the torches","Great Expectations"
"were flung hissing into the water, and went out, as if it were all over","Great Expectations"
"with him.","Great Expectations"

"Chapter VI.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"My state of mind regarding the pilfering from which I had been so","Great Expectations"
"unexpectedly exonerated did not impel me to frank disclosure; but I","Great Expectations"
"hope it had some dregs of good at the bottom of it.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I do not recall that I felt any tenderness of conscience in reference","Great Expectations"
"to Mrs. Joe, when the fear of being found out was lifted off me. But I","Great Expectations"
"loved Joe,—perhaps for no better reason in those early days than","Great Expectations"
"because the dear fellow let me love him,—and, as to him, my inner self","Great Expectations"
"was not so easily composed. It was much upon my mind (particularly when","Great Expectations"
"I first saw him looking about for his file) that I ought to tell Joe","Great Expectations"
"the whole truth. Yet I did not, and for the reason that I mistrusted","Great Expectations"
"that if I did, he would think me worse than I was. The fear of losing","Great Expectations"
"Joe’s confidence, and of thenceforth sitting in the chimney corner at","Great Expectations"
"night staring drearily at my forever lost companion and friend, tied up","Great Expectations"
"my tongue. I morbidly represented to myself that if Joe knew it, I","Great Expectations"
"never afterwards could see him at the fireside feeling his fair","Great Expectations"
"whisker, without thinking that he was meditating on it. That, if Joe","Great Expectations"
"knew it, I never afterwards could see him glance, however casually, at","Great Expectations"
"yesterday’s meat or pudding when it came on to-day’s table, without","Great Expectations"
"thinking that he was debating whether I had been in the pantry. That,","Great Expectations"
"if Joe knew it, and at any subsequent period of our joint domestic life","Great Expectations"
"remarked that his beer was flat or thick, the conviction that he","Great Expectations"
"suspected tar in it, would bring a rush of blood to my face. In a word,","Great Expectations"
"I was too cowardly to do what I knew to be right, as I had been too","Great Expectations"
"cowardly to avoid doing what I knew to be wrong. I had had no","Great Expectations"
"intercourse with the world at that time, and I imitated none of its","Great Expectations"
"many inhabitants who act in this manner. Quite an untaught genius, I","Great Expectations"
"made the discovery of the line of action for myself.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As I was sleepy before we were far away from the prison-ship, Joe took","Great Expectations"
"me on his back again and carried me home. He must have had a tiresome","Great Expectations"
"journey of it, for Mr. Wopsle, being knocked up, was in such a very bad","Great Expectations"
"temper that if the Church had been thrown open, he would probably have","Great Expectations"
"excommunicated the whole expedition, beginning with Joe and myself. In","Great Expectations"
"his lay capacity, he persisted in sitting down in the damp to such an","Great Expectations"
"insane extent, that when his coat was taken off to be dried at the","Great Expectations"
"kitchen fire, the circumstantial evidence on his trousers would have","Great Expectations"
"hanged him, if it had been a capital offence.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"By that time, I was staggering on the kitchen floor like a little","Great Expectations"
"drunkard, through having been newly set upon my feet, and through","Great Expectations"
"having been fast asleep, and through waking in the heat and lights and","Great Expectations"
"noise of tongues. As I came to myself (with the aid of a heavy thump","Great Expectations"
"between the shoulders, and the restorative exclamation “Yah! Was there","Great Expectations"
"ever such a boy as this!” from my sister,) I found Joe telling them","Great Expectations"
"about the convict’s confession, and all the visitors suggesting","Great Expectations"
"different ways by which he had got into the pantry. Mr. Pumblechook","Great Expectations"
"made out, after carefully surveying the premises, that he had first got","Great Expectations"
"upon the roof of the forge, and had then got upon the roof of the","Great Expectations"
"house, and had then let himself down the kitchen chimney by a rope made","Great Expectations"
"of his bedding cut into strips; and as Mr. Pumblechook was very","Great Expectations"
"positive and drove his own chaise-cart—over everybody—it was agreed","Great Expectations"
"that it must be so. Mr. Wopsle, indeed, wildly cried out, “No!” with","Great Expectations"
"the feeble malice of a tired man; but, as he had no theory, and no coat","Great Expectations"
"on, he was unanimously set at naught,—not to mention his smoking hard","Great Expectations"
"behind, as he stood with his back to the kitchen fire to draw the damp","Great Expectations"
"out: which was not calculated to inspire confidence.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"This was all I heard that night before my sister clutched me, as a","Great Expectations"
"slumberous offence to the company’s eyesight, and assisted me up to bed","Great Expectations"
"with such a strong hand that I seemed to have fifty boots on, and to be","Great Expectations"
"dangling them all against the edges of the stairs. My state of mind, as","Great Expectations"
"I have described it, began before I was up in the morning, and lasted","Great Expectations"
"long after the subject had died out, and had ceased to be mentioned","Great Expectations"
"saving on exceptional occasions.","Great Expectations"

"Chapter VII.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"At the time when I stood in the churchyard reading the family","Great Expectations"
"tombstones, I had just enough learning to be able to spell them out. My","Great Expectations"
"construction even of their simple meaning was not very correct, for I","Great Expectations"
"read “wife of the Above” as a complimentary reference to my father’s","Great Expectations"
"exaltation to a better world; and if any one of my deceased relations","Great Expectations"
"had been referred to as “Below,” I have no doubt I should have formed","Great Expectations"
"the worst opinions of that member of the family. Neither were my","Great Expectations"
"notions of the theological positions to which my Catechism bound me, at","Great Expectations"
"all accurate; for, I have a lively remembrance that I supposed my","Great Expectations"
"declaration that I was to “walk in the same all the days of my life,”","Great Expectations"
"laid me under an obligation always to go through the village from our","Great Expectations"
"house in one particular direction, and never to vary it by turning down","Great Expectations"
"by the wheelwright’s or up by the mill.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"When I was old enough, I was to be apprenticed to Joe, and until I","Great Expectations"
"could assume that dignity I was not to be what Mrs. Joe called","Great Expectations"
"“Pompeyed,” or (as I render it) pampered. Therefore, I was not only","Great Expectations"
"odd-boy about the forge, but if any neighbour happened to want an extra","Great Expectations"
"boy to frighten birds, or pick up stones, or do any such job, I was","Great Expectations"
"favoured with the employment. In order, however, that our superior","Great Expectations"
"position might not be compromised thereby, a money-box was kept on the","Great Expectations"
"kitchen mantel-shelf, into which it was publicly made known that all my","Great Expectations"
"earnings were dropped. I have an impression that they were to be","Great Expectations"
"contributed eventually towards the liquidation of the National Debt,","Great Expectations"
"but I know I had no hope of any personal participation in the treasure.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt kept an evening school in the village; that is","Great Expectations"
"to say, she was a ridiculous old woman of limited means and unlimited","Great Expectations"
"infirmity, who used to go to sleep from six to seven every evening, in","Great Expectations"
"the society of youth who paid two pence per week each, for the","Great Expectations"
"improving opportunity of seeing her do it. She rented a small cottage,","Great Expectations"
"and Mr. Wopsle had the room upstairs, where we students used to","Great Expectations"
"overhear him reading aloud in a most dignified and terrific manner, and","Great Expectations"
"occasionally bumping on the ceiling. There was a fiction that Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Wopsle “examined” the scholars once a quarter. What he did on those","Great Expectations"
"occasions was to turn up his cuffs, stick up his hair, and give us Mark","Great Expectations"
"Antony’s oration over the body of Caesar. This was always followed by","Great Expectations"
"Collins’s Ode on the Passions, wherein I particularly venerated Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Wopsle as Revenge throwing his blood-stained sword in thunder down, and","Great Expectations"
"taking the War-denouncing trumpet with a withering look. It was not","Great Expectations"
"with me then, as it was in later life, when I fell into the society of","Great Expectations"
"the Passions, and compared them with Collins and Wopsle, rather to the","Great Expectations"
"disadvantage of both gentlemen.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt, besides keeping this Educational Institution,","Great Expectations"
"kept in the same room—a little general shop. She had no idea what stock","Great Expectations"
"she had, or what the price of anything in it was; but there was a","Great Expectations"
"little greasy memorandum-book kept in a drawer, which served as a","Great Expectations"
"Catalogue of Prices, and by this oracle Biddy arranged all the shop","Great Expectations"
"transactions. Biddy was Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt’s granddaughter; I","Great Expectations"
"confess myself quite unequal to the working out of the problem, what","Great Expectations"
"relation she was to Mr. Wopsle. She was an orphan like myself; like me,","Great Expectations"
"too, had been brought up by hand. She was most noticeable, I thought,","Great Expectations"
"in respect of her extremities; for, her hair always wanted brushing,","Great Expectations"
"her hands always wanted washing, and her shoes always wanted mending","Great Expectations"
"and pulling up at heel. This description must be received with a","Great Expectations"
"week-day limitation. On Sundays, she went to church elaborated.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Much of my unassisted self, and more by the help of Biddy than of Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Wopsle’s great-aunt, I struggled through the alphabet as if it had been","Great Expectations"
"a bramble-bush; getting considerably worried and scratched by every","Great Expectations"
"letter. After that I fell among those thieves, the nine figures, who","Great Expectations"
"seemed every evening to do something new to disguise themselves and","Great Expectations"
"baffle recognition. But, at last I began, in a purblind groping way, to","Great Expectations"
"read, write, and cipher, on the very smallest scale.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"One night I was sitting in the chimney corner with my slate, expending","Great Expectations"
"great efforts on the production of a letter to Joe. I think it must","Great Expectations"
"have been a full year after our hunt upon the marshes, for it was a","Great Expectations"
"long time after, and it was winter and a hard frost. With an alphabet","Great Expectations"
"on the hearth at my feet for reference, I contrived in an hour or two","Great Expectations"
"to print and smear this epistle:—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“MI DEER JO i OPE U R KRWITE WELL i OPE i SHAL SON B HABELL 4 2 TEEDGE","Great Expectations"
"U JO AN THEN WE SHORL B SO GLODD AN WEN i M PRENGTD 2 U JO WOT LARX AN","Great Expectations"
"BLEVE ME INF XN PIP.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"There was no indispensable necessity for my communicating with Joe by","Great Expectations"
"letter, inasmuch as he sat beside me and we were alone. But I delivered","Great Expectations"
"this written communication (slate and all) with my own hand, and Joe","Great Expectations"
"received it as a miracle of erudition.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I say, Pip, old chap!” cried Joe, opening his blue eyes wide, “what a","Great Expectations"
"scholar you are! An’t you?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I should like to be,” said I, glancing at the slate as he held it;","Great Expectations"
"with a misgiving that the writing was rather hilly.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Why, here’s a J,” said Joe, “and a O equal to anythink! Here’s a J and","Great Expectations"
"a O, Pip, and a J-O, Joe.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"[Illustration]","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I had never heard Joe read aloud to any greater extent than this","Great Expectations"
"monosyllable, and I had observed at church last Sunday, when I","Great Expectations"
"accidentally held our Prayer-Book upside down, that it seemed to suit","Great Expectations"
"his convenience quite as well as if it had been all right. Wishing to","Great Expectations"
"embrace the present occasion of finding out whether in teaching Joe, I","Great Expectations"
"should have to begin quite at the beginning, I said, “Ah! But read the","Great Expectations"
"rest, Jo.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“The rest, eh, Pip?” said Joe, looking at it with a slow, searching","Great Expectations"
"eye, “One, two, three. Why, here’s three Js, and three Os, and three","Great Expectations"
"J-O, Joes in it, Pip!”","Great Expectations"

"","Great Expectations"
"“I don’t spell it at all,” said Joe.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“But supposing you did?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It _can’t_ be supposed,” said Joe. “Tho’ I’m uncommon fond of reading,","Great Expectations"
"too.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Are you, Joe?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“On-common. Give me,” said Joe, “a good book, or a good newspaper, and","Great Expectations"
"sit me down afore a good fire, and I ask no better. Lord!” he","Great Expectations"
"continued, after rubbing his knees a little, “when you _do_ come to a J","Great Expectations"
"and a O, and says you, ‘Here, at last, is a J-O, Joe,’ how interesting","Great Expectations"
"reading is!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I derived from this, that Joe’s education, like Steam, was yet in its","Great Expectations"
"infancy. Pursuing the subject, I inquired,—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Didn’t you ever go to school, Joe, when you were as little as me?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No, Pip.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Why didn’t you ever go to school, Joe, when you were as little as me?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well, Pip,” said Joe, taking up the poker, and settling himself to his","Great Expectations"
"usual occupation when he was thoughtful, of slowly raking the fire","Great Expectations"
"between the lower bars; “I’ll tell you. My father, Pip, he were given","Great Expectations"
"to drink, and when he were overtook with drink, he hammered away at my","Great Expectations"
"mother, most onmerciful. It were a’most the only hammering he did,","Great Expectations"
"indeed, ’xcepting at myself. And he hammered at me with a wigor only to","Great Expectations"
"be equalled by the wigor with which he didn’t hammer at his","Great Expectations"
"anwil.—You’re a listening and understanding, Pip?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, Joe.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Consequence, my mother and me we ran away from my father several","Great Expectations"
"times; and then my mother she’d go out to work, and she’d say, “Joe,”","Great Expectations"
"she’d say, “now, please God, you shall have some schooling, child,” and","Great Expectations"
"she’d put me to school. But my father were that good in his hart that","Great Expectations"
"he couldn’t abear to be without us. So, he’d come with a most","Great Expectations"
"tremenjous crowd and make such a row at the doors of the houses where","Great Expectations"
"we was, that they used to be obligated to have no more to do with us","Great Expectations"
"and to give us up to him. And then he took us home and hammered us.","Great Expectations"
"Which, you see, Pip,” said Joe, pausing in his meditative raking of the","Great Expectations"
"fire, and looking at me, “were a drawback on my learning.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Certainly, poor Joe!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Though mind you, Pip,” said Joe, with a judicial touch or two of the","Great Expectations"
"poker on the top bar, “rendering unto all their doo, and maintaining","Great Expectations"
"equal justice betwixt man and man, my father were that good in his","Great Expectations"
"hart, don’t you see?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I didn’t see; but I didn’t say so.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well!” Joe pursued, “somebody must keep the pot a-biling, Pip, or the","Great Expectations"
"pot won’t bile, don’t you know?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I saw that, and said so.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Consequence, my father didn’t make objections to my going to work; so","Great Expectations"
"I went to work at my present calling, which were his too, if he would","Great Expectations"
"have followed it, and I worked tolerable hard, I assure _you_, Pip. In","Great Expectations"
"time I were able to keep him, and I kep him till he went off in a","Great Expectations"
"purple leptic fit. And it were my intentions to have had put upon his","Great Expectations"
"tombstone that, Whatsume’er the failings on his part, Remember reader","Great Expectations"
"he were that good in his heart.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Joe recited this couplet with such manifest pride and careful","Great Expectations"
"perspicuity, that I asked him if he had made it himself.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I made it,” said Joe, “my own self. I made it in a moment. It was like","Great Expectations"
"striking out a horseshoe complete, in a single blow. I never was so","Great Expectations"
"much surprised in all my life,—couldn’t credit my own ed,—to tell you","Great Expectations"
"the truth, hardly believed it _were_ my own ed. As I was saying, Pip,","Great Expectations"
"it were my intentions to have had it cut over him; but poetry costs","Great Expectations"
"money, cut it how you will, small or large, and it were not done. Not","Great Expectations"
"to mention bearers, all the money that could be spared were wanted for","Great Expectations"
"my mother. She were in poor elth, and quite broke. She weren’t long of","Great Expectations"
"following, poor soul, and her share of peace come round at last.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Joe’s blue eyes turned a little watery; he rubbed first one of them,","Great Expectations"
"and then the other, in a most uncongenial and uncomfortable manner,","Great Expectations"
"with the round knob on the top of the poker.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It were but lonesome then,” said Joe, “living here alone, and I got","Great Expectations"
"acquainted with your sister. Now, Pip,”—Joe looked firmly at me as if","Great Expectations"
"he knew I was not going to agree with him;—“your sister is a fine","Great Expectations"
"figure of a woman.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I could not help looking at the fire, in an obvious state of doubt.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Whatever family opinions, or whatever the world’s opinions, on that","Great Expectations"
"subject may be, Pip, your sister is,” Joe tapped the top bar with the","Great Expectations"
"poker after every word following, “a-fine-figure—of—a—woman!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I could think of nothing better to say than “I am glad you think so,","Great Expectations"
"Joe.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“So am I,” returned Joe, catching me up. “_I_ am glad I think so, Pip.","Great Expectations"
"A little redness or a little matter of Bone, here or there, what does","Great Expectations"
"it signify to Me?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I sagaciously observed, if it didn’t signify to him, to whom did it","Great Expectations"
"signify?","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Certainly!” assented Joe. “That’s it. You’re right, old chap! When I","Great Expectations"
"got acquainted with your sister, it were the talk how she was bringing","Great Expectations"
"you up by hand. Very kind of her too, all the folks said, and I said,","Great Expectations"
"along with all the folks. As to you,” Joe pursued with a countenance","Great Expectations"
"expressive of seeing something very nasty indeed, “if you could have","Great Expectations"
"been aware how small and flabby and mean you was, dear me, you’d have","Great Expectations"
"formed the most contemptible opinion of yourself!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Not exactly relishing this, I said, “Never mind me, Joe.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“But I did mind you, Pip,” he returned with tender simplicity. “When I","Great Expectations"
"offered to your sister to keep company, and to be asked in church at","Great Expectations"
"such times as she was willing and ready to come to the forge, I said to","Great Expectations"
"her, ‘And bring the poor little child. God bless the poor little","Great Expectations"
"child,’ I said to your sister, ‘there’s room for _him_ at the forge!’”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I broke out crying and begging pardon, and hugged Joe round the neck:","Great Expectations"
"who dropped the poker to hug me, and to say, “Ever the best of friends;","Great Expectations"
"an’t us, Pip? Don’t cry, old chap!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"When this little interruption was over, Joe resumed:—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well, you see, Pip, and here we are! That’s about where it lights;","Great Expectations"
"here we are! Now, when you take me in hand in my learning, Pip (and I","Great Expectations"
"tell you beforehand I am awful dull, most awful dull), Mrs. Joe mustn’t","Great Expectations"
"see too much of what we’re up to. It must be done, as I may say, on the","Great Expectations"
"sly. And why on the sly? I’ll tell you why, Pip.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He had taken up the poker again; without which, I doubt if he could","Great Expectations"
"have proceeded in his demonstration.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Your sister is given to government.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Given to government, Joe?” I was startled, for I had some shadowy idea","Great Expectations"
"(and I am afraid I must add, hope) that Joe had divorced her in a","Great Expectations"
"favour of the Lords of the Admiralty, or Treasury.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Given to government,” said Joe. “Which I meantersay the government of","Great Expectations"
"you and myself.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Oh!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And she an’t over partial to having scholars on the premises,” Joe","Great Expectations"
"continued, “and in partickler would not be over partial to my being a","Great Expectations"
"scholar, for fear as I might rise. Like a sort of rebel, don’t you","Great Expectations"
"see?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I was going to retort with an inquiry, and had got as far as “Why—”","Great Expectations"
"when Joe stopped me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Stay a bit. I know what you’re a-going to say, Pip; stay a bit! I","Great Expectations"
"don’t deny that your sister comes the Mo-gul over us, now and again. I","Great Expectations"
"don’t deny that she do throw us back-falls, and that she do drop down","Great Expectations"
"upon us heavy. At such times as when your sister is on the Ram-page,","Great Expectations"
"Pip,” Joe sank his voice to a whisper and glanced at the door, “candour","Great Expectations"
"compels fur to admit that she is a Buster.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Joe pronounced this word, as if it began with at least twelve capital","Great Expectations"
"Bs.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Why don’t I rise? That were your observation when I broke it off,","Great Expectations"
"Pip?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, Joe.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well,” said Joe, passing the poker into his left hand, that he might","Great Expectations"
"feel his whisker; and I had no hope of him whenever he took to that","Great Expectations"
"placid occupation; “your sister’s a master-mind. A master-mind.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What’s that?” I asked, in some hope of bringing him to a stand. But","Great Expectations"
"Joe was readier with his definition than I had expected, and completely","Great Expectations"
"stopped me by arguing circularly, and answering with a fixed look,","Great Expectations"
"“Her.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And I ain’t a master-mind,” Joe resumed, when he had unfixed his look,","Great Expectations"
"and got back to his whisker. “And last of all, Pip,—and this I want to","Great Expectations"
"say very serious to you, old chap,—I see so much in my poor mother, of","Great Expectations"
"a woman drudging and slaving and breaking her honest hart and never","Great Expectations"
"getting no peace in her mortal days, that I’m dead afeerd of going","Great Expectations"
"wrong in the way of not doing what’s right by a woman, and I’d fur","Great Expectations"
"rather of the two go wrong the t’other way, and be a little","Great Expectations"
"ill-conwenienced myself. I wish it was only me that got put out, Pip; I","Great Expectations"
"wish there warn’t no Tickler for you, old chap; I wish I could take it","Great Expectations"
"all on myself; but this is the up-and-down-and-straight on it, Pip, and","Great Expectations"
"I hope you’ll overlook shortcomings.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Young as I was, I believe that I dated a new admiration of Joe from","Great Expectations"
"that night. We were equals afterwards, as we had been before; but,","Great Expectations"
"afterwards at quiet times when I sat looking at Joe and thinking about","Great Expectations"
"him, I had a new sensation of feeling conscious that I was looking up","Great Expectations"
"to Joe in my heart.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“However,” said Joe, rising to replenish the fire; “here’s the","Great Expectations"
"Dutch-clock a-working himself up to being equal to strike Eight of ’em,","Great Expectations"
"and she’s not come home yet! I hope Uncle Pumblechook’s mare mayn’t","Great Expectations"
"have set a forefoot on a piece o’ ice, and gone down.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mrs. Joe made occasional trips with Uncle Pumblechook on market-days,","Great Expectations"
"to assist him in buying such household stuffs and goods as required a","Great Expectations"
"woman’s judgment; Uncle Pumblechook being a bachelor and reposing no","Great Expectations"
"confidences in his domestic servant. This was market-day, and Mrs. Joe","Great Expectations"
"was out on one of these expeditions.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Joe made the fire and swept the hearth, and then we went to the door to","Great Expectations"
"listen for the chaise-cart. It was a dry cold night, and the wind blew","Great Expectations"
"keenly, and the frost was white and hard. A man would die to-night of","Great Expectations"
"lying out on the marshes, I thought. And then I looked at the stars,","Great Expectations"
"and considered how awful it would be for a man to turn his face up to","Great Expectations"
"them as he froze to death, and see no help or pity in all the","Great Expectations"
"glittering multitude.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Here comes the mare,” said Joe, “ringing like a peal of bells!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The sound of her iron shoes upon the hard road was quite musical, as","Great Expectations"
"she came along at a much brisker trot than usual. We got a chair out,","Great Expectations"
"ready for Mrs. Joe’s alighting, and stirred up the fire that they might","Great Expectations"
"see a bright window, and took a final survey of the kitchen that","Great Expectations"
"nothing might be out of its place. When we had completed these","Great Expectations"
"preparations, they drove up, wrapped to the eyes. Mrs. Joe was soon","Great Expectations"
"landed, and Uncle Pumblechook was soon down too, covering the mare with","Great Expectations"
"a cloth, and we were soon all in the kitchen, carrying so much cold air","Great Expectations"
"in with us that it seemed to drive all the heat out of the fire.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Now,” said Mrs. Joe, unwrapping herself with haste and excitement, and","Great Expectations"
"throwing her bonnet back on her shoulders where it hung by the strings,","Great Expectations"
"“if this boy ain’t grateful this night, he never will be!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I looked as grateful as any boy possibly could, who was wholly","Great Expectations"
"uninformed why he ought to assume that expression.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It’s only to be hoped,” said my sister, “that he won’t be Pompeyed.","Great Expectations"
"But I have my fears.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“She ain’t in that line, Mum,” said Mr. Pumblechook. “She knows","Great Expectations"
"better.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"She? I looked at Joe, making the motion with my lips and eyebrows,","Great Expectations"
"“She?” Joe looked at me, making the motion with _his_ lips and","Great Expectations"
"eyebrows, “She?” My sister catching him in the act, he drew the back of","Great Expectations"
"his hand across his nose with his usual conciliatory air on such","Great Expectations"
"occasions, and looked at her.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well?” said my sister, in her snappish way. “What are you staring at?","Great Expectations"
"Is the house afire?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“—Which some individual,” Joe politely hinted, “mentioned—she.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And she is a she, I suppose?” said my sister. “Unless you call Miss","Great Expectations"
"Havisham a he. And I doubt if even you’ll go so far as that.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Miss Havisham, up town?” said Joe.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Is there any Miss Havisham down town?” returned my sister.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“She wants this boy to go and play there. And of course he’s going. And","Great Expectations"
"he had better play there,” said my sister, shaking her head at me as an","Great Expectations"
"encouragement to be extremely light and sportive, “or I’ll work him.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I had heard of Miss Havisham up town,—everybody for miles round had","Great Expectations"
"heard of Miss Havisham up town,—as an immensely rich and grim lady who","Great Expectations"
"lived in a large and dismal house barricaded against robbers, and who","Great Expectations"
"led a life of seclusion.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well to be sure!” said Joe, astounded. “I wonder how she come to know","Great Expectations"
"Pip!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Noodle!” cried my sister. “Who said she knew him?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“—Which some individual,” Joe again politely hinted, “mentioned that","Great Expectations"
"she wanted him to go and play there.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And couldn’t she ask Uncle Pumblechook if he knew of a boy to go and","Great Expectations"
"play there? Isn’t it just barely possible that Uncle Pumblechook may be","Great Expectations"
"a tenant of hers, and that he may sometimes—we won’t say quarterly or","Great Expectations"
"half-yearly, for that would be requiring too much of you—but","Great Expectations"
"sometimes—go there to pay his rent? And couldn’t she then ask Uncle","Great Expectations"
"Pumblechook if he knew of a boy to go and play there? And couldn’t","Great Expectations"
"Uncle Pumblechook, being always considerate and thoughtful for","Great Expectations"
"us—though you may not think it, Joseph,” in a tone of the deepest","Great Expectations"
"reproach, as if he were the most callous of nephews, “then mention this","Great Expectations"
"boy, standing Prancing here”—which I solemnly declare I was not","Great Expectations"
"doing—“that I have for ever been a willing slave to?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Good again!” cried Uncle Pumblechook. “Well put! Prettily pointed!","Great Expectations"
"Good indeed! Now Joseph, you know the case.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No, Joseph,” said my sister, still in a reproachful manner, while Joe","Great Expectations"
"apologetically drew the back of his hand across and across his nose,","Great Expectations"
"“you do not yet—though you may not think it—know the case. You may","Great Expectations"
"consider that you do, but you do _not_, Joseph. For you do not know","Great Expectations"
"that Uncle Pumblechook, being sensible that for anything we can tell,","Great Expectations"
"this boy’s fortune may be made by his going to Miss Havisham’s, has","Great Expectations"
"offered to take him into town to-night in his own chaise-cart, and to","Great Expectations"
"keep him to-night, and to take him with his own hands to Miss","Great Expectations"
"Havisham’s to-morrow morning. And Lor-a-mussy me!” cried my sister,","Great Expectations"
"casting off her bonnet in sudden desperation, “here I stand talking to","Great Expectations"
"mere Mooncalfs, with Uncle Pumblechook waiting, and the mare catching","Great Expectations"
"cold at the door, and the boy grimed with crock and dirt from the hair","Great Expectations"
"of his head to the sole of his foot!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"With that, she pounced upon me, like an eagle on a lamb, and my face","Great Expectations"
"was squeezed into wooden bowls in sinks, and my head was put under taps","Great Expectations"
"of water-butts, and I was soaped, and kneaded, and towelled, and","Great Expectations"
"thumped, and harrowed, and rasped, until I really was quite beside","Great Expectations"
"myself. (I may here remark that I suppose myself to be better","Great Expectations"
"acquainted than any living authority, with the ridgy effect of a","Great Expectations"
"wedding-ring, passing unsympathetically over the human countenance.)","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"When my ablutions were completed, I was put into clean linen of the","Great Expectations"
"stiffest character, like a young penitent into sackcloth, and was","Great Expectations"
"trussed up in my tightest and fearfullest suit. I was then delivered","Great Expectations"
"over to Mr. Pumblechook, who formally received me as if he were the","Great Expectations"
"Sheriff, and who let off upon me the speech that I knew he had been","Great Expectations"
"dying to make all along: “Boy, be forever grateful to all friends, but","Great Expectations"
"especially unto them which brought you up by hand!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Good-bye, Joe!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“God bless you, Pip, old chap!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I had never parted from him before, and what with my feelings and what","Great Expectations"
"with soapsuds, I could at first see no stars from the chaise-cart. But","Great Expectations"
"they twinkled out one by one, without throwing any light on the","Great Expectations"
"questions why on earth I was going to play at Miss Havisham’s, and what","Great Expectations"
"on earth I was expected to play at.","Great Expectations"

"Chapter VIII.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Pumblechook’s premises in the High Street of the market town, were","Great Expectations"
"of a peppercorny and farinaceous character, as the premises of a","Great Expectations"
"cornchandler and seedsman should be. It appeared to me that he must be","Great Expectations"
"a very happy man indeed, to have so many little drawers in his shop;","Great Expectations"
"and I wondered when I peeped into one or two on the lower tiers, and","Great Expectations"
"saw the tied-up brown paper packets inside, whether the flower-seeds","Great Expectations"
"and bulbs ever wanted of a fine day to break out of those jails, and","Great Expectations"
"bloom.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was in the early morning after my arrival that I entertained this","Great Expectations"
"speculation. On the previous night, I had been sent straight to bed in","Great Expectations"
"an attic with a sloping roof, which was so low in the corner where the","Great Expectations"
"bedstead was, that I calculated the tiles as being within a foot of my","Great Expectations"
"eyebrows. In the same early morning, I discovered a singular affinity","Great Expectations"
"between seeds and corduroys. Mr. Pumblechook wore corduroys, and so did","Great Expectations"
"his shopman; and somehow, there was a general air and flavour about the","Great Expectations"
"corduroys, so much in the nature of seeds, and a general air and","Great Expectations"
"flavour about the seeds, so much in the nature of corduroys, that I","Great Expectations"
"hardly knew which was which. The same opportunity served me for","Great Expectations"
"noticing that Mr. Pumblechook appeared to conduct his business by","Great Expectations"
"looking across the street at the saddler, who appeared to transact","Great Expectations"
"_his_ business by keeping his eye on the coachmaker, who appeared to","Great Expectations"
"get on in life by putting his hands in his pockets and contemplating","Great Expectations"
"the baker, who in his turn folded his arms and stared at the grocer,","Great Expectations"
"who stood at his door and yawned at the chemist. The watchmaker, always","Great Expectations"
"poring over a little desk with a magnifying-glass at his eye, and","Great Expectations"
"always inspected by a group of smock-frocks poring over him through the","Great Expectations"
"glass of his shop-window, seemed to be about the only person in the","Great Expectations"
"High Street whose trade engaged his attention.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Pumblechook and I breakfasted at eight o’clock in the parlour","Great Expectations"
"behind the shop, while the shopman took his mug of tea and hunch of","Great Expectations"
"bread and butter on a sack of peas in the front premises. I considered","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Pumblechook wretched company. Besides being possessed by my","Great Expectations"
"sister’s idea that a mortifying and penitential character ought to be","Great Expectations"
"imparted to my diet,—besides giving me as much crumb as possible in","Great Expectations"
"combination with as little butter, and putting such a quantity of warm","Great Expectations"
"water into my milk that it would have been more candid to have left the","Great Expectations"
"milk out altogether,—his conversation consisted of nothing but","Great Expectations"
"arithmetic. On my politely bidding him Good-morning, he said,","Great Expectations"
"pompously, “Seven times nine, boy?” And how should _I_ be able to","Great Expectations"
"answer, dodged in that way, in a strange place, on an empty stomach! I","Great Expectations"
"was hungry, but before I had swallowed a morsel, he began a running sum","Great Expectations"
"that lasted all through the breakfast. “Seven?” “And four?” “And","Great Expectations"
"eight?” “And six?” “And two?” “And ten?” And so on. And after each","Great Expectations"
"figure was disposed of, it was as much as I could do to get a bite or a","Great Expectations"
"sup, before the next came; while he sat at his ease guessing nothing,","Great Expectations"
"and eating bacon and hot roll, in (if I may be allowed the expression)","Great Expectations"
"a gorging and gormandizing manner.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"For such reasons, I was very glad when ten o’clock came and we started","Great Expectations"
"for Miss Havisham’s; though I was not at all at my ease regarding the","Great Expectations"
"manner in which I should acquit myself under that lady’s roof. Within a","Great Expectations"
"quarter of an hour we came to Miss Havisham’s house, which was of old","Great Expectations"
"brick, and dismal, and had a great many iron bars to it. Some of the","Great Expectations"
"windows had been walled up; of those that remained, all the lower were","Great Expectations"
"rustily barred. There was a courtyard in front, and that was barred; so","Great Expectations"
"we had to wait, after ringing the bell, until some one should come to","Great Expectations"
"open it. While we waited at the gate, I peeped in (even then Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Pumblechook said, “And fourteen?” but I pretended not to hear him), and","Great Expectations"
"saw that at the side of the house there was a large brewery. No brewing","Great Expectations"
"was going on in it, and none seemed to have gone on for a long long","Great Expectations"
"time.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"A window was raised, and a clear voice demanded “What name?” To which","Great Expectations"
"my conductor replied, “Pumblechook.” The voice returned, “Quite right,”","Great Expectations"
"and the window was shut again, and a young lady came across the","Great Expectations"
"court-yard, with keys in her hand.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“This,” said Mr. Pumblechook, “is Pip.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“This is Pip, is it?” returned the young lady, who was very pretty and","Great Expectations"
"seemed very proud; “come in, Pip.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Pumblechook was coming in also, when she stopped him with the gate.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Oh!” she said. “Did you wish to see Miss Havisham?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“If Miss Havisham wished to see me,” returned Mr. Pumblechook,","Great Expectations"
"discomfited.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Ah!” said the girl; “but you see she don’t.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"She said it so finally, and in such an undiscussible way, that Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Pumblechook, though in a condition of ruffled dignity, could not","Great Expectations"
"protest. But he eyed me severely,—as if _I_ had done anything to","Great Expectations"
"him!—and departed with the words reproachfully delivered: “Boy! Let","Great Expectations"
"your behaviour here be a credit unto them which brought you up by","Great Expectations"
"hand!” I was not free from apprehension that he would come back to","Great Expectations"
"propound through the gate, “And sixteen?” But he didn’t.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"My young conductress locked the gate, and we went across the courtyard.","Great Expectations"
"It was paved and clean, but grass was growing in every crevice. The","Great Expectations"
"brewery buildings had a little lane of communication with it, and the","Great Expectations"
"wooden gates of that lane stood open, and all the brewery beyond stood","Great Expectations"
"open, away to the high enclosing wall; and all was empty and disused.","Great Expectations"
"The cold wind seemed to blow colder there than outside the gate; and it","Great Expectations"
"made a shrill noise in howling in and out at the open sides of the","Great Expectations"
"brewery, like the noise of wind in the rigging of a ship at sea.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"She saw me looking at it, and she said, “You could drink without hurt","Great Expectations"
"all the strong beer that’s brewed there now, boy.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I should think I could, miss,” said I, in a shy way.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Better not try to brew beer there now, or it would turn out sour, boy;","Great Expectations"
"don’t you think so?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It looks like it, miss.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Not that anybody means to try,” she added, “for that’s all done with,","Great Expectations"
"and the place will stand as idle as it is till it falls. As to strong","Great Expectations"
"beer, there’s enough of it in the cellars already, to drown the Manor","Great Expectations"
"House.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"[Illustration]","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Is that the name of this house, miss?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“One of its names, boy.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It has more than one, then, miss?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“One more. Its other name was Satis; which is Greek, or Latin, or","Great Expectations"
"Hebrew, or all three—or all one to me—for enough.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Enough House,” said I; “that’s a curious name, miss.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes,” she replied; “but it meant more than it said. It meant, when it","Great Expectations"
"was given, that whoever had this house could want nothing else. They","Great Expectations"
"must have been easily satisfied in those days, I should think. But","Great Expectations"
"don’t loiter, boy.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Though she called me “boy” so often, and with a carelessness that was","Great Expectations"
"far from complimentary, she was of about my own age. She seemed much","Great Expectations"
"older than I, of course, being a girl, and beautiful and","Great Expectations"
"self-possessed; and she was as scornful of me as if she had been","Great Expectations"
"one-and-twenty, and a queen.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We went into the house by a side door, the great front entrance had two","Great Expectations"
"chains across it outside,—and the first thing I noticed was, that the","Great Expectations"
"passages were all dark, and that she had left a candle burning there.","Great Expectations"
"She took it up, and we went through more passages and up a staircase,","Great Expectations"
"and still it was all dark, and only the candle lighted us.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"At last we came to the door of a room, and she said, “Go in.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I answered, more in shyness than politeness, “After you, miss.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"To this she returned: “Don’t be ridiculous, boy; I am not going in.”","Great Expectations"
"And scornfully walked away, and—what was worse—took the candle with","Great Expectations"
"her.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"This was very uncomfortable, and I was half afraid. However, the only","Great Expectations"
"thing to be done being to knock at the door, I knocked, and was told","Great Expectations"
"from within to enter. I entered, therefore, and found myself in a","Great Expectations"
"pretty large room, well lighted with wax candles. No glimpse of","Great Expectations"
"daylight was to be seen in it. It was a dressing-room, as I supposed","Great Expectations"
"from the furniture, though much of it was of forms and uses then quite","Great Expectations"
"unknown to me. But prominent in it was a draped table with a gilded","Great Expectations"
"looking-glass, and that I made out at first sight to be a fine lady’s","Great Expectations"
"dressing-table.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Whether I should have made out this object so soon if there had been no","Great Expectations"
"fine lady sitting at it, I cannot say. In an arm-chair, with an elbow","Great Expectations"
"resting on the table and her head leaning on that hand, sat the","Great Expectations"
"strangest lady I have ever seen, or shall ever see.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"She was dressed in rich materials,—satins, and lace, and silks,—all of","Great Expectations"
"white. Her shoes were white. And she had a long white veil dependent","Great Expectations"
"from her hair, and she had bridal flowers in her hair, but her hair was","Great Expectations"
"white. Some bright jewels sparkled on her neck and on her hands, and","Great Expectations"
"some other jewels lay sparkling on the table. Dresses, less splendid","Great Expectations"
"than the dress she wore, and half-packed trunks, were scattered about.","Great Expectations"
"She had not quite finished dressing, for she had but one shoe on,—the","Great Expectations"
"other was on the table near her hand,—her veil was but half arranged,","Great Expectations"
"her watch and chain were not put on, and some lace for her bosom lay","Great Expectations"
"with those trinkets, and with her handkerchief, and gloves, and some","Great Expectations"
"flowers, and a Prayer-Book all confusedly heaped about the","Great Expectations"
"looking-glass.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was not in the first few moments that I saw all these things, though","Great Expectations"
"I saw more of them in the first moments than might be supposed. But I","Great Expectations"
"saw that everything within my view which ought to be white, had been","Great Expectations"
"white long ago, and had lost its lustre and was faded and yellow. I saw","Great Expectations"
"that the bride within the bridal dress had withered like the dress, and","Great Expectations"
"like the flowers, and had no brightness left but the brightness of her","Great Expectations"
"sunken eyes. I saw that the dress had been put upon the rounded figure","Great Expectations"
"of a young woman, and that the figure upon which it now hung loose had","Great Expectations"
"shrunk to skin and bone. Once, I had been taken to see some ghastly","Great Expectations"
"waxwork at the Fair, representing I know not what impossible personage","Great Expectations"
"lying in state. Once, I had been taken to one of our old marsh churches","Great Expectations"
"to see a skeleton in the ashes of a rich dress that had been dug out of","Great Expectations"
"a vault under the church pavement. Now, waxwork and skeleton seemed to","Great Expectations"
"have dark eyes that moved and looked at me. I should have cried out, if","Great Expectations"
"I could.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Who is it?” said the lady at the table.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Pip, ma’am.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Pip?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Mr. Pumblechook’s boy, ma’am. Come—to play.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Come nearer; let me look at you. Come close.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was when I stood before her, avoiding her eyes, that I took note of","Great Expectations"
"the surrounding objects in detail, and saw that her watch had stopped","Great Expectations"
"at twenty minutes to nine, and that a clock in the room had stopped at","Great Expectations"
"twenty minutes to nine.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Look at me,” said Miss Havisham. “You are not afraid of a woman who","Great Expectations"
"has never seen the sun since you were born?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I regret to state that I was not afraid of telling the enormous lie","Great Expectations"
"comprehended in the answer “No.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Do you know what I touch here?” she said, laying her hands, one upon","Great Expectations"
"the other, on her left side.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, ma’am.” (It made me think of the young man.)","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What do I touch?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Your heart.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Broken!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"She uttered the word with an eager look, and with strong emphasis, and","Great Expectations"
"with a weird smile that had a kind of boast in it. Afterwards she kept","Great Expectations"
"her hands there for a little while, and slowly took them away as if","Great Expectations"
"they were heavy.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I am tired,” said Miss Havisham. “I want diversion, and I have done","Great Expectations"
"with men and women. Play.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I think it will be conceded by my most disputatious reader, that she","Great Expectations"
"could hardly have directed an unfortunate boy to do anything in the","Great Expectations"
"wide world more difficult to be done under the circumstances.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I sometimes have sick fancies,” she went on, “and I have a sick fancy","Great Expectations"
"that I want to see some play. There, there!” with an impatient movement","Great Expectations"
"of the fingers of her right hand; “play, play, play!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"For a moment, with the fear of my sister’s working me before my eyes, I","Great Expectations"
"had a desperate idea of starting round the room in the assumed","Great Expectations"
"character of Mr. Pumblechook’s chaise-cart. But I felt myself so","Great Expectations"
"unequal to the performance that I gave it up, and stood looking at Miss","Great Expectations"
"Havisham in what I suppose she took for a dogged manner, inasmuch as","Great Expectations"
"she said, when we had taken a good look at each other,—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Are you sullen and obstinate?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No, ma’am, I am very sorry for you, and very sorry I can’t play just","Great Expectations"
"now. If you complain of me I shall get into trouble with my sister, so","Great Expectations"
"I would do it if I could; but it’s so new here, and so strange, and so","Great Expectations"
"fine,—and melancholy—.” I stopped, fearing I might say too much, or had","Great Expectations"
"already said it, and we took another look at each other.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Before she spoke again, she turned her eyes from me, and looked at the","Great Expectations"
"dress she wore, and at the dressing-table, and finally at herself in","Great Expectations"
"the looking-glass.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“So new to him,” she muttered, “so old to me; so strange to him, so","Great Expectations"
"familiar to me; so melancholy to both of us! Call Estella.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As she was still looking at the reflection of herself, I thought she","Great Expectations"
"was still talking to herself, and kept quiet.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Call Estella,” she repeated, flashing a look at me. “You can do that.","Great Expectations"
"Call Estella. At the door.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"To stand in the dark in a mysterious passage of an unknown house,","Great Expectations"
"bawling Estella to a scornful young lady neither visible nor","Great Expectations"
"responsive, and feeling it a dreadful liberty so to roar out her name,","Great Expectations"
"was almost as bad as playing to order. But she answered at last, and","Great Expectations"
"her light came along the dark passage like a star.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Miss Havisham beckoned her to come close, and took up a jewel from the","Great Expectations"
"table, and tried its effect upon her fair young bosom and against her","Great Expectations"
"pretty brown hair. “Your own, one day, my dear, and you will use it","Great Expectations"
"well. Let me see you play cards with this boy.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“With this boy? Why, he is a common labouring-boy!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I thought I overheard Miss Havisham answer,—only it seemed so","Great Expectations"
"unlikely,—“Well? You can break his heart.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What do you play, boy?” asked Estella of myself, with the greatest","Great Expectations"
"disdain.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Nothing but beggar my neighbour, miss.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Beggar him,” said Miss Havisham to Estella. So we sat down to cards.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was then I began to understand that everything in the room had","Great Expectations"
"stopped, like the watch and the clock, a long time ago. I noticed that","Great Expectations"
"Miss Havisham put down the jewel exactly on the spot from which she had","Great Expectations"
"taken it up. As Estella dealt the cards, I glanced at the","Great Expectations"
"dressing-table again, and saw that the shoe upon it, once white, now","Great Expectations"
"yellow, had never been worn. I glanced down at the foot from which the","Great Expectations"
"shoe was absent, and saw that the silk stocking on it, once white, now","Great Expectations"
"yellow, had been trodden ragged. Without this arrest of everything,","Great Expectations"
"this standing still of all the pale decayed objects, not even the","Great Expectations"
"withered bridal dress on the collapsed form could have looked so like","Great Expectations"
"grave-clothes, or the long veil so like a shroud.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"So she sat, corpse-like, as we played at cards; the frillings and","Great Expectations"
"trimmings on her bridal dress, looking like earthy paper. I knew","Great Expectations"
"nothing then of the discoveries that are occasionally made of bodies","Great Expectations"
"buried in ancient times, which fall to powder in the moment of being","Great Expectations"
"distinctly seen; but, I have often thought since, that she must have","Great Expectations"
"looked as if the admission of the natural light of day would have","Great Expectations"
"struck her to dust.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“He calls the knaves Jacks, this boy!” said Estella with disdain,","Great Expectations"
"before our first game was out. “And what coarse hands he has! And what","Great Expectations"
"thick boots!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I had never thought of being ashamed of my hands before; but I began to","Great Expectations"
"consider them a very indifferent pair. Her contempt for me was so","Great Expectations"
"strong, that it became infectious, and I caught it.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"She won the game, and I dealt. I misdealt, as was only natural, when I","Great Expectations"
"knew she was lying in wait for me to do wrong; and she denounced me for","Great Expectations"
"a stupid, clumsy labouring-boy.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You say nothing of her,” remarked Miss Havisham to me, as she looked","Great Expectations"
"on. “She says many hard things of you, but you say nothing of her. What","Great Expectations"
"do you think of her?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I don’t like to say,” I stammered.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Tell me in my ear,” said Miss Havisham, bending down.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I think she is very proud,” I replied, in a whisper.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Anything else?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I think she is very pretty.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Anything else?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I think she is very insulting.” (She was looking at me then with a","Great Expectations"
"look of supreme aversion.)","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Anything else?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I think I should like to go home.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And never see her again, though she is so pretty?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I am not sure that I shouldn’t like to see her again, but I should","Great Expectations"
"like to go home now.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You shall go soon,” said Miss Havisham, aloud. “Play the game out.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Saving for the one weird smile at first, I should have felt almost sure","Great Expectations"
"that Miss Havisham’s face could not smile. It had dropped into a","Great Expectations"
"watchful and brooding expression,—most likely when all the things about","Great Expectations"
"her had become transfixed,—and it looked as if nothing could ever lift","Great Expectations"
"it up again. Her chest had dropped, so that she stooped; and her voice","Great Expectations"
"had dropped, so that she spoke low, and with a dead lull upon her;","Great Expectations"
"altogether, she had the appearance of having dropped body and soul,","Great Expectations"
"within and without, under the weight of a crushing blow.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I played the game to an end with Estella, and she beggared me. She","Great Expectations"
"threw the cards down on the table when she had won them all, as if she","Great Expectations"
"despised them for having been won of me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“When shall I have you here again?” said Miss Havisham. “Let me think.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I was beginning to remind her that to-day was Wednesday, when she","Great Expectations"
"checked me with her former impatient movement of the fingers of her","Great Expectations"
"right hand.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“There, there! I know nothing of days of the week; I know nothing of","Great Expectations"
"weeks of the year. Come again after six days. You hear?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, ma’am.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Estella, take him down. Let him have something to eat, and let him","Great Expectations"
"roam and look about him while he eats. Go, Pip.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I followed the candle down, as I had followed the candle up, and she","Great Expectations"
"stood it in the place where we had found it. Until she opened the side","Great Expectations"
"entrance, I had fancied, without thinking about it, that it must","Great Expectations"
"necessarily be night-time. The rush of the daylight quite confounded","Great Expectations"
"me, and made me feel as if I had been in the candlelight of the strange","Great Expectations"
"room many hours.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You are to wait here, you boy,” said Estella; and disappeared and","Great Expectations"
"closed the door.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I took the opportunity of being alone in the courtyard to look at my","Great Expectations"
"coarse hands and my common boots. My opinion of those accessories was","Great Expectations"
"not favourable. They had never troubled me before, but they troubled me","Great Expectations"
"now, as vulgar appendages. I determined to ask Joe why he had ever","Great Expectations"
"taught me to call those picture-cards Jacks, which ought to be called","Great Expectations"
"knaves. I wished Joe had been rather more genteelly brought up, and","Great Expectations"
"then I should have been so too.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"She came back, with some bread and meat and a little mug of beer. She","Great Expectations"
"put the mug down on the stones of the yard, and gave me the bread and","Great Expectations"
"meat without looking at me, as insolently as if I were a dog in","Great Expectations"
"disgrace. I was so humiliated, hurt, spurned, offended, angry, sorry,—I","Great Expectations"
"cannot hit upon the right name for the smart—God knows what its name","Great Expectations"
"was,—that tears started to my eyes. The moment they sprang there, the","Great Expectations"
"girl looked at me with a quick delight in having been the cause of","Great Expectations"
"them. This gave me power to keep them back and to look at her: so, she","Great Expectations"
"gave a contemptuous toss—but with a sense, I thought, of having made","Great Expectations"
"too sure that I was so wounded—and left me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"But when she was gone, I looked about me for a place to hide my face","Great Expectations"
"in, and got behind one of the gates in the brewery-lane, and leaned my","Great Expectations"
"sleeve against the wall there, and leaned my forehead on it and cried.","Great Expectations"
"As I cried, I kicked the wall, and took a hard twist at my hair; so","Great Expectations"
"bitter were my feelings, and so sharp was the smart without a name,","Great Expectations"
"that needed counteraction.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"My sister’s bringing up had made me sensitive. In the little world in","Great Expectations"
"which children have their existence whosoever brings them up, there is","Great Expectations"
"nothing so finely perceived and so finely felt as injustice. It may be","Great Expectations"
"only small injustice that the child can be exposed to; but the child is","Great Expectations"
"small, and its world is small, and its rocking-horse stands as many","Great Expectations"
"hands high, according to scale, as a big-boned Irish hunter. Within","Great Expectations"
"myself, I had sustained, from my babyhood, a perpetual conflict with","Great Expectations"
"injustice. I had known, from the time when I could speak, that my","Great Expectations"
"sister, in her capricious and violent coercion, was unjust to me. I had","Great Expectations"
"cherished a profound conviction that her bringing me up by hand gave","Great Expectations"
"her no right to bring me up by jerks. Through all my punishments,","Great Expectations"
"disgraces, fasts, and vigils, and other penitential performances, I had","Great Expectations"
"nursed this assurance; and to my communing so much with it, in a","Great Expectations"
"solitary and unprotected way, I in great part refer the fact that I was","Great Expectations"
"morally timid and very sensitive.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I got rid of my injured feelings for the time by kicking them into the","Great Expectations"
"brewery wall, and twisting them out of my hair, and then I smoothed my","Great Expectations"
"face with my sleeve, and came from behind the gate. The bread and meat","Great Expectations"
"were acceptable, and the beer was warming and tingling, and I was soon","Great Expectations"
"in spirits to look about me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"To be sure, it was a deserted place, down to the pigeon-house in the","Great Expectations"
"brewery-yard, which had been blown crooked on its pole by some high","Great Expectations"
"wind, and would have made the pigeons think themselves at sea, if there","Great Expectations"
"had been any pigeons there to be rocked by it. But there were no","Great Expectations"
"pigeons in the dove-cot, no horses in the stable, no pigs in the sty,","Great Expectations"
"no malt in the storehouse, no smells of grains and beer in the copper","Great Expectations"
"or the vat. All the uses and scents of the brewery might have","Great Expectations"
"evaporated with its last reek of smoke. In a by-yard, there was a","Great Expectations"
"wilderness of empty casks, which had a certain sour remembrance of","Great Expectations"
"better days lingering about them; but it was too sour to be accepted as","Great Expectations"
"a sample of the beer that was gone,—and in this respect I remember","Great Expectations"
"those recluses as being like most others.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Behind the furthest end of the brewery, was a rank garden with an old","Great Expectations"
"wall; not so high but that I could struggle up and hold on long enough","Great Expectations"
"to look over it, and see that the rank garden was the garden of the","Great Expectations"
"house, and that it was overgrown with tangled weeds, but that there was","Great Expectations"
"a track upon the green and yellow paths, as if some one sometimes","Great Expectations"
"walked there, and that Estella was walking away from me even then. But","Great Expectations"
"she seemed to be everywhere. For when I yielded to the temptation","Great Expectations"
"presented by the casks, and began to walk on them, I saw _her_ walking","Great Expectations"
"on them at the end of the yard of casks. She had her back towards me,","Great Expectations"
"and held her pretty brown hair spread out in her two hands, and never","Great Expectations"
"looked round, and passed out of my view directly. So, in the brewery","Great Expectations"
"itself,—by which I mean the large paved lofty place in which they used","Great Expectations"
"to make the beer, and where the brewing utensils still were. When I","Great Expectations"
"first went into it, and, rather oppressed by its gloom, stood near the","Great Expectations"
"door looking about me, I saw her pass among the extinguished fires, and","Great Expectations"
"ascend some light iron stairs, and go out by a gallery high overhead,","Great Expectations"
"as if she were going out into the sky.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was in this place, and at this moment, that a strange thing happened","Great Expectations"
"to my fancy. I thought it a strange thing then, and I thought it a","Great Expectations"
"stranger thing long afterwards. I turned my eyes—a little dimmed by","Great Expectations"
"looking up at the frosty light—towards a great wooden beam in a low","Great Expectations"
"nook of the building near me on my right hand, and I saw a figure","Great Expectations"
"hanging there by the neck. A figure all in yellow white, with but one","Great Expectations"
"shoe to the feet; and it hung so, that I could see that the faded","Great Expectations"
"trimmings of the dress were like earthy paper, and that the face was","Great Expectations"
"Miss Havisham’s, with a movement going over the whole countenance as if","Great Expectations"
"she were trying to call to me. In the terror of seeing the figure, and","Great Expectations"
"in the terror of being certain that it had not been there a moment","Great Expectations"
"before, I at first ran from it, and then ran towards it. And my terror","Great Expectations"
"was greatest of all when I found no figure there.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Nothing less than the frosty light of the cheerful sky, the sight of","Great Expectations"
"people passing beyond the bars of the court-yard gate, and the reviving","Great Expectations"
"influence of the rest of the bread and meat and beer, would have","Great Expectations"
"brought me round. Even with those aids, I might not have come to myself","Great Expectations"
"as soon as I did, but that I saw Estella approaching with the keys, to","Great Expectations"
"let me out. She would have some fair reason for looking down upon me, I","Great Expectations"
"thought, if she saw me frightened; and she would have no fair reason.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"She gave me a triumphant glance in passing me, as if she rejoiced that","Great Expectations"
"my hands were so coarse and my boots were so thick, and she opened the","Great Expectations"
"gate, and stood holding it. I was passing out without looking at her,","Great Expectations"
"when she touched me with a taunting hand.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Why don’t you cry?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Because I don’t want to.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You do,” said she. “You have been crying till you are half blind, and","Great Expectations"
"you are near crying again now.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"She laughed contemptuously, pushed me out, and locked the gate upon me.","Great Expectations"
"I went straight to Mr. Pumblechook’s, and was immensely relieved to","Great Expectations"
"find him not at home. So, leaving word with the shopman on what day I","Great Expectations"
"was wanted at Miss Havisham’s again, I set off on the four-mile walk to","Great Expectations"
"our forge; pondering, as I went along, on all I had seen, and deeply","Great Expectations"
"revolving that I was a common labouring-boy; that my hands were coarse;","Great Expectations"
"that my boots were thick; that I had fallen into a despicable habit of","Great Expectations"
"calling knaves Jacks; that I was much more ignorant than I had","Great Expectations"
"considered myself last night, and generally that I was in a low-lived","Great Expectations"
"bad way.","Great Expectations"

"Chapter IX.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"When I reached home, my sister was very curious to know all about Miss","Great Expectations"
"Havisham’s, and asked a number of questions. And I soon found myself","Great Expectations"
"getting heavily bumped from behind in the nape of the neck and the","Great Expectations"
"small of the back, and having my face ignominiously shoved against the","Great Expectations"
"kitchen wall, because I did not answer those questions at sufficient","Great Expectations"
"length.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"If a dread of not being understood be hidden in the breasts of other","Great Expectations"
"young people to anything like the extent to which it used to be hidden","Great Expectations"
"in mine,—which I consider probable, as I have no particular reason to","Great Expectations"
"suspect myself of having been a monstrosity,—it is the key to many","Great Expectations"
"reservations. I felt convinced that if I described Miss Havisham’s as","Great Expectations"
"my eyes had seen it, I should not be understood. Not only that, but I","Great Expectations"
"felt convinced that Miss Havisham too would not be understood; and","Great Expectations"
"although she was perfectly incomprehensible to me, I entertained an","Great Expectations"
"impression that there would be something coarse and treacherous in my","Great Expectations"
"dragging her as she really was (to say nothing of Miss Estella) before","Great Expectations"
"the contemplation of Mrs. Joe. Consequently, I said as little as I","Great Expectations"
"could, and had my face shoved against the kitchen wall.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The worst of it was that that bullying old Pumblechook, preyed upon by","Great Expectations"
"a devouring curiosity to be informed of all I had seen and heard, came","Great Expectations"
"gaping over in his chaise-cart at tea-time, to have the details","Great Expectations"
"divulged to him. And the mere sight of the torment, with his fishy eyes","Great Expectations"
"and mouth open, his sandy hair inquisitively on end, and his waistcoat","Great Expectations"
"heaving with windy arithmetic, made me vicious in my reticence.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well, boy,” Uncle Pumblechook began, as soon as he was seated in the","Great Expectations"
"chair of honour by the fire. “How did you get on up town?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I answered, “Pretty well, sir,” and my sister shook her fist at me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Pretty well?” Mr. Pumblechook repeated. “Pretty well is no answer.","Great Expectations"
"Tell us what you mean by pretty well, boy?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Whitewash on the forehead hardens the brain into a state of obstinacy","Great Expectations"
"perhaps. Anyhow, with whitewash from the wall on my forehead, my","Great Expectations"
"obstinacy was adamantine. I reflected for some time, and then answered","Great Expectations"
"as if I had discovered a new idea, “I mean pretty well.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"My sister with an exclamation of impatience was going to fly at me,—I","Great Expectations"
"had no shadow of defence, for Joe was busy in the forge,—when Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Pumblechook interposed with “No! Don’t lose your temper. Leave this lad","Great Expectations"
"to me, ma’am; leave this lad to me.” Mr. Pumblechook then turned me","Great Expectations"
"towards him, as if he were going to cut my hair, and said,—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“First (to get our thoughts in order): Forty-three pence?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I calculated the consequences of replying “Four Hundred Pound,” and","Great Expectations"
"finding them against me, went as near the answer as I could—which was","Great Expectations"
"somewhere about eightpence off. Mr. Pumblechook then put me through my","Great Expectations"
"pence-table from “twelve pence make one shilling,” up to “forty pence","Great Expectations"
"make three and fourpence,” and then triumphantly demanded, as if he had","Great Expectations"
"done for me, “_Now!_ How much is forty-three pence?” To which I","Great Expectations"
"replied, after a long interval of reflection, “I don’t know.” And I was","Great Expectations"
"so aggravated that I almost doubt if I did know.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Pumblechook worked his head like a screw to screw it out of me, and","Great Expectations"
"said, “Is forty-three pence seven and sixpence three fardens, for","Great Expectations"
"instance?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes!” said I. And although my sister instantly boxed my ears, it was","Great Expectations"
"highly gratifying to me to see that the answer spoilt his joke, and","Great Expectations"
"brought him to a dead stop.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Boy! What like is Miss Havisham?” Mr. Pumblechook began again when he","Great Expectations"
"had recovered; folding his arms tight on his chest and applying the","Great Expectations"
"screw.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Very tall and dark,” I told him.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Is she, uncle?” asked my sister.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Pumblechook winked assent; from which I at once inferred that he","Great Expectations"
"had never seen Miss Havisham, for she was nothing of the kind.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Good!” said Mr. Pumblechook conceitedly. (“This is the way to have","Great Expectations"
"him! We are beginning to hold our own, I think, Mum?”)","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I am sure, uncle,” returned Mrs. Joe, “I wish you had him always; you","Great Expectations"
"know so well how to deal with him.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Now, boy! What was she a-doing of, when you went in today?” asked Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Pumblechook.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“She was sitting,” I answered, “in a black velvet coach.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Pumblechook and Mrs. Joe stared at one another—as they well","Great Expectations"
"might—and both repeated, “In a black velvet coach?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes,” said I. “And Miss Estella—that’s her niece, I think—handed her","Great Expectations"
"in cake and wine at the coach-window, on a gold plate. And we all had","Great Expectations"
"cake and wine on gold plates. And I got up behind the coach to eat","Great Expectations"
"mine, because she told me to.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Was anybody else there?” asked Mr. Pumblechook.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Four dogs,” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Large or small?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Immense,” said I. “And they fought for veal-cutlets out of a silver","Great Expectations"
"basket.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Pumblechook and Mrs. Joe stared at one another again, in utter","Great Expectations"
"amazement. I was perfectly frantic,—a reckless witness under the","Great Expectations"
"torture,—and would have told them anything.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Where _was_ this coach, in the name of gracious?” asked my sister.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“In Miss Havisham’s room.” They stared again. “But there weren’t any","Great Expectations"
"horses to it.” I added this saving clause, in the moment of rejecting","Great Expectations"
"four richly caparisoned coursers which I had had wild thoughts of","Great Expectations"
"harnessing.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Can this be possible, uncle?” asked Mrs. Joe. “What can the boy mean?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I’ll tell you, Mum,” said Mr. Pumblechook. “My opinion is, it’s a","Great Expectations"
"sedan-chair. She’s flighty, you know,—very flighty,—quite flighty","Great Expectations"
"enough to pass her days in a sedan-chair.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Did you ever see her in it, uncle?” asked Mrs. Joe.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“How could I,” he returned, forced to the admission, “when I never see","Great Expectations"
"her in my life? Never clapped eyes upon her!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Goodness, uncle! And yet you have spoken to her?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Why, don’t you know,” said Mr. Pumblechook, testily, “that when I have","Great Expectations"
"been there, I have been took up to the outside of her door, and the","Great Expectations"
"door has stood ajar, and she has spoke to me that way. Don’t say you","Great Expectations"
"don’t know _that_, Mum. Howsever, the boy went there to play. What did","Great Expectations"
"you play at, boy?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“We played with flags,” I said. (I beg to observe that I think of","Great Expectations"
"myself with amazement, when I recall the lies I told on this occasion.)","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Flags!” echoed my sister.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes,” said I. “Estella waved a blue flag, and I waved a red one, and","Great Expectations"
"Miss Havisham waved one sprinkled all over with little gold stars, out","Great Expectations"
"at the coach-window. And then we all waved our swords and hurrahed.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Swords!” repeated my sister. “Where did you get swords from?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Out of a cupboard,” said I. “And I saw pistols in it,—and jam,—and","Great Expectations"
"pills. And there was no daylight in the room, but it was all lighted up","Great Expectations"
"with candles.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“That’s true, Mum,” said Mr. Pumblechook, with a grave nod. “That’s the","Great Expectations"
"state of the case, for that much I’ve seen myself.” And then they both","Great Expectations"
"stared at me, and I, with an obtrusive show of artlessness on my","Great Expectations"
"countenance, stared at them, and plaited the right leg of my trousers","Great Expectations"
"with my right hand.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"If they had asked me any more questions, I should undoubtedly have","Great Expectations"
"betrayed myself, for I was even then on the point of mentioning that","Great Expectations"
"there was a balloon in the yard, and should have hazarded the statement","Great Expectations"
"but for my invention being divided between that phenomenon and a bear","Great Expectations"
"in the brewery. They were so much occupied, however, in discussing the","Great Expectations"
"marvels I had already presented for their consideration, that I","Great Expectations"
"escaped. The subject still held them when Joe came in from his work to","Great Expectations"
"have a cup of tea. To whom my sister, more for the relief of her own","Great Expectations"
"mind than for the gratification of his, related my pretended","Great Expectations"
"experiences.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Now, when I saw Joe open his blue eyes and roll them all round the","Great Expectations"
"kitchen in helpless amazement, I was overtaken by penitence; but only","Great Expectations"
"as regarded him,—not in the least as regarded the other two. Towards","Great Expectations"
"Joe, and Joe only, I considered myself a young monster, while they sat","Great Expectations"
"debating what results would come to me from Miss Havisham’s","Great Expectations"
"acquaintance and favour. They had no doubt that Miss Havisham would “do","Great Expectations"
"something” for me; their doubts related to the form that something","Great Expectations"
"would take. My sister stood out for “property.” Mr. Pumblechook was in","Great Expectations"
"favour of a handsome premium for binding me apprentice to some genteel","Great Expectations"
"trade,—say, the corn and seed trade, for instance. Joe fell into the","Great Expectations"
"deepest disgrace with both, for offering the bright suggestion that I","Great Expectations"
"might only be presented with one of the dogs who had fought for the","Great Expectations"
"veal-cutlets. “If a fool’s head can’t express better opinions than","Great Expectations"
"that,” said my sister, “and you have got any work to do, you had better","Great Expectations"
"go and do it.” So he went.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"After Mr. Pumblechook had driven off, and when my sister was washing","Great Expectations"
"up, I stole into the forge to Joe, and remained by him until he had","Great Expectations"
"done for the night. Then I said, “Before the fire goes out, Joe, I","Great Expectations"
"should like to tell you something.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Should you, Pip?” said Joe, drawing his shoeing-stool near the forge.","Great Expectations"
"“Then tell us. What is it, Pip?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Joe,” said I, taking hold of his rolled-up shirt sleeve, and twisting","Great Expectations"
"it between my finger and thumb, “you remember all that about Miss","Great Expectations"
"Havisham’s?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Remember?” said Joe. “I believe you! Wonderful!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It’s a terrible thing, Joe; it ain’t true.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What are you telling of, Pip?” cried Joe, falling back in the greatest","Great Expectations"
"amazement. “You don’t mean to say it’s—”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes I do; it’s lies, Joe.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“But not all of it? Why sure you don’t mean to say, Pip, that there was","Great Expectations"
"no black welwet co—eh?” For, I stood shaking my head. “But at least","Great Expectations"
"there was dogs, Pip? Come, Pip,” said Joe, persuasively, “if there","Great Expectations"
"warn’t no weal-cutlets, at least there was dogs?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No, Joe.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“A dog?” said Joe. “A puppy? Come?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No, Joe, there was nothing at all of the kind.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As I fixed my eyes hopelessly on Joe, Joe contemplated me in dismay.","Great Expectations"
"“Pip, old chap! This won’t do, old fellow! I say! Where do you expect","Great Expectations"
"to go to?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It’s terrible, Joe; ain’t it?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Terrible?” cried Joe. “Awful! What possessed you?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I don’t know what possessed me, Joe,” I replied, letting his shirt","Great Expectations"
"sleeve go, and sitting down in the ashes at his feet, hanging my head;","Great Expectations"
"“but I wish you hadn’t taught me to call Knaves at cards Jacks; and I","Great Expectations"
"wish my boots weren’t so thick nor my hands so coarse.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"And then I told Joe that I felt very miserable, and that I hadn’t been","Great Expectations"
"able to explain myself to Mrs. Joe and Pumblechook, who were so rude to","Great Expectations"
"me, and that there had been a beautiful young lady at Miss Havisham’s","Great Expectations"
"who was dreadfully proud, and that she had said I was common, and that","Great Expectations"
"I knew I was common, and that I wished I was not common, and that the","Great Expectations"
"lies had come of it somehow, though I didn’t know how.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"This was a case of metaphysics, at least as difficult for Joe to deal","Great Expectations"
"with as for me. But Joe took the case altogether out of the region of","Great Expectations"
"metaphysics, and by that means vanquished it.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“There’s one thing you may be sure of, Pip,” said Joe, after some","Great Expectations"
"rumination, “namely, that lies is lies. Howsever they come, they didn’t","Great Expectations"
"ought to come, and they come from the father of lies, and work round to","Great Expectations"
"the same. Don’t you tell no more of ’em, Pip. _That_ ain’t the way to","Great Expectations"
"get out of being common, old chap. And as to being common, I don’t make","Great Expectations"
"it out at all clear. You are oncommon in some things. You’re oncommon","Great Expectations"
"small. Likewise you’re a oncommon scholar.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No, I am ignorant and backward, Joe.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Why, see what a letter you wrote last night! Wrote in print even! I’ve","Great Expectations"
"seen letters—Ah! and from gentlefolks!—that I’ll swear weren’t wrote in","Great Expectations"
"print,” said Joe.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I have learnt next to nothing, Joe. You think much of me. It’s only","Great Expectations"
"that.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well, Pip,” said Joe, “be it so or be it son’t, you must be a common","Great Expectations"
"scholar afore you can be a oncommon one, I should hope! The king upon","Great Expectations"
"his throne, with his crown upon his ed, can’t sit and write his acts of","Great Expectations"
"Parliament in print, without having begun, when he were a unpromoted","Great Expectations"
"Prince, with the alphabet.—Ah!” added Joe, with a shake of the head","Great Expectations"
"that was full of meaning, “and begun at A too, and worked his way to Z.","Great Expectations"
"And _I_ know what that is to do, though I can’t say I’ve exactly done","Great Expectations"
"it.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"There was some hope in this piece of wisdom, and it rather encouraged","Great Expectations"
"me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Whether common ones as to callings and earnings,” pursued Joe,","Great Expectations"
"reflectively, “mightn’t be the better of continuing for to keep company","Great Expectations"
"with common ones, instead of going out to play with oncommon","Great Expectations"
"ones,—which reminds me to hope that there were a flag, perhaps?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No, Joe.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“(I’m sorry there weren’t a flag, Pip). Whether that might be or","Great Expectations"
"mightn’t be, is a thing as can’t be looked into now, without putting","Great Expectations"
"your sister on the Rampage; and that’s a thing not to be thought of as","Great Expectations"
"being done intentional. Lookee here, Pip, at what is said to you by a","Great Expectations"
"true friend. Which this to you the true friend say. If you can’t get to","Great Expectations"
"be oncommon through going straight, you’ll never get to do it through","Great Expectations"
"going crooked. So don’t tell no more on ’em, Pip, and live well and die","Great Expectations"
"happy.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You are not angry with me, Joe?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No, old chap. But bearing in mind that them were which I meantersay of","Great Expectations"
"a stunning and outdacious sort,—alluding to them which bordered on","Great Expectations"
"weal-cutlets and dog-fighting,—a sincere well-wisher would adwise, Pip,","Great Expectations"
"their being dropped into your meditations, when you go upstairs to bed.","Great Expectations"
"That’s all, old chap, and don’t never do it no more.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"When I got up to my little room and said my prayers, I did not forget","Great Expectations"
"Joe’s recommendation, and yet my young mind was in that disturbed and","Great Expectations"
"unthankful state, that I thought long after I laid me down, how common","Great Expectations"
"Estella would consider Joe, a mere blacksmith; how thick his boots, and","Great Expectations"
"how coarse his hands. I thought how Joe and my sister were then sitting","Great Expectations"
"in the kitchen, and how I had come up to bed from the kitchen, and how","Great Expectations"
"Miss Havisham and Estella never sat in a kitchen, but were far above","Great Expectations"
"the level of such common doings. I fell asleep recalling what I “used","Great Expectations"
"to do” when I was at Miss Havisham’s; as though I had been there weeks","Great Expectations"
"or months, instead of hours; and as though it were quite an old subject","Great Expectations"
"of remembrance, instead of one that had arisen only that day.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"That was a memorable day to me, for it made great changes in me. But it","Great Expectations"
"is the same with any life. Imagine one selected day struck out of it,","Great Expectations"
"and think how different its course would have been. Pause you who read","Great Expectations"
"this, and think for a moment of the long chain of iron or gold, of","Great Expectations"
"thorns or flowers, that would never have bound you, but for the","Great Expectations"
"formation of the first link on one memorable day.","Great Expectations"

"Chapter X.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The felicitous idea occurred to me a morning or two later when I woke,","Great Expectations"
"that the best step I could take towards making myself uncommon was to","Great Expectations"
"get out of Biddy everything she knew. In pursuance of this luminous","Great Expectations"
"conception I mentioned to Biddy when I went to Mr. Wopsle’s","Great Expectations"
"great-aunt’s at night, that I had a particular reason for wishing to","Great Expectations"
"get on in life, and that I should feel very much obliged to her if she","Great Expectations"
"would impart all her learning to me. Biddy, who was the most obliging","Great Expectations"
"of girls, immediately said she would, and indeed began to carry out her","Great Expectations"
"promise within five minutes.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The Educational scheme or Course established by Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt","Great Expectations"
"may be resolved into the following synopsis. The pupils ate apples and","Great Expectations"
"put straws down one another’s backs, until Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt","Great Expectations"
"collected her energies, and made an indiscriminate totter at them with","Great Expectations"
"a birch-rod. After receiving the charge with every mark of derision,","Great Expectations"
"the pupils formed in line and buzzingly passed a ragged book from hand","Great Expectations"
"to hand. The book had an alphabet in it, some figures and tables, and a","Great Expectations"
"little spelling,—that is to say, it had had once. As soon as this","Great Expectations"
"volume began to circulate, Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt fell into a state of","Great Expectations"
"coma, arising either from sleep or a rheumatic paroxysm. The pupils","Great Expectations"
"then entered among themselves upon a competitive examination on the","Great Expectations"
"subject of Boots, with the view of ascertaining who could tread the","Great Expectations"
"hardest upon whose toes. This mental exercise lasted until Biddy made a","Great Expectations"
"rush at them and distributed three defaced Bibles (shaped as if they","Great Expectations"
"had been unskilfully cut off the chump end of something), more","Great Expectations"
"illegibly printed at the best than any curiosities of literature I have","Great Expectations"
"since met with, speckled all over with ironmould, and having various","Great Expectations"
"specimens of the insect world smashed between their leaves. This part","Great Expectations"
"of the Course was usually lightened by several single combats between","Great Expectations"
"Biddy and refractory students. When the fights were over, Biddy gave","Great Expectations"
"out the number of a page, and then we all read aloud what we could,—or","Great Expectations"
"what we couldn’t—in a frightful chorus; Biddy leading with a high,","Great Expectations"
"shrill, monotonous voice, and none of us having the least notion of, or","Great Expectations"
"reverence for, what we were reading about. When this horrible din had","Great Expectations"
"lasted a certain time, it mechanically awoke Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt,","Great Expectations"
"who staggered at a boy fortuitously, and pulled his ears. This was","Great Expectations"
"understood to terminate the Course for the evening, and we emerged into","Great Expectations"
"the air with shrieks of intellectual victory. It is fair to remark that","Great Expectations"
"there was no prohibition against any pupil’s entertaining himself with","Great Expectations"
"a slate or even with the ink (when there was any), but that it was not","Great Expectations"
"easy to pursue that branch of study in the winter season, on account of","Great Expectations"
"the little general shop in which the classes were holden—and which was","Great Expectations"
"also Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt’s sitting-room and bedchamber—being but","Great Expectations"
"faintly illuminated through the agency of one low-spirited dip-candle","Great Expectations"
"and no snuffers.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It appeared to me that it would take time to become uncommon, under","Great Expectations"
"these circumstances: nevertheless, I resolved to try it, and that very","Great Expectations"
"evening Biddy entered on our special agreement, by imparting some","Great Expectations"
"information from her little catalogue of Prices, under the head of","Great Expectations"
"moist sugar, and lending me, to copy at home, a large old English D","Great Expectations"
"which she had imitated from the heading of some newspaper, and which I","Great Expectations"
"supposed, until she told me what it was, to be a design for a buckle.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Of course there was a public-house in the village, and of course Joe","Great Expectations"
"liked sometimes to smoke his pipe there. I had received strict orders","Great Expectations"
"from my sister to call for him at the Three Jolly Bargemen, that","Great Expectations"
"evening, on my way from school, and bring him home at my peril. To the","Great Expectations"
"Three Jolly Bargemen, therefore, I directed my steps.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"There was a bar at the Jolly Bargemen, with some alarmingly long chalk","Great Expectations"
"scores in it on the wall at the side of the door, which seemed to me to","Great Expectations"
"be never paid off. They had been there ever since I could remember, and","Great Expectations"
"had grown more than I had. But there was a quantity of chalk about our","Great Expectations"
"country, and perhaps the people neglected no opportunity of turning it","Great Expectations"
"to account.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It being Saturday night, I found the landlord looking rather grimly at","Great Expectations"
"these records; but as my business was with Joe and not with him, I","Great Expectations"
"merely wished him good evening, and passed into the common room at the","Great Expectations"
"end of the passage, where there was a bright large kitchen fire, and","Great Expectations"
"where Joe was smoking his pipe in company with Mr. Wopsle and a","Great Expectations"
"stranger. Joe greeted me as usual with “Halloa, Pip, old chap!” and the","Great Expectations"
"moment he said that, the stranger turned his head and looked at me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He was a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before. His head was","Great Expectations"
"all on one side, and one of his eyes was half shut up, as if he were","Great Expectations"
"taking aim at something with an invisible gun. He had a pipe in his","Great Expectations"
"mouth, and he took it out, and, after slowly blowing all his smoke away","Great Expectations"
"and looking hard at me all the time, nodded. So, I nodded, and then he","Great Expectations"
"nodded again, and made room on the settle beside him that I might sit","Great Expectations"
"down there.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"But as I was used to sit beside Joe whenever I entered that place of","Great Expectations"
"resort, I said “No, thank you, sir,” and fell into the space Joe made","Great Expectations"
"for me on the opposite settle. The strange man, after glancing at Joe,","Great Expectations"
"and seeing that his attention was otherwise engaged, nodded to me again","Great Expectations"
"when I had taken my seat, and then rubbed his leg—in a very odd way, as","Great Expectations"
"it struck me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You was saying,” said the strange man, turning to Joe, “that you was a","Great Expectations"
"blacksmith.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes. I said it, you know,” said Joe.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What’ll you drink, Mr.—? You didn’t mention your name, by the bye.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Joe mentioned it now, and the strange man called him by it. “What’ll","Great Expectations"
"you drink, Mr. Gargery? At my expense? To top up with?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well,” said Joe, “to tell you the truth, I ain’t much in the habit of","Great Expectations"
"drinking at anybody’s expense but my own.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Habit? No,” returned the stranger, “but once and away, and on a","Great Expectations"
"Saturday night too. Come! Put a name to it, Mr. Gargery.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I wouldn’t wish to be stiff company,” said Joe. “Rum.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Rum,” repeated the stranger. “And will the other gentleman originate a","Great Expectations"
"sentiment.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Rum,” said Mr. Wopsle.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Three Rums!” cried the stranger, calling to the landlord. “Glasses","Great Expectations"
"round!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“This other gentleman,” observed Joe, by way of introducing Mr. Wopsle,","Great Expectations"
"“is a gentleman that you would like to hear give it out. Our clerk at","Great Expectations"
"church.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Aha!” said the stranger, quickly, and cocking his eye at me. “The","Great Expectations"
"lonely church, right out on the marshes, with graves round it!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“That’s it,” said Joe.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The stranger, with a comfortable kind of grunt over his pipe, put his","Great Expectations"
"legs up on the settle that he had to himself. He wore a flapping","Great Expectations"
"broad-brimmed traveller’s hat, and under it a handkerchief tied over","Great Expectations"
"his head in the manner of a cap: so that he showed no hair. As he","Great Expectations"
"looked at the fire, I thought I saw a cunning expression, followed by a","Great Expectations"
"half-laugh, come into his face.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I am not acquainted with this country, gentlemen, but it seems a","Great Expectations"
"solitary country towards the river.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Most marshes is solitary,” said Joe.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No doubt, no doubt. Do you find any gypsies, now, or tramps, or","Great Expectations"
"vagrants of any sort, out there?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No,” said Joe; “none but a runaway convict now and then. And we don’t","Great Expectations"
"find _them_, easy. Eh, Mr. Wopsle?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Wopsle, with a majestic remembrance of old discomfiture, assented;","Great Expectations"
"but not warmly.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Seems you have been out after such?” asked the stranger.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Once,” returned Joe. “Not that we wanted to take them, you understand;","Great Expectations"
"we went out as lookers on; me, and Mr. Wopsle, and Pip. Didn’t us,","Great Expectations"
"Pip?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, Joe.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The stranger looked at me again,—still cocking his eye, as if he were","Great Expectations"
"expressly taking aim at me with his invisible gun,—and said, “He’s a","Great Expectations"
"likely young parcel of bones that. What is it you call him?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Pip,” said Joe.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Christened Pip?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No, not christened Pip.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Surname Pip?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No,” said Joe, “it’s a kind of family name what he gave himself when a","Great Expectations"
"infant, and is called by.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Son of yours?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well,” said Joe, meditatively, not, of course, that it could be in","Great Expectations"
"anywise necessary to consider about it, but because it was the way at","Great Expectations"
"the Jolly Bargemen to seem to consider deeply about everything that was","Great Expectations"
"discussed over pipes,—“well—no. No, he ain’t.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Nevvy?” said the strange man.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well,” said Joe, with the same appearance of profound cogitation, “he","Great Expectations"
"is not—no, not to deceive you, he is _not_—my nevvy.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What the Blue Blazes is he?” asked the stranger. Which appeared to me","Great Expectations"
"to be an inquiry of unnecessary strength.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Wopsle struck in upon that; as one who knew all about","Great Expectations"
"relationships, having professional occasion to bear in mind what female","Great Expectations"
"relations a man might not marry; and expounded the ties between me and","Great Expectations"
"Joe. Having his hand in, Mr. Wopsle finished off with a most","Great Expectations"
"terrifically snarling passage from Richard the Third, and seemed to","Great Expectations"
"think he had done quite enough to account for it when he added, “—as","Great Expectations"
"the poet says.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"And here I may remark that when Mr. Wopsle referred to me, he","Great Expectations"
"considered it a necessary part of such reference to rumple my hair and","Great Expectations"
"poke it into my eyes. I cannot conceive why everybody of his standing","Great Expectations"
"who visited at our house should always have put me through the same","Great Expectations"
"inflammatory process under similar circumstances. Yet I do not call to","Great Expectations"
"mind that I was ever in my earlier youth the subject of remark in our","Great Expectations"
"social family circle, but some large-handed person took some such","Great Expectations"
"ophthalmic steps to patronise me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"All this while, the strange man looked at nobody but me, and looked at","Great Expectations"
"me as if he were determined to have a shot at me at last, and bring me","Great Expectations"
"down. But he said nothing after offering his Blue Blazes observation,","Great Expectations"
"until the glasses of rum and water were brought; and then he made his","Great Expectations"
"shot, and a most extraordinary shot it was.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was not a verbal remark, but a proceeding in dumb-show, and was","Great Expectations"
"pointedly addressed to me. He stirred his rum and water pointedly at","Great Expectations"
"me, and he tasted his rum and water pointedly at me. And he stirred it","Great Expectations"
"and he tasted it; not with a spoon that was brought to him, but _with a","Great Expectations"
"file_.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He did this so that nobody but I saw the file; and when he had done it","Great Expectations"
"he wiped the file and put it in a breast-pocket. I knew it to be Joe’s","Great Expectations"
"file, and I knew that he knew my convict, the moment I saw the","Great Expectations"
"instrument. I sat gazing at him, spell-bound. But he now reclined on","Great Expectations"
"his settle, taking very little notice of me, and talking principally","Great Expectations"
"about turnips.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"There was a delicious sense of cleaning-up and making a quiet pause","Great Expectations"
"before going on in life afresh, in our village on Saturday nights,","Great Expectations"
"which stimulated Joe to dare to stay out half an hour longer on","Great Expectations"
"Saturdays than at other times. The half-hour and the rum and water","Great Expectations"
"running out together, Joe got up to go, and took me by the hand.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Stop half a moment, Mr. Gargery,” said the strange man. “I think I’ve","Great Expectations"
"got a bright new shilling somewhere in my pocket, and if I have, the","Great Expectations"
"boy shall have it.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He looked it out from a handful of small change, folded it in some","Great Expectations"
"crumpled paper, and gave it to me. “Yours!” said he. “Mind! Your own.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I thanked him, staring at him far beyond the bounds of good manners,","Great Expectations"
"and holding tight to Joe. He gave Joe good-night, and he gave Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Wopsle good-night (who went out with us), and he gave me only a look","Great Expectations"
"with his aiming eye,—no, not a look, for he shut it up, but wonders may","Great Expectations"
"be done with an eye by hiding it.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"On the way home, if I had been in a humour for talking, the talk must","Great Expectations"
"have been all on my side, for Mr. Wopsle parted from us at the door of","Great Expectations"
"the Jolly Bargemen, and Joe went all the way home with his mouth wide","Great Expectations"
"open, to rinse the rum out with as much air as possible. But I was in a","Great Expectations"
"manner stupefied by this turning up of my old misdeed and old","Great Expectations"
"acquaintance, and could think of nothing else.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"My sister was not in a very bad temper when we presented ourselves in","Great Expectations"
"the kitchen, and Joe was encouraged by that unusual circumstance to","Great Expectations"
"tell her about the bright shilling. “A bad un, I’ll be bound,” said","Great Expectations"
"Mrs. Joe triumphantly, “or he wouldn’t have given it to the boy! Let’s","Great Expectations"
"look at it.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I took it out of the paper, and it proved to be a good one. “But what’s","Great Expectations"
"this?” said Mrs. Joe, throwing down the shilling and catching up the","Great Expectations"
"paper. “Two One-Pound notes?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Nothing less than two fat sweltering one-pound notes that seemed to","Great Expectations"
"have been on terms of the warmest intimacy with all the cattle-markets","Great Expectations"
"in the county. Joe caught up his hat again, and ran with them to the","Great Expectations"
"Jolly Bargemen to restore them to their owner. While he was gone, I sat","Great Expectations"
"down on my usual stool and looked vacantly at my sister, feeling pretty","Great Expectations"
"sure that the man would not be there.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Presently, Joe came back, saying that the man was gone, but that he,","Great Expectations"
"Joe, had left word at the Three Jolly Bargemen concerning the notes.","Great Expectations"
"Then my sister sealed them up in a piece of paper, and put them under","Great Expectations"
"some dried rose-leaves in an ornamental teapot on the top of a press in","Great Expectations"
"the state parlour. There they remained, a nightmare to me, many and","Great Expectations"
"many a night and day.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I had sadly broken sleep when I got to bed, through thinking of the","Great Expectations"
"strange man taking aim at me with his invisible gun, and of the","Great Expectations"
"guiltily coarse and common thing it was, to be on secret terms of","Great Expectations"
"conspiracy with convicts,—a feature in my low career that I had","Great Expectations"
"previously forgotten. I was haunted by the file too. A dread possessed","Great Expectations"
"me that when I least expected it, the file would reappear. I coaxed","Great Expectations"
"myself to sleep by thinking of Miss Havisham’s, next Wednesday; and in","Great Expectations"
"my sleep I saw the file coming at me out of a door, without seeing who","Great Expectations"
"held it, and I screamed myself awake.","Great Expectations"

"Chapter XI.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"At the appointed time I returned to Miss Havisham’s, and my hesitating","Great Expectations"
"ring at the gate brought out Estella. She locked it after admitting me,","Great Expectations"
"as she had done before, and again preceded me into the dark passage","Great Expectations"
"where her candle stood. She took no notice of me until she had the","Great Expectations"
"candle in her hand, when she looked over her shoulder, superciliously","Great Expectations"
"saying, “You are to come this way to-day,” and took me to quite another","Great Expectations"
"part of the house.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The passage was a long one, and seemed to pervade the whole square","Great Expectations"
"basement of the Manor House. We traversed but one side of the square,","Great Expectations"
"however, and at the end of it she stopped, and put her candle down and","Great Expectations"
"opened a door. Here, the daylight reappeared, and I found myself in a","Great Expectations"
"small paved courtyard, the opposite side of which was formed by a","Great Expectations"
"detached dwelling-house, that looked as if it had once belonged to the","Great Expectations"
"manager or head clerk of the extinct brewery. There was a clock in the","Great Expectations"
"outer wall of this house. Like the clock in Miss Havisham’s room, and","Great Expectations"
"like Miss Havisham’s watch, it had stopped at twenty minutes to nine.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We went in at the door, which stood open, and into a gloomy room with a","Great Expectations"
"low ceiling, on the ground-floor at the back. There was some company in","Great Expectations"
"the room, and Estella said to me as she joined it, “You are to go and","Great Expectations"
"stand there boy, till you are wanted.” “There”, being the window, I","Great Expectations"
"crossed to it, and stood “there,” in a very uncomfortable state of","Great Expectations"
"mind, looking out.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It opened to the ground, and looked into a most miserable corner of the","Great Expectations"
"neglected garden, upon a rank ruin of cabbage-stalks, and one box-tree","Great Expectations"
"that had been clipped round long ago, like a pudding, and had a new","Great Expectations"
"growth at the top of it, out of shape and of a different colour, as if","Great Expectations"
"that part of the pudding had stuck to the saucepan and got burnt. This","Great Expectations"
"was my homely thought, as I contemplated the box-tree. There had been","Great Expectations"
"some light snow, overnight, and it lay nowhere else to my knowledge;","Great Expectations"
"but, it had not quite melted from the cold shadow of this bit of","Great Expectations"
"garden, and the wind caught it up in little eddies and threw it at the","Great Expectations"
"window, as if it pelted me for coming there.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I divined that my coming had stopped conversation in the room, and that","Great Expectations"
"its other occupants were looking at me. I could see nothing of the room","Great Expectations"
"except the shining of the fire in the window-glass, but I stiffened in","Great Expectations"
"all my joints with the consciousness that I was under close inspection.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"There were three ladies in the room and one gentleman. Before I had","Great Expectations"
"been standing at the window five minutes, they somehow conveyed to me","Great Expectations"
"that they were all toadies and humbugs, but that each of them pretended","Great Expectations"
"not to know that the others were toadies and humbugs: because the","Great Expectations"
"admission that he or she did know it, would have made him or her out to","Great Expectations"
"be a toady and humbug.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"They all had a listless and dreary air of waiting somebody’s pleasure,","Great Expectations"
"and the most talkative of the ladies had to speak quite rigidly to","Great Expectations"
"repress a yawn. This lady, whose name was Camilla, very much reminded","Great Expectations"
"me of my sister, with the difference that she was older, and (as I","Great Expectations"
"found when I caught sight of her) of a blunter cast of features.","Great Expectations"
"Indeed, when I knew her better I began to think it was a Mercy she had","Great Expectations"
"any features at all, so very blank and high was the dead wall of her","Great Expectations"
"face.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Poor dear soul!” said this lady, with an abruptness of manner quite my","Great Expectations"
"sister’s. “Nobody’s enemy but his own!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It would be much more commendable to be somebody else’s enemy,” said","Great Expectations"
"the gentleman; “far more natural.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Cousin Raymond,” observed another lady, “we are to love our","Great Expectations"
"neighbour.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Sarah Pocket,” returned Cousin Raymond, “if a man is not his own","Great Expectations"
"neighbour, who is?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Miss Pocket laughed, and Camilla laughed and said (checking a yawn),","Great Expectations"
"“The idea!” But I thought they seemed to think it rather a good idea","Great Expectations"
"too. The other lady, who had not spoken yet, said gravely and","Great Expectations"
"emphatically, “_Very_ true!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Poor soul!” Camilla presently went on (I knew they had all been","Great Expectations"
"looking at me in the mean time), “he is so very strange! Would anyone","Great Expectations"
"believe that when Tom’s wife died, he actually could not be induced to","Great Expectations"
"see the importance of the children’s having the deepest of trimmings to","Great Expectations"
"their mourning? ‘Good Lord!’ says he, ‘Camilla, what can it signify so","Great Expectations"
"long as the poor bereaved little things are in black?’ So like Matthew!","Great Expectations"
"The idea!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Good points in him, good points in him,” said Cousin Raymond; “Heaven","Great Expectations"
"forbid I should deny good points in him; but he never had, and he never","Great Expectations"
"will have, any sense of the proprieties.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You know I was obliged,” said Camilla,—“I was obliged to be firm. I","Great Expectations"
"said, ‘It WILL NOT DO, for the credit of the family.’ I told him that,","Great Expectations"
"without deep trimmings, the family was disgraced. I cried about it from","Great Expectations"
"breakfast till dinner. I injured my digestion. And at last he flung out","Great Expectations"
"in his violent way, and said, with a D, ‘Then do as you like.’ Thank","Great Expectations"
"Goodness it will always be a consolation to me to know that I instantly","Great Expectations"
"went out in a pouring rain and bought the things.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“_He_ paid for them, did he not?” asked Estella.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It’s not the question, my dear child, who paid for them,” returned","Great Expectations"
"Camilla. “_I_ bought them. And I shall often think of that with peace,","Great Expectations"
"when I wake up in the night.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The ringing of a distant bell, combined with the echoing of some cry or","Great Expectations"
"call along the passage by which I had come, interrupted the","Great Expectations"
"conversation and caused Estella to say to me, “Now, boy!” On my turning","Great Expectations"
"round, they all looked at me with the utmost contempt, and, as I went","Great Expectations"
"out, I heard Sarah Pocket say, “Well I am sure! What next!” and Camilla","Great Expectations"
"add, with indignation, “Was there ever such a fancy! The i-d_e_-a!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As we were going with our candle along the dark passage, Estella","Great Expectations"
"stopped all of a sudden, and, facing round, said in her taunting","Great Expectations"
"manner, with her face quite close to mine,—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well, miss?” I answered, almost falling over her and checking myself.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"She stood looking at me, and, of course, I stood looking at her.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Am I pretty?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes; I think you are very pretty.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Am I insulting?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Not so much so as you were last time,” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Not so much so?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"She fired when she asked the last question, and she slapped my face","Great Expectations"
"with such force as she had, when I answered it.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Now?” said she. “You little coarse monster, what do you think of me","Great Expectations"
"now?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I shall not tell you.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Because you are going to tell upstairs. Is that it?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No,” said I, “that’s not it.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Why don’t you cry again, you little wretch?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Because I’ll never cry for you again,” said I. Which was, I suppose,","Great Expectations"
"as false a declaration as ever was made; for I was inwardly crying for","Great Expectations"
"her then, and I know what I know of the pain she cost me afterwards.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We went on our way upstairs after this episode; and, as we were going","Great Expectations"
"up, we met a gentleman groping his way down.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Whom have we here?” asked the gentleman, stopping and looking at me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“A boy,” said Estella.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He was a burly man of an exceedingly dark complexion, with an","Great Expectations"
"exceedingly large head, and a corresponding large hand. He took my chin","Great Expectations"
"in his large hand and turned up my face to have a look at me by the","Great Expectations"
"light of the candle. He was prematurely bald on the top of his head,","Great Expectations"
"and had bushy black eyebrows that wouldn’t lie down but stood up","Great Expectations"
"bristling. His eyes were set very deep in his head, and were","Great Expectations"
"disagreeably sharp and suspicious. He had a large watch-chain, and","Great Expectations"
"strong black dots where his beard and whiskers would have been if he","Great Expectations"
"had let them. He was nothing to me, and I could have had no foresight","Great Expectations"
"then, that he ever would be anything to me, but it happened that I had","Great Expectations"
"this opportunity of observing him well.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Boy of the neighbourhood? Hey?” said he.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, sir,” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“How do _you_ come here?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Miss Havisham sent for me, sir,” I explained.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well! Behave yourself. I have a pretty large experience of boys, and","Great Expectations"
"you’re a bad set of fellows. Now mind!” said he, biting the side of his","Great Expectations"
"great forefinger as he frowned at me, “you behave yourself!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"With those words, he released me—which I was glad of, for his hand","Great Expectations"
"smelt of scented soap—and went his way downstairs. I wondered whether","Great Expectations"
"he could be a doctor; but no, I thought; he couldn’t be a doctor, or he","Great Expectations"
"would have a quieter and more persuasive manner. There was not much","Great Expectations"
"time to consider the subject, for we were soon in Miss Havisham’s room,","Great Expectations"
"where she and everything else were just as I had left them. Estella","Great Expectations"
"left me standing near the door, and I stood there until Miss Havisham","Great Expectations"
"cast her eyes upon me from the dressing-table.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“So!” she said, without being startled or surprised: “the days have","Great Expectations"
"worn away, have they?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, ma’am. To-day is—”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“There, there, there!” with the impatient movement of her fingers. “I","Great Expectations"
"don’t want to know. Are you ready to play?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I was obliged to answer in some confusion, “I don’t think I am, ma’am.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Not at cards again?” she demanded, with a searching look.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, ma’am; I could do that, if I was wanted.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Since this house strikes you old and grave, boy,” said Miss Havisham,","Great Expectations"
"impatiently, “and you are unwilling to play, are you willing to work?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I could answer this inquiry with a better heart than I had been able to","Great Expectations"
"find for the other question, and I said I was quite willing.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Then go into that opposite room,” said she, pointing at the door","Great Expectations"
"behind me with her withered hand, “and wait there till I come.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I crossed the staircase landing, and entered the room she indicated.","Great Expectations"
"From that room, too, the daylight was completely excluded, and it had","Great Expectations"
"an airless smell that was oppressive. A fire had been lately kindled in","Great Expectations"
"the damp old-fashioned grate, and it was more disposed to go out than","Great Expectations"
"to burn up, and the reluctant smoke which hung in the room seemed","Great Expectations"
"colder than the clearer air,—like our own marsh mist. Certain wintry","Great Expectations"
"branches of candles on the high chimney-piece faintly lighted the","Great Expectations"
"chamber; or it would be more expressive to say, faintly troubled its","Great Expectations"
"darkness. It was spacious, and I dare say had once been handsome, but","Great Expectations"
"every discernible thing in it was covered with dust and mould, and","Great Expectations"
"dropping to pieces. The most prominent object was a long table with a","Great Expectations"
"tablecloth spread on it, as if a feast had been in preparation when the","Great Expectations"
"house and the clocks all stopped together. An epergne or centre-piece","Great Expectations"
"of some kind was in the middle of this cloth; it was so heavily","Great Expectations"
"overhung with cobwebs that its form was quite undistinguishable; and,","Great Expectations"
"as I looked along the yellow expanse out of which I remember its","Great Expectations"
"seeming to grow, like a black fungus, I saw speckle-legged spiders with","Great Expectations"
"blotchy bodies running home to it, and running out from it, as if some","Great Expectations"
"circumstances of the greatest public importance had just transpired in","Great Expectations"
"the spider community.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I heard the mice too, rattling behind the panels, as if the same","Great Expectations"
"occurrence were important to their interests. But the black beetles","Great Expectations"
"took no notice of the agitation, and groped about the hearth in a","Great Expectations"
"ponderous elderly way, as if they were short-sighted and hard of","Great Expectations"
"hearing, and not on terms with one another.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"These crawling things had fascinated my attention, and I was watching","Great Expectations"
"them from a distance, when Miss Havisham laid a hand upon my shoulder.","Great Expectations"
"In her other hand she had a crutch-headed stick on which she leaned,","Great Expectations"
"and she looked like the Witch of the place.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“This,” said she, pointing to the long table with her stick, “is where","Great Expectations"
"I will be laid when I am dead. They shall come and look at me here.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"With some vague misgiving that she might get upon the table then and","Great Expectations"
"there and die at once, the complete realisation of the ghastly waxwork","Great Expectations"
"at the Fair, I shrank under her touch.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What do you think that is?” she asked me, again pointing with her","Great Expectations"
"stick; “that, where those cobwebs are?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I can’t guess what it is, ma’am.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It’s a great cake. A bride-cake. Mine!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"She looked all round the room in a glaring manner, and then said,","Great Expectations"
"leaning on me while her hand twitched my shoulder, “Come, come, come!","Great Expectations"
"Walk me, walk me!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I made out from this, that the work I had to do, was to walk Miss","Great Expectations"
"Havisham round and round the room. Accordingly, I started at once, and","Great Expectations"
"she leaned upon my shoulder, and we went away at a pace that might have","Great Expectations"
"been an imitation (founded on my first impulse under that roof) of Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Pumblechook’s chaise-cart.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"She was not physically strong, and after a little time said, “Slower!”","Great Expectations"
"Still, we went at an impatient fitful speed, and as we went, she","Great Expectations"
"twitched the hand upon my shoulder, and worked her mouth, and led me to","Great Expectations"
"believe that we were going fast because her thoughts went fast. After a","Great Expectations"
"while she said, “Call Estella!” so I went out on the landing and roared","Great Expectations"
"that name as I had done on the previous occasion. When her light","Great Expectations"
"appeared, I returned to Miss Havisham, and we started away again round","Great Expectations"
"and round the room.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"If only Estella had come to be a spectator of our proceedings, I should","Great Expectations"
"have felt sufficiently discontented; but as she brought with her the","Great Expectations"
"three ladies and the gentleman whom I had seen below, I didn’t know","Great Expectations"
"what to do. In my politeness, I would have stopped; but Miss Havisham","Great Expectations"
"twitched my shoulder, and we posted on,—with a shame-faced","Great Expectations"
"consciousness on my part that they would think it was all my doing.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Dear Miss Havisham,” said Miss Sarah Pocket. “How well you look!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I do not,” returned Miss Havisham. “I am yellow skin and bone.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Camilla brightened when Miss Pocket met with this rebuff; and she","Great Expectations"
"murmured, as she plaintively contemplated Miss Havisham, “Poor dear","Great Expectations"
"soul! Certainly not to be expected to look well, poor thing. The idea!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And how are _you_?” said Miss Havisham to Camilla. As we were close to","Great Expectations"
"Camilla then, I would have stopped as a matter of course, only Miss","Great Expectations"
"Havisham wouldn’t stop. We swept on, and I felt that I was highly","Great Expectations"
"obnoxious to Camilla.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Thank you, Miss Havisham,” she returned, “I am as well as can be","Great Expectations"
"expected.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Why, what’s the matter with you?” asked Miss Havisham, with exceeding","Great Expectations"
"sharpness.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Nothing worth mentioning,” replied Camilla. “I don’t wish to make a","Great Expectations"
"display of my feelings, but I have habitually thought of you more in","Great Expectations"
"the night than I am quite equal to.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Then don’t think of me,” retorted Miss Havisham.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Very easily said!” remarked Camilla, amiably repressing a sob, while a","Great Expectations"
"hitch came into her upper lip, and her tears overflowed. “Raymond is a","Great Expectations"
"witness what ginger and sal volatile I am obliged to take in the night.","Great Expectations"
"Raymond is a witness what nervous jerkings I have in my legs. Chokings","Great Expectations"
"and nervous jerkings, however, are nothing new to me when I think with","Great Expectations"
"anxiety of those I love. If I could be less affectionate and sensitive,","Great Expectations"
"I should have a better digestion and an iron set of nerves. I am sure I","Great Expectations"
"wish it could be so. But as to not thinking of you in the night—The","Great Expectations"
"idea!” Here, a burst of tears.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The Raymond referred to, I understood to be the gentleman present, and","Great Expectations"
"him I understood to be Mr. Camilla. He came to the rescue at this","Great Expectations"
"point, and said in a consolatory and complimentary voice, “Camilla, my","Great Expectations"
"dear, it is well known that your family feelings are gradually","Great Expectations"
"undermining you to the extent of making one of your legs shorter than","Great Expectations"
"the other.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I am not aware,” observed the grave lady whose voice I had heard but","Great Expectations"
"once, “that to think of any person is to make a great claim upon that","Great Expectations"
"person, my dear.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Miss Sarah Pocket, whom I now saw to be a little dry, brown, corrugated","Great Expectations"
"old woman, with a small face that might have been made of","Great Expectations"
"walnut-shells, and a large mouth like a cat’s without the whiskers,","Great Expectations"
"supported this position by saying, “No, indeed, my dear. Hem!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Thinking is easy enough,” said the grave lady.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What is easier, you know?” assented Miss Sarah Pocket.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Oh, yes, yes!” cried Camilla, whose fermenting feelings appeared to","Great Expectations"
"rise from her legs to her bosom. “It’s all very true! It’s a weakness","Great Expectations"
"to be so affectionate, but I can’t help it. No doubt my health would be","Great Expectations"
"much better if it was otherwise, still I wouldn’t change my disposition","Great Expectations"
"if I could. It’s the cause of much suffering, but it’s a consolation to","Great Expectations"
"know I posses it, when I wake up in the night.” Here another burst of","Great Expectations"
"feeling.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Miss Havisham and I had never stopped all this time, but kept going","Great Expectations"
"round and round the room; now brushing against the skirts of the","Great Expectations"
"visitors, now giving them the whole length of the dismal chamber.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“There’s Matthew!” said Camilla. “Never mixing with any natural ties,","Great Expectations"
"never coming here to see how Miss Havisham is! I have taken to the sofa","Great Expectations"
"with my staylace cut, and have lain there hours insensible, with my","Great Expectations"
"head over the side, and my hair all down, and my feet I don’t know","Great Expectations"
"where—”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"(“Much higher than your head, my love,” said Mr. Camilla.)","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I have gone off into that state, hours and hours, on account of","Great Expectations"
"Matthew’s strange and inexplicable conduct, and nobody has thanked me.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Really I must say I should think not!” interposed the grave lady.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You see, my dear,” added Miss Sarah Pocket (a blandly vicious","Great Expectations"
"personage), “the question to put to yourself is, who did you expect to","Great Expectations"
"thank you, my love?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Without expecting any thanks, or anything of the sort,” resumed","Great Expectations"
"Camilla, “I have remained in that state, hours and hours, and Raymond","Great Expectations"
"is a witness of the extent to which I have choked, and what the total","Great Expectations"
"inefficacy of ginger has been, and I have been heard at the piano-forte","Great Expectations"
"tuner’s across the street, where the poor mistaken children have even","Great Expectations"
"supposed it to be pigeons cooing at a distance,—and now to be told—”","Great Expectations"
"Here Camilla put her hand to her throat, and began to be quite chemical","Great Expectations"
"as to the formation of new combinations there.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"When this same Matthew was mentioned, Miss Havisham stopped me and","Great Expectations"
"herself, and stood looking at the speaker. This change had a great","Great Expectations"
"influence in bringing Camilla’s chemistry to a sudden end.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Matthew will come and see me at last,” said Miss Havisham, sternly,","Great Expectations"
"“when I am laid on that table. That will be his place,—there,” striking","Great Expectations"
"the table with her stick, “at my head! And yours will be there! And","Great Expectations"
"your husband’s there! And Sarah Pocket’s there! And Georgiana’s there!","Great Expectations"
"Now you all know where to take your stations when you come to feast","Great Expectations"
"upon me. And now go!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"At the mention of each name, she had struck the table with her stick in","Great Expectations"
"a new place. She now said, “Walk me, walk me!” and we went on again.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I suppose there’s nothing to be done,” exclaimed Camilla, “but comply","Great Expectations"
"and depart. It’s something to have seen the object of one’s love and","Great Expectations"
"duty for even so short a time. I shall think of it with a melancholy","Great Expectations"
"satisfaction when I wake up in the night. I wish Matthew could have","Great Expectations"
"that comfort, but he sets it at defiance. I am determined not to make a","Great Expectations"
"display of my feelings, but it’s very hard to be told one wants to","Great Expectations"
"feast on one’s relations,—as if one was a Giant,—and to be told to go.","Great Expectations"
"The bare idea!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Camilla interposing, as Mrs. Camilla laid her hand upon her heaving","Great Expectations"
"bosom, that lady assumed an unnatural fortitude of manner which I","Great Expectations"
"supposed to be expressive of an intention to drop and choke when out of","Great Expectations"
"view, and kissing her hand to Miss Havisham, was escorted forth. Sarah","Great Expectations"
"Pocket and Georgiana contended who should remain last; but Sarah was","Great Expectations"
"too knowing to be outdone, and ambled round Georgiana with that artful","Great Expectations"
"slipperiness that the latter was obliged to take precedence. Sarah","Great Expectations"
"Pocket then made her separate effect of departing with, “Bless you,","Great Expectations"
"Miss Havisham dear!” and with a smile of forgiving pity on her","Great Expectations"
"walnut-shell countenance for the weaknesses of the rest.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"While Estella was away lighting them down, Miss Havisham still walked","Great Expectations"
"with her hand on my shoulder, but more and more slowly. At last she","Great Expectations"
"stopped before the fire, and said, after muttering and looking at it","Great Expectations"
"some seconds,—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“This is my birthday, Pip.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I was going to wish her many happy returns, when she lifted her stick.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I don’t suffer it to be spoken of. I don’t suffer those who were here","Great Expectations"
"just now, or any one to speak of it. They come here on the day, but","Great Expectations"
"they dare not refer to it.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Of course _I_ made no further effort to refer to it.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“On this day of the year, long before you were born, this heap of","Great Expectations"
"decay,” stabbing with her crutched stick at the pile of cobwebs on the","Great Expectations"
"table, but not touching it, “was brought here. It and I have worn away","Great Expectations"
"together. The mice have gnawed at it, and sharper teeth than teeth of","Great Expectations"
"mice have gnawed at me.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"She held the head of her stick against her heart as she stood looking","Great Expectations"
"at the table; she in her once white dress, all yellow and withered; the","Great Expectations"
"once white cloth all yellow and withered; everything around in a state","Great Expectations"
"to crumble under a touch.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“When the ruin is complete,” said she, with a ghastly look, “and when","Great Expectations"
"they lay me dead, in my bride’s dress on the bride’s table,—which shall","Great Expectations"
"be done, and which will be the finished curse upon him,—so much the","Great Expectations"
"better if it is done on this day!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"She stood looking at the table as if she stood looking at her own","Great Expectations"
"figure lying there. I remained quiet. Estella returned, and she too","Great Expectations"
"remained quiet. It seemed to me that we continued thus for a long time.","Great Expectations"
"In the heavy air of the room, and the heavy darkness that brooded in","Great Expectations"
"its remoter corners, I even had an alarming fancy that Estella and I","Great Expectations"
"might presently begin to decay.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"At length, not coming out of her distraught state by degrees, but in an","Great Expectations"
"instant, Miss Havisham said, “Let me see you two play cards; why have","Great Expectations"
"you not begun?” With that, we returned to her room, and sat down as","Great Expectations"
"before; I was beggared, as before; and again, as before, Miss Havisham","Great Expectations"
"watched us all the time, directed my attention to Estella’s beauty, and","Great Expectations"
"made me notice it the more by trying her jewels on Estella’s breast and","Great Expectations"
"hair.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Estella, for her part, likewise treated me as before, except that she","Great Expectations"
"did not condescend to speak. When we had played some half-dozen games,","Great Expectations"
"a day was appointed for my return, and I was taken down into the yard","Great Expectations"
"to be fed in the former dog-like manner. There, too, I was again left","Great Expectations"
"to wander about as I liked.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It is not much to the purpose whether a gate in that garden wall which","Great Expectations"
"I had scrambled up to peep over on the last occasion was, on that last","Great Expectations"
"occasion, open or shut. Enough that I saw no gate then, and that I saw","Great Expectations"
"one now. As it stood open, and as I knew that Estella had let the","Great Expectations"
"visitors out,—for she had returned with the keys in her hand,—I","Great Expectations"
"strolled into the garden, and strolled all over it. It was quite a","Great Expectations"
"wilderness, and there were old melon-frames and cucumber-frames in it,","Great Expectations"
"which seemed in their decline to have produced a spontaneous growth of","Great Expectations"
"weak attempts at pieces of old hats and boots, with now and then a","Great Expectations"
"weedy offshoot into the likeness of a battered saucepan.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"When I had exhausted the garden and a greenhouse with nothing in it but","Great Expectations"
"a fallen-down grape-vine and some bottles, I found myself in the dismal","Great Expectations"
"corner upon which I had looked out of the window. Never questioning for","Great Expectations"
"a moment that the house was now empty, I looked in at another window,","Great Expectations"
"and found myself, to my great surprise, exchanging a broad stare with a","Great Expectations"
"pale young gentleman with red eyelids and light hair.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"This pale young gentleman quickly disappeared, and reappeared beside","Great Expectations"
"me. He had been at his books when I had found myself staring at him,","Great Expectations"
"and I now saw that he was inky.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Halloa!” said he, “young fellow!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Halloa being a general observation which I had usually observed to be","Great Expectations"
"best answered by itself, _I_ said, “Halloa!” politely omitting young","Great Expectations"
"fellow.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Who let _you_ in?” said he.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Miss Estella.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Who gave you leave to prowl about?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Miss Estella.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Come and fight,” said the pale young gentleman.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"What could I do but follow him? I have often asked myself the question","Great Expectations"
"since; but what else could I do? His manner was so final, and I was so","Great Expectations"
"astonished, that I followed where he led, as if I had been under a","Great Expectations"
"spell.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Stop a minute, though,” he said, wheeling round before we had gone","Great Expectations"
"many paces. “I ought to give you a reason for fighting, too. There it","Great Expectations"
"is!” In a most irritating manner he instantly slapped his hands against","Great Expectations"
"one another, daintily flung one of his legs up behind him, pulled my","Great Expectations"
"hair, slapped his hands again, dipped his head, and butted it into my","Great Expectations"
"stomach.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The bull-like proceeding last mentioned, besides that it was","Great Expectations"
"unquestionably to be regarded in the light of a liberty, was","Great Expectations"
"particularly disagreeable just after bread and meat. I therefore hit","Great Expectations"
"out at him and was going to hit out again, when he said, “Aha! Would","Great Expectations"
"you?” and began dancing backwards and forwards in a manner quite","Great Expectations"
"unparalleled within my limited experience.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Laws of the game!” said he. Here, he skipped from his left leg on to","Great Expectations"
"his right. “Regular rules!” Here, he skipped from his right leg on to","Great Expectations"
"his left. “Come to the ground, and go through the preliminaries!” Here,","Great Expectations"
"he dodged backwards and forwards, and did all sorts of things while I","Great Expectations"
"looked helplessly at him.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I was secretly afraid of him when I saw him so dexterous; but I felt","Great Expectations"
"morally and physically convinced that his light head of hair could have","Great Expectations"
"had no business in the pit of my stomach, and that I had a right to","Great Expectations"
"consider it irrelevant when so obtruded on my attention. Therefore, I","Great Expectations"
"followed him without a word, to a retired nook of the garden, formed by","Great Expectations"
"the junction of two walls and screened by some rubbish. On his asking","Great Expectations"
"me if I was satisfied with the ground, and on my replying Yes, he","Great Expectations"
"begged my leave to absent himself for a moment, and quickly returned","Great Expectations"
"with a bottle of water and a sponge dipped in vinegar. “Available for","Great Expectations"
"both,” he said, placing these against the wall. And then fell to","Great Expectations"
"pulling off, not only his jacket and waistcoat, but his shirt too, in a","Great Expectations"
"manner at once light-hearted, business-like, and bloodthirsty.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Although he did not look very healthy,—having pimples on his face, and","Great Expectations"
"a breaking out at his mouth,—these dreadful preparations quite appalled","Great Expectations"
"me. I judged him to be about my own age, but he was much taller, and he","Great Expectations"
"had a way of spinning himself about that was full of appearance. For","Great Expectations"
"the rest, he was a young gentleman in a grey suit (when not denuded for","Great Expectations"
"battle), with his elbows, knees, wrists, and heels considerably in","Great Expectations"
"advance of the rest of him as to development.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"My heart failed me when I saw him squaring at me with every","Great Expectations"
"demonstration of mechanical nicety, and eyeing my anatomy as if he were","Great Expectations"
"minutely choosing his bone. I never have been so surprised in my life,","Great Expectations"
"as I was when I let out the first blow, and saw him lying on his back,","Great Expectations"
"looking up at me with a bloody nose and his face exceedingly","Great Expectations"
"fore-shortened.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"But, he was on his feet directly, and after sponging himself with a","Great Expectations"
"great show of dexterity began squaring again. The second greatest","Great Expectations"
"surprise I have ever had in my life was seeing him on his back again,","Great Expectations"
"looking up at me out of a black eye.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"His spirit inspired me with great respect. He seemed to have no","Great Expectations"
"strength, and he never once hit me hard, and he was always knocked","Great Expectations"
"down; but he would be up again in a moment, sponging himself or","Great Expectations"
"drinking out of the water-bottle, with the greatest satisfaction in","Great Expectations"
"seconding himself according to form, and then came at me with an air","Great Expectations"
"and a show that made me believe he really was going to do for me at","Great Expectations"
"last. He got heavily bruised, for I am sorry to record that the more I","Great Expectations"
"hit him, the harder I hit him; but he came up again and again and","Great Expectations"
"again, until at last he got a bad fall with the back of his head","Great Expectations"
"against the wall. Even after that crisis in our affairs, he got up and","Great Expectations"
"turned round and round confusedly a few times, not knowing where I was;","Great Expectations"
"but finally went on his knees to his sponge and threw it up: at the","Great Expectations"
"same time panting out, “That means you have won.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He seemed so brave and innocent, that although I had not proposed the","Great Expectations"
"contest, I felt but a gloomy satisfaction in my victory. Indeed, I go","Great Expectations"
"so far as to hope that I regarded myself while dressing as a species of","Great Expectations"
"savage young wolf or other wild beast. However, I got dressed, darkly","Great Expectations"
"wiping my sanguinary face at intervals, and I said, “Can I help you?”","Great Expectations"
"and he said “No thankee,” and I said “Good afternoon,” and _he_ said","Great Expectations"
"“Same to you.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"When I got into the courtyard, I found Estella waiting with the keys.","Great Expectations"
"But she neither asked me where I had been, nor why I had kept her","Great Expectations"
"waiting; and there was a bright flush upon her face, as though","Great Expectations"
"something had happened to delight her. Instead of going straight to the","Great Expectations"
"gate, too, she stepped back into the passage, and beckoned me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Come here! You may kiss me, if you like.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I kissed her cheek as she turned it to me. I think I would have gone","Great Expectations"
"through a great deal to kiss her cheek. But I felt that the kiss was","Great Expectations"
"given to the coarse common boy as a piece of money might have been, and","Great Expectations"
"that it was worth nothing.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"What with the birthday visitors, and what with the cards, and what with","Great Expectations"
"the fight, my stay had lasted so long, that when I neared home the","Great Expectations"
"light on the spit of sand off the point on the marshes was gleaming","Great Expectations"
"against a black night-sky, and Joe’s furnace was flinging a path of","Great Expectations"
"fire across the road.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"

"","Great Expectations"
"Chapter XII.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"My mind grew very uneasy on the subject of the pale young gentleman.","Great Expectations"
"The more I thought of the fight, and recalled the pale young gentleman","Great Expectations"
"on his back in various stages of puffy and incrimsoned countenance, the","Great Expectations"
"more certain it appeared that something would be done to me. I felt","Great Expectations"
"that the pale young gentleman’s blood was on my head, and that the Law","Great Expectations"
"would avenge it. Without having any definite idea of the penalties I","Great Expectations"
"had incurred, it was clear to me that village boys could not go","Great Expectations"
"stalking about the country, ravaging the houses of gentlefolks and","Great Expectations"
"pitching into the studious youth of England, without laying themselves","Great Expectations"
"open to severe punishment. For some days, I even kept close at home,","Great Expectations"
"and looked out at the kitchen door with the greatest caution and","Great Expectations"
"trepidation before going on an errand, lest the officers of the County","Great Expectations"
"Jail should pounce upon me. The pale young gentleman’s nose had stained","Great Expectations"
"my trousers, and I tried to wash out that evidence of my guilt in the","Great Expectations"
"dead of night. I had cut my knuckles against the pale young gentleman’s","Great Expectations"
"teeth, and I twisted my imagination into a thousand tangles, as I","Great Expectations"
"devised incredible ways of accounting for that damnatory circumstance","Great Expectations"
"when I should be haled before the Judges.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"When the day came round for my return to the scene of the deed of","Great Expectations"
"violence, my terrors reached their height. Whether myrmidons of","Great Expectations"
"Justice, especially sent down from London, would be lying in ambush","Great Expectations"
"behind the gate;—whether Miss Havisham, preferring to take personal","Great Expectations"
"vengeance for an outrage done to her house, might rise in those","Great Expectations"
"grave-clothes of hers, draw a pistol, and shoot me dead:—whether","Great Expectations"
"suborned boys—a numerous band of mercenaries—might be engaged to fall","Great Expectations"
"upon me in the brewery, and cuff me until I was no more;—it was high","Great Expectations"
"testimony to my confidence in the spirit of the pale young gentleman,","Great Expectations"
"that I never imagined _him_ accessory to these retaliations; they","Great Expectations"
"always came into my mind as the acts of injudicious relatives of his,","Great Expectations"
"goaded on by the state of his visage and an indignant sympathy with the","Great Expectations"
"family features.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"However, go to Miss Havisham’s I must, and go I did. And behold!","Great Expectations"
"nothing came of the late struggle. It was not alluded to in any way,","Great Expectations"
"and no pale young gentleman was to be discovered on the premises. I","Great Expectations"
"found the same gate open, and I explored the garden, and even looked in","Great Expectations"
"at the windows of the detached house; but my view was suddenly stopped","Great Expectations"
"by the closed shutters within, and all was lifeless. Only in the corner","Great Expectations"
"where the combat had taken place could I detect any evidence of the","Great Expectations"
"young gentleman’s existence. There were traces of his gore in that","Great Expectations"
"spot, and I covered them with garden-mould from the eye of man.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"On the broad landing between Miss Havisham’s own room and that other","Great Expectations"
"room in which the long table was laid out, I saw a garden-chair,—a","Great Expectations"
"light chair on wheels, that you pushed from behind. It had been placed","Great Expectations"
"there since my last visit, and I entered, that same day, on a regular","Great Expectations"
"occupation of pushing Miss Havisham in this chair (when she was tired","Great Expectations"
"of walking with her hand upon my shoulder) round her own room, and","Great Expectations"
"across the landing, and round the other room. Over and over and over","Great Expectations"
"again, we would make these journeys, and sometimes they would last as","Great Expectations"
"long as three hours at a stretch. I insensibly fall into a general","Great Expectations"
"mention of these journeys as numerous, because it was at once settled","Great Expectations"
"that I should return every alternate day at noon for these purposes,","Great Expectations"
"and because I am now going to sum up a period of at least eight or ten","Great Expectations"
"months.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As we began to be more used to one another, Miss Havisham talked more","Great Expectations"
"to me, and asked me such questions as what had I learnt and what was I","Great Expectations"
"going to be? I told her I was going to be apprenticed to Joe, I","Great Expectations"
"believed; and I enlarged upon my knowing nothing and wanting to know","Great Expectations"
"everything, in the hope that she might offer some help towards that","Great Expectations"
"desirable end. But she did not; on the contrary, she seemed to prefer","Great Expectations"
"my being ignorant. Neither did she ever give me any money,—or anything","Great Expectations"
"but my daily dinner,—nor ever stipulate that I should be paid for my","Great Expectations"
"services.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Estella was always about, and always let me in and out, but never told","Great Expectations"
"me I might kiss her again. Sometimes, she would coldly tolerate me;","Great Expectations"
"sometimes, she would condescend to me; sometimes, she would be quite","Great Expectations"
"familiar with me; sometimes, she would tell me energetically that she","Great Expectations"
"hated me. Miss Havisham would often ask me in a whisper, or when we","Great Expectations"
"were alone, “Does she grow prettier and prettier, Pip?” And when I said","Great Expectations"
"yes (for indeed she did), would seem to enjoy it greedily. Also, when","Great Expectations"
"we played at cards Miss Havisham would look on, with a miserly relish","Great Expectations"
"of Estella’s moods, whatever they were. And sometimes, when her moods","Great Expectations"
"were so many and so contradictory of one another that I was puzzled","Great Expectations"
"what to say or do, Miss Havisham would embrace her with lavish","Great Expectations"
"fondness, murmuring something in her ear that sounded like “Break their","Great Expectations"
"hearts my pride and hope, break their hearts and have no mercy!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"There was a song Joe used to hum fragments of at the forge, of which","Great Expectations"
"the burden was Old Clem. This was not a very ceremonious way of","Great Expectations"
"rendering homage to a patron saint, but I believe Old Clem stood in","Great Expectations"
"that relation towards smiths. It was a song that imitated the measure","Great Expectations"
"of beating upon iron, and was a mere lyrical excuse for the","Great Expectations"
"introduction of Old Clem’s respected name. Thus, you were to hammer","Great Expectations"
"boys round—Old Clem! With a thump and a sound—Old Clem! Beat it out,","Great Expectations"
"beat it out—Old Clem! With a clink for the stout—Old Clem! Blow the","Great Expectations"
"fire, blow the fire—Old Clem! Roaring dryer, soaring higher—Old Clem!","Great Expectations"
"One day soon after the appearance of the chair, Miss Havisham suddenly","Great Expectations"
"saying to me, with the impatient movement of her fingers, “There,","Great Expectations"
"there, there! Sing!” I was surprised into crooning this ditty as I","Great Expectations"
"pushed her over the floor. It happened so to catch her fancy that she","Great Expectations"
"took it up in a low brooding voice as if she were singing in her sleep.","Great Expectations"
"After that, it became customary with us to have it as we moved about,","Great Expectations"
"and Estella would often join in; though the whole strain was so","Great Expectations"
"subdued, even when there were three of us, that it made less noise in","Great Expectations"
"the grim old house than the lightest breath of wind.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"What could I become with these surroundings? How could my character","Great Expectations"
"fail to be influenced by them? Is it to be wondered at if my thoughts","Great Expectations"
"were dazed, as my eyes were, when I came out into the natural light","Great Expectations"
"from the misty yellow rooms?","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Perhaps I might have told Joe about the pale young gentleman, if I had","Great Expectations"
"not previously been betrayed into those enormous inventions to which I","Great Expectations"
"had confessed. Under the circumstances, I felt that Joe could hardly","Great Expectations"
"fail to discern in the pale young gentleman, an appropriate passenger","Great Expectations"
"to be put into the black velvet coach; therefore, I said nothing of","Great Expectations"
"him. Besides, that shrinking from having Miss Havisham and Estella","Great Expectations"
"discussed, which had come upon me in the beginning, grew much more","Great Expectations"
"potent as time went on. I reposed complete confidence in no one but","Great Expectations"
"Biddy; but I told poor Biddy everything. Why it came natural to me to","Great Expectations"
"do so, and why Biddy had a deep concern in everything I told her, I did","Great Expectations"
"not know then, though I think I know now.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Meanwhile, councils went on in the kitchen at home, fraught with almost","Great Expectations"
"insupportable aggravation to my exasperated spirit. That ass,","Great Expectations"
"Pumblechook, used often to come over of a night for the purpose of","Great Expectations"
"discussing my prospects with my sister; and I really do believe (to","Great Expectations"
"this hour with less penitence than I ought to feel), that if these","Great Expectations"
"hands could have taken a linchpin out of his chaise-cart, they would","Great Expectations"
"have done it. The miserable man was a man of that confined stolidity of","Great Expectations"
"mind, that he could not discuss my prospects without having me before","Great Expectations"
"him,—as it were, to operate upon,—and he would drag me up from my stool","Great Expectations"
"(usually by the collar) where I was quiet in a corner, and, putting me","Great Expectations"
"before the fire as if I were going to be cooked, would begin by saying,","Great Expectations"
"“Now, Mum, here is this boy! Here is this boy which you brought up by","Great Expectations"
"hand. Hold up your head, boy, and be forever grateful unto them which","Great Expectations"
"so did do. Now, Mum, with respections to this boy!” And then he would","Great Expectations"
"rumple my hair the wrong way,—which from my earliest remembrance, as","Great Expectations"
"already hinted, I have in my soul denied the right of any","Great Expectations"
"fellow-creature to do,—and would hold me before him by the sleeve,—a","Great Expectations"
"spectacle of imbecility only to be equalled by himself.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Then, he and my sister would pair off in such nonsensical speculations","Great Expectations"
"about Miss Havisham, and about what she would do with me and for me,","Great Expectations"
"that I used to want—quite painfully—to burst into spiteful tears, fly","Great Expectations"
"at Pumblechook, and pummel him all over. In these dialogues, my sister","Great Expectations"
"spoke to me as if she were morally wrenching one of my teeth out at","Great Expectations"
"every reference; while Pumblechook himself, self-constituted my patron,","Great Expectations"
"would sit supervising me with a depreciatory eye, like the architect of","Great Expectations"
"my fortunes who thought himself engaged on a very unremunerative job.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"In these discussions, Joe bore no part. But he was often talked at,","Great Expectations"
"while they were in progress, by reason of Mrs. Joe’s perceiving that he","Great Expectations"
"was not favourable to my being taken from the forge. I was fully old","Great Expectations"
"enough now to be apprenticed to Joe; and when Joe sat with the poker on","Great Expectations"
"his knees thoughtfully raking out the ashes between the lower bars, my","Great Expectations"
"sister would so distinctly construe that innocent action into","Great Expectations"
"opposition on his part, that she would dive at him, take the poker out","Great Expectations"
"of his hands, shake him, and put it away. There was a most irritating","Great Expectations"
"end to every one of these debates. All in a moment, with nothing to","Great Expectations"
"lead up to it, my sister would stop herself in a yawn, and catching","Great Expectations"
"sight of me as it were incidentally, would swoop upon me with, “Come!","Great Expectations"
"there’s enough of _you_! _You_ get along to bed; _you_’ve given trouble","Great Expectations"
"enough for one night, I hope!” As if I had besought them as a favour to","Great Expectations"
"bother my life out.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We went on in this way for a long time, and it seemed likely that we","Great Expectations"
"should continue to go on in this way for a long time, when one day Miss","Great Expectations"
"Havisham stopped short as she and I were walking, she leaning on my","Great Expectations"
"shoulder; and said with some displeasure,—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You are growing tall, Pip!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I thought it best to hint, through the medium of a meditative look,","Great Expectations"
"that this might be occasioned by circumstances over which I had no","Great Expectations"
"control.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"She said no more at the time; but she presently stopped and looked at","Great Expectations"
"me again; and presently again; and after that, looked frowning and","Great Expectations"
"moody. On the next day of my attendance, when our usual exercise was","Great Expectations"
"over, and I had landed her at her dressing-table, she stayed me with a","Great Expectations"
"movement of her impatient fingers:—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Tell me the name again of that blacksmith of yours.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Joe Gargery, ma’am.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Meaning the master you were to be apprenticed to?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, Miss Havisham.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You had better be apprenticed at once. Would Gargery come here with","Great Expectations"
"you, and bring your indentures, do you think?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I signified that I had no doubt he would take it as an honour to be","Great Expectations"
"asked.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Then let him come.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“At any particular time, Miss Havisham?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“There, there! I know nothing about times. Let him come soon, and come","Great Expectations"
"along with you.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"When I got home at night, and delivered this message for Joe, my sister","Great Expectations"
"“went on the Rampage,” in a more alarming degree than at any previous","Great Expectations"
"period. She asked me and Joe whether we supposed she was door-mats","Great Expectations"
"under our feet, and how we dared to use her so, and what company we","Great Expectations"
"graciously thought she _was_ fit for? When she had exhausted a torrent","Great Expectations"
"of such inquiries, she threw a candlestick at Joe, burst into a loud","Great Expectations"
"sobbing, got out the dustpan,—which was always a very bad sign,—put on","Great Expectations"
"her coarse apron, and began cleaning up to a terrible extent. Not","Great Expectations"
"satisfied with a dry cleaning, she took to a pail and scrubbing-brush,","Great Expectations"
"and cleaned us out of house and home, so that we stood shivering in the","Great Expectations"
"back-yard. It was ten o’clock at night before we ventured to creep in","Great Expectations"
"again, and then she asked Joe why he hadn’t married a Negress Slave at","Great Expectations"
"once? Joe offered no answer, poor fellow, but stood feeling his whisker","Great Expectations"
"and looking dejectedly at me, as if he thought it really might have","Great Expectations"
"been a better speculation.","Great Expectations"

"","Great Expectations"
"Chapter XIII.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was a trial to my feelings, on the next day but one, to see Joe","Great Expectations"
"arraying himself in his Sunday clothes to accompany me to Miss","Great Expectations"
"Havisham’s. However, as he thought his court-suit necessary to the","Great Expectations"
"occasion, it was not for me to tell him that he looked far better in","Great Expectations"
"his working-dress; the rather, because I knew he made himself so","Great Expectations"
"dreadfully uncomfortable, entirely on my account, and that it was for","Great Expectations"
"me he pulled up his shirt-collar so very high behind, that it made the","Great Expectations"
"hair on the crown of his head stand up like a tuft of feathers.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"At breakfast-time my sister declared her intention of going to town","Great Expectations"
"with us, and being left at Uncle Pumblechook’s and called for “when we","Great Expectations"
"had done with our fine ladies”—a way of putting the case, from which","Great Expectations"
"Joe appeared inclined to augur the worst. The forge was shut up for the","Great Expectations"
"day, and Joe inscribed in chalk upon the door (as it was his custom to","Great Expectations"
"do on the very rare occasions when he was not at work) the monosyllable","Great Expectations"
"HOUT, accompanied by a sketch of an arrow supposed to be flying in the","Great Expectations"
"direction he had taken.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We walked to town, my sister leading the way in a very large beaver","Great Expectations"
"bonnet, and carrying a basket like the Great Seal of England in plaited","Great Expectations"
"Straw, a pair of pattens, a spare shawl, and an umbrella, though it was","Great Expectations"
"a fine bright day. I am not quite clear whether these articles were","Great Expectations"
"carried penitentially or ostentatiously; but I rather think they were","Great Expectations"
"displayed as articles of property,—much as Cleopatra or any other","Great Expectations"
"sovereign lady on the Rampage might exhibit her wealth in a pageant or","Great Expectations"
"procession.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"When we came to Pumblechook’s, my sister bounced in and left us. As it","Great Expectations"
"was almost noon, Joe and I held straight on to Miss Havisham’s house.","Great Expectations"
"Estella opened the gate as usual, and, the moment she appeared, Joe","Great Expectations"
"took his hat off and stood weighing it by the brim in both his hands;","Great Expectations"
"as if he had some urgent reason in his mind for being particular to","Great Expectations"
"half a quarter of an ounce.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Estella took no notice of either of us, but led us the way that I knew","Great Expectations"
"so well. I followed next to her, and Joe came last. When I looked back","Great Expectations"
"at Joe in the long passage, he was still weighing his hat with the","Great Expectations"
"greatest care, and was coming after us in long strides on the tips of","Great Expectations"
"his toes.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Estella told me we were both to go in, so I took Joe by the coat-cuff","Great Expectations"
"and conducted him into Miss Havisham’s presence. She was seated at her","Great Expectations"
"dressing-table, and looked round at us immediately.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Oh!” said she to Joe. “You are the husband of the sister of this boy?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I could hardly have imagined dear old Joe looking so unlike himself or","Great Expectations"
"so like some extraordinary bird; standing as he did speechless, with","Great Expectations"
"his tuft of feathers ruffled, and his mouth open as if he wanted a","Great Expectations"
"worm.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You are the husband,” repeated Miss Havisham, “of the sister of this","Great Expectations"
"boy?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was very aggravating; but, throughout the interview, Joe persisted","Great Expectations"
"in addressing Me instead of Miss Havisham.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Which I meantersay, Pip,” Joe now observed in a manner that was at","Great Expectations"
"once expressive of forcible argumentation, strict confidence, and great","Great Expectations"
"politeness, “as I hup and married your sister, and I were at the time","Great Expectations"
"what you might call (if you was anyways inclined) a single man.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well!” said Miss Havisham. “And you have reared the boy, with the","Great Expectations"
"intention of taking him for your apprentice; is that so, Mr. Gargery?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You know, Pip,” replied Joe, “as you and me were ever friends, and it","Great Expectations"
"were looked for’ard to betwixt us, as being calc’lated to lead to","Great Expectations"
"larks. Not but what, Pip, if you had ever made objections to the","Great Expectations"
"business,—such as its being open to black and sut, or such-like,—not","Great Expectations"
"but what they would have been attended to, don’t you see?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Has the boy,” said Miss Havisham, “ever made any objection? Does he","Great Expectations"
"like the trade?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Which it is well beknown to yourself, Pip,” returned Joe,","Great Expectations"
"strengthening his former mixture of argumentation, confidence, and","Great Expectations"
"politeness, “that it were the wish of your own hart.” (I saw the idea","Great Expectations"
"suddenly break upon him that he would adapt his epitaph to the","Great Expectations"
"occasion, before he went on to say) “And there weren’t no objection on","Great Expectations"
"your part, and Pip it were the great wish of your hart!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was quite in vain for me to endeavour to make him sensible that he","Great Expectations"
"ought to speak to Miss Havisham. The more I made faces and gestures to","Great Expectations"
"him to do it, the more confidential, argumentative, and polite, he","Great Expectations"
"persisted in being to Me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Have you brought his indentures with you?” asked Miss Havisham.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well, Pip, you know,” replied Joe, as if that were a little","Great Expectations"
"unreasonable, “you yourself see me put ’em in my ’at, and therefore you","Great Expectations"
"know as they are here.” With which he took them out, and gave them, not","Great Expectations"
"to Miss Havisham, but to me. I am afraid I was ashamed of the dear good","Great Expectations"
"fellow,—I _know_ I was ashamed of him,—when I saw that Estella stood at","Great Expectations"
"the back of Miss Havisham’s chair, and that her eyes laughed","Great Expectations"
"mischievously. I took the indentures out of his hand and gave them to","Great Expectations"
"Miss Havisham.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You expected,” said Miss Havisham, as she looked them over, “no","Great Expectations"
"premium with the boy?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Joe!” I remonstrated, for he made no reply at all. “Why don’t you","Great Expectations"
"answer—”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Pip,” returned Joe, cutting me short as if he were hurt, “which I","Great Expectations"
"meantersay that were not a question requiring a answer betwixt yourself","Great Expectations"
"and me, and which you know the answer to be full well No. You know it","Great Expectations"
"to be No, Pip, and wherefore should I say it?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Miss Havisham glanced at him as if she understood what he really was","Great Expectations"
"better than I had thought possible, seeing what he was there; and took","Great Expectations"
"up a little bag from the table beside her.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Pip has earned a premium here,” she said, “and here it is. There are","Great Expectations"
"five-and-twenty guineas in this bag. Give it to your master, Pip.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As if he were absolutely out of his mind with the wonder awakened in","Great Expectations"
"him by her strange figure and the strange room, Joe, even at this pass,","Great Expectations"
"persisted in addressing me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“This is wery liberal on your part, Pip,” said Joe, “and it is as such","Great Expectations"
"received and grateful welcome, though never looked for, far nor near,","Great Expectations"
"nor nowheres. And now, old chap,” said Joe, conveying to me a","Great Expectations"
"sensation, first of burning and then of freezing, for I felt as if that","Great Expectations"
"familiar expression were applied to Miss Havisham,—“and now, old chap,","Great Expectations"
"may we do our duty! May you and me do our duty, both on us, by one and","Great Expectations"
"another, and by them which your liberal present—have-conweyed—to be—for","Great Expectations"
"the satisfaction of mind-of—them as never—” here Joe showed that he","Great Expectations"
"felt he had fallen into frightful difficulties, until he triumphantly","Great Expectations"
"rescued himself with the words, “and from myself far be it!” These","Great Expectations"
"words had such a round and convincing sound for him that he said them","Great Expectations"
"twice.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Good-bye, Pip!” said Miss Havisham. “Let them out, Estella.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Am I to come again, Miss Havisham?” I asked.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No. Gargery is your master now. Gargery! One word!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Thus calling him back as I went out of the door, I heard her say to Joe","Great Expectations"
"in a distinct emphatic voice, “The boy has been a good boy here, and","Great Expectations"
"that is his reward. Of course, as an honest man, you will expect no","Great Expectations"
"other and no more.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"How Joe got out of the room, I have never been able to determine; but I","Great Expectations"
"know that when he did get out he was steadily proceeding upstairs","Great Expectations"
"instead of coming down, and was deaf to all remonstrances until I went","Great Expectations"
"after him and laid hold of him. In another minute we were outside the","Great Expectations"
"gate, and it was locked, and Estella was gone. When we stood in the","Great Expectations"
"daylight alone again, Joe backed up against a wall, and said to me,","Great Expectations"
"“Astonishing!” And there he remained so long saying, “Astonishing” at","Great Expectations"
"intervals, so often, that I began to think his senses were never coming","Great Expectations"
"back. At length he prolonged his remark into “Pip, I do assure _you_","Great Expectations"
"this is as-TON-ishing!” and so, by degrees, became conversational and","Great Expectations"
"able to walk away.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I have reason to think that Joe’s intellects were brightened by the","Great Expectations"
"encounter they had passed through, and that on our way to Pumblechook’s","Great Expectations"
"he invented a subtle and deep design. My reason is to be found in what","Great Expectations"
"took place in Mr. Pumblechook’s parlour: where, on our presenting","Great Expectations"
"ourselves, my sister sat in conference with that detested seedsman.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well?” cried my sister, addressing us both at once. “And what’s","Great Expectations"
"happened to _you_? I wonder you condescend to come back to such poor","Great Expectations"
"society as this, I am sure I do!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Miss Havisham,” said Joe, with a fixed look at me, like an effort of","Great Expectations"
"remembrance, “made it wery partick’ler that we should give her—were it","Great Expectations"
"compliments or respects, Pip?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Compliments,” I said.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Which that were my own belief,” answered Joe; “her compliments to Mrs.","Great Expectations"
"J. Gargery—”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Much good they’ll do me!” observed my sister; but rather gratified","Great Expectations"
"too.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And wishing,” pursued Joe, with another fixed look at me, like another","Great Expectations"
"effort of remembrance, “that the state of Miss Havisham’s elth were","Great Expectations"
"sitch as would have—allowed, were it, Pip?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Of her having the pleasure,” I added.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Of ladies’ company,” said Joe. And drew a long breath.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well!” cried my sister, with a mollified glance at Mr. Pumblechook.","Great Expectations"
"“She might have had the politeness to send that message at first, but","Great Expectations"
"it’s better late than never. And what did she give young Rantipole","Great Expectations"
"here?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“She giv’ him,” said Joe, “nothing.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mrs. Joe was going to break out, but Joe went on.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What she giv’,” said Joe, “she giv’ to his friends. ‘And by his","Great Expectations"
"friends,’ were her explanation, ‘I mean into the hands of his sister","Great Expectations"
"Mrs. J. Gargery.’ Them were her words; ‘Mrs. J. Gargery.’ She mayn’t","Great Expectations"
"have know’d,” added Joe, with an appearance of reflection, “whether it","Great Expectations"
"were Joe, or Jorge.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"My sister looked at Pumblechook: who smoothed the elbows of his wooden","Great Expectations"
"arm-chair, and nodded at her and at the fire, as if he had known all","Great Expectations"
"about it beforehand.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And how much have you got?” asked my sister, laughing. Positively","Great Expectations"
"laughing!","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What would present company say to ten pound?” demanded Joe.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“They’d say,” returned my sister, curtly, “pretty well. Not too much,","Great Expectations"
"but pretty well.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It’s more than that, then,” said Joe.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"That fearful Impostor, Pumblechook, immediately nodded, and said, as he","Great Expectations"
"rubbed the arms of his chair, “It’s more than that, Mum.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Why, you don’t mean to say—” began my sister.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes I do, Mum,” said Pumblechook; “but wait a bit. Go on, Joseph. Good","Great Expectations"
"in you! Go on!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What would present company say,” proceeded Joe, “to twenty pound?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Handsome would be the word,” returned my sister.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well, then,” said Joe, “It’s more than twenty pound.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"That abject hypocrite, Pumblechook, nodded again, and said, with a","Great Expectations"
"patronizing laugh, “It’s more than that, Mum. Good again! Follow her","Great Expectations"
"up, Joseph!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Then to make an end of it,” said Joe, delightedly handing the bag to","Great Expectations"
"my sister; “it’s five-and-twenty pound.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It’s five-and-twenty pound, Mum,” echoed that basest of swindlers,","Great Expectations"
"Pumblechook, rising to shake hands with her; “and it’s no more than","Great Expectations"
"your merits (as I said when my opinion was asked), and I wish you joy","Great Expectations"
"of the money!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"If the villain had stopped here, his case would have been sufficiently","Great Expectations"
"awful, but he blackened his guilt by proceeding to take me into","Great Expectations"
"custody, with a right of patronage that left all his former criminality","Great Expectations"
"far behind.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Now you see, Joseph and wife,” said Pumblechook, as he took me by the","Great Expectations"
"arm above the elbow, “I am one of them that always go right through","Great Expectations"
"with what they’ve begun. This boy must be bound, out of hand. That’s","Great Expectations"
"_my_ way. Bound out of hand.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Goodness knows, Uncle Pumblechook,” said my sister (grasping the","Great Expectations"
"money), “we’re deeply beholden to you.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Never mind me, Mum,” returned that diabolical cornchandler. “A","Great Expectations"
"pleasure’s a pleasure all the world over. But this boy, you know; we","Great Expectations"
"must have him bound. I said I’d see to it—to tell you the truth.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The Justices were sitting in the Town Hall near at hand, and we at once","Great Expectations"
"went over to have me bound apprentice to Joe in the Magisterial","Great Expectations"
"presence. I say we went over, but I was pushed over by Pumblechook,","Great Expectations"
"exactly as if I had that moment picked a pocket or fired a rick;","Great Expectations"
"indeed, it was the general impression in Court that I had been taken","Great Expectations"
"red-handed; for, as Pumblechook shoved me before him through the crowd,","Great Expectations"
"I heard some people say, “What’s he done?” and others, “He’s a young","Great Expectations"
"’un, too, but looks bad, don’t he?” One person of mild and benevolent","Great Expectations"
"aspect even gave me a tract ornamented with a woodcut of a malevolent","Great Expectations"
"young man fitted up with a perfect sausage-shop of fetters, and","Great Expectations"
"entitled TO BE READ IN MY CELL.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The Hall was a queer place, I thought, with higher pews in it than a","Great Expectations"
"church,—and with people hanging over the pews looking on,—and with","Great Expectations"
"mighty Justices (one with a powdered head) leaning back in chairs, with","Great Expectations"
"folded arms, or taking snuff, or going to sleep, or writing, or reading","Great Expectations"
"the newspapers,—and with some shining black portraits on the walls,","Great Expectations"
"which my unartistic eye regarded as a composition of hardbake and","Great Expectations"
"sticking-plaster. Here, in a corner my indentures were duly signed and","Great Expectations"
"attested, and I was “bound”; Mr. Pumblechook holding me all the while","Great Expectations"
"as if we had looked in on our way to the scaffold, to have those little","Great Expectations"
"preliminaries disposed of.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"When we had come out again, and had got rid of the boys who had been","Great Expectations"
"put into great spirits by the expectation of seeing me publicly","Great Expectations"
"tortured, and who were much disappointed to find that my friends were","Great Expectations"
"merely rallying round me, we went back to Pumblechook’s. And there my","Great Expectations"
"sister became so excited by the twenty-five guineas, that nothing would","Great Expectations"
"serve her but we must have a dinner out of that windfall at the Blue","Great Expectations"
"Boar, and that Pumblechook must go over in his chaise-cart, and bring","Great Expectations"
"the Hubbles and Mr. Wopsle.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was agreed to be done; and a most melancholy day I passed. For, it","Great Expectations"
"inscrutably appeared to stand to reason, in the minds of the whole","Great Expectations"
"company, that I was an excrescence on the entertainment. And to make it","Great Expectations"
"worse, they all asked me from time to time,—in short, whenever they had","Great Expectations"
"nothing else to do,—why I didn’t enjoy myself? And what could I","Great Expectations"
"possibly do then, but say I _was_ enjoying myself,—when I wasn’t!","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"However, they were grown up and had their own way, and they made the","Great Expectations"
"most of it. That swindling Pumblechook, exalted into the beneficent","Great Expectations"
"contriver of the whole occasion, actually took the top of the table;","Great Expectations"
"and, when he addressed them on the subject of my being bound, and had","Great Expectations"
"fiendishly congratulated them on my being liable to imprisonment if I","Great Expectations"
"played at cards, drank strong liquors, kept late hours or bad company,","Great Expectations"
"or indulged in other vagaries which the form of my indentures appeared","Great Expectations"
"to contemplate as next to inevitable, he placed me standing on a chair","Great Expectations"
"beside him to illustrate his remarks.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"My only other remembrances of the great festival are, That they","Great Expectations"
"wouldn’t let me go to sleep, but whenever they saw me dropping off,","Great Expectations"
"woke me up and told me to enjoy myself. That, rather late in the","Great Expectations"
"evening Mr. Wopsle gave us Collins’s ode, and threw his bloodstained","Great Expectations"
"sword in thunder down, with such effect, that a waiter came in and","Great Expectations"
"said, “The Commercials underneath sent up their compliments, and it","Great Expectations"
"wasn’t the Tumblers’ Arms.” That, they were all in excellent spirits on","Great Expectations"
"the road home, and sang, O Lady Fair! Mr. Wopsle taking the bass, and","Great Expectations"
"asserting with a tremendously strong voice (in reply to the inquisitive","Great Expectations"
"bore who leads that piece of music in a most impertinent manner, by","Great Expectations"
"wanting to know all about everybody’s private affairs) that _he_ was","Great Expectations"
"the man with his white locks flowing, and that he was upon the whole","Great Expectations"
"the weakest pilgrim going.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Finally, I remember that when I got into my little bedroom, I was truly","Great Expectations"
"wretched, and had a strong conviction on me that I should never like","Great Expectations"
"Joe’s trade. I had liked it once, but once was not now.","Great Expectations"

"Chapter XIV.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It is a most miserable thing to feel ashamed of home. There may be","Great Expectations"
"black ingratitude in the thing, and the punishment may be retributive","Great Expectations"
"and well deserved; but that it is a miserable thing, I can testify.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Home had never been a very pleasant place to me, because of my sister’s","Great Expectations"
"temper. But, Joe had sanctified it, and I had believed in it. I had","Great Expectations"
"believed in the best parlour as a most elegant saloon; I had believed","Great Expectations"
"in the front door, as a mysterious portal of the Temple of State whose","Great Expectations"
"solemn opening was attended with a sacrifice of roast fowls; I had","Great Expectations"
"believed in the kitchen as a chaste though not magnificent apartment; I","Great Expectations"
"had believed in the forge as the glowing road to manhood and","Great Expectations"
"independence. Within a single year all this was changed. Now it was all","Great Expectations"
"coarse and common, and I would not have had Miss Havisham and Estella","Great Expectations"
"see it on any account.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"How much of my ungracious condition of mind may have been my own fault,","Great Expectations"
"how much Miss Havisham’s, how much my sister’s, is now of no moment to","Great Expectations"
"me or to any one. The change was made in me; the thing was done. Well","Great Expectations"
"or ill done, excusably or inexcusably, it was done.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Once, it had seemed to me that when I should at last roll up my","Great Expectations"
"shirt-sleeves and go into the forge, Joe’s ’prentice, I should be","Great Expectations"
"distinguished and happy. Now the reality was in my hold, I only felt","Great Expectations"
"that I was dusty with the dust of small-coal, and that I had a weight","Great Expectations"
"upon my daily remembrance to which the anvil was a feather. There have","Great Expectations"
"been occasions in my later life (I suppose as in most lives) when I","Great Expectations"
"have felt for a time as if a thick curtain had fallen on all its","Great Expectations"
"interest and romance, to shut me out from anything save dull endurance","Great Expectations"
"any more. Never has that curtain dropped so heavy and blank, as when my","Great Expectations"
"way in life lay stretched out straight before me through the newly","Great Expectations"
"entered road of apprenticeship to Joe.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I remember that at a later period of my “time,” I used to stand about","Great Expectations"
"the churchyard on Sunday evenings when night was falling, comparing my","Great Expectations"
"own perspective with the windy marsh view, and making out some likeness","Great Expectations"
"between them by thinking how flat and low both were, and how on both","Great Expectations"
"there came an unknown way and a dark mist and then the sea. I was quite","Great Expectations"
"as dejected on the first working-day of my apprenticeship as in that","Great Expectations"
"after-time; but I am glad to know that I never breathed a murmur to Joe","Great Expectations"
"while my indentures lasted. It is about the only thing I _am_ glad to","Great Expectations"
"know of myself in that connection.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"For, though it includes what I proceed to add, all the merit of what I","Great Expectations"
"proceed to add was Joe’s. It was not because I was faithful, but","Great Expectations"
"because Joe was faithful, that I never ran away and went for a soldier","Great Expectations"
"or a sailor. It was not because I had a strong sense of the virtue of","Great Expectations"
"industry, but because Joe had a strong sense of the virtue of industry,","Great Expectations"
"that I worked with tolerable zeal against the grain. It is not possible","Great Expectations"
"to know how far the influence of any amiable honest-hearted duty-doing","Great Expectations"
"man flies out into the world; but it is very possible to know how it","Great Expectations"
"has touched one’s self in going by, and I know right well that any good","Great Expectations"
"that intermixed itself with my apprenticeship came of plain contented","Great Expectations"
"Joe, and not of restlessly aspiring discontented me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"What I wanted, who can say? How can _I_ say, when I never knew? What I","Great Expectations"
"dreaded was, that in some unlucky hour I, being at my grimiest and","Great Expectations"
"commonest, should lift up my eyes and see Estella looking in at one of","Great Expectations"
"the wooden windows of the forge. I was haunted by the fear that she","Great Expectations"
"would, sooner or later, find me out, with a black face and hands, doing","Great Expectations"
"the coarsest part of my work, and would exult over me and despise me.","Great Expectations"
"Often after dark, when I was pulling the bellows for Joe, and we were","Great Expectations"
"singing Old Clem, and when the thought how we used to sing it at Miss","Great Expectations"
"Havisham’s would seem to show me Estella’s face in the fire, with her","Great Expectations"
"pretty hair fluttering in the wind and her eyes scorning me,—often at","Great Expectations"
"such a time I would look towards those panels of black night in the","Great Expectations"
"wall which the wooden windows then were, and would fancy that I saw her","Great Expectations"
"just drawing her face away, and would believe that she had come at","Great Expectations"
"last.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"After that, when we went in to supper, the place and the meal would","Great Expectations"
"have a more homely look than ever, and I would feel more ashamed of","Great Expectations"
"home than ever, in my own ungracious breast.","Great Expectations"

"Chapter XV.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As I was getting too big for Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt’s room, my","Great Expectations"
"education under that preposterous female terminated. Not, however,","Great Expectations"
"until Biddy had imparted to me everything she knew, from the little","Great Expectations"
"catalogue of prices, to a comic song she had once bought for a","Great Expectations"
"half-penny. Although the only coherent part of the latter piece of","Great Expectations"
"literature were the opening lines,","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"     When I went to Lunnon town sirs,","Great Expectations"
"     Too rul loo rul","Great Expectations"
"     Too rul loo rul","Great Expectations"
"     Wasn’t I done very brown sirs?","Great Expectations"
"     Too rul loo rul","Great Expectations"
"     Too rul loo rul","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"—still, in my desire to be wiser, I got this composition by heart with","Great Expectations"
"the utmost gravity; nor do I recollect that I questioned its merit,","Great Expectations"
"except that I thought (as I still do) the amount of Too rul somewhat in","Great Expectations"
"excess of the poetry. In my hunger for information, I made proposals to","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Wopsle to bestow some intellectual crumbs upon me, with which he","Great Expectations"
"kindly complied. As it turned out, however, that he only wanted me for","Great Expectations"
"a dramatic lay-figure, to be contradicted and embraced and wept over","Great Expectations"
"and bullied and clutched and stabbed and knocked about in a variety of","Great Expectations"
"ways, I soon declined that course of instruction; though not until Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Wopsle in his poetic fury had severely mauled me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Whatever I acquired, I tried to impart to Joe. This statement sounds so","Great Expectations"
"well, that I cannot in my conscience let it pass unexplained. I wanted","Great Expectations"
"to make Joe less ignorant and common, that he might be worthier of my","Great Expectations"
"society and less open to Estella’s reproach.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The old Battery out on the marshes was our place of study, and a broken","Great Expectations"
"slate and a short piece of slate-pencil were our educational","Great Expectations"
"implements: to which Joe always added a pipe of tobacco. I never knew","Great Expectations"
"Joe to remember anything from one Sunday to another, or to acquire,","Great Expectations"
"under my tuition, any piece of information whatever. Yet he would smoke","Great Expectations"
"his pipe at the Battery with a far more sagacious air than anywhere","Great Expectations"
"else,—even with a learned air,—as if he considered himself to be","Great Expectations"
"advancing immensely. Dear fellow, I hope he did.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was pleasant and quiet, out there with the sails on the river","Great Expectations"
"passing beyond the earthwork, and sometimes, when the tide was low,","Great Expectations"
"looking as if they belonged to sunken ships that were still sailing on","Great Expectations"
"at the bottom of the water. Whenever I watched the vessels standing out","Great Expectations"
"to sea with their white sails spread, I somehow thought of Miss","Great Expectations"
"Havisham and Estella; and whenever the light struck aslant, afar off,","Great Expectations"
"upon a cloud or sail or green hillside or water-line, it was just the","Great Expectations"
"same.—Miss Havisham and Estella and the strange house and the strange","Great Expectations"
"life appeared to have something to do with everything that was","Great Expectations"
"picturesque.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"One Sunday when Joe, greatly enjoying his pipe, had so plumed himself","Great Expectations"
"on being “most awful dull,” that I had given him up for the day, I lay","Great Expectations"
"on the earthwork for some time with my chin on my hand, descrying","Great Expectations"
"traces of Miss Havisham and Estella all over the prospect, in the sky","Great Expectations"
"and in the water, until at last I resolved to mention a thought","Great Expectations"
"concerning them that had been much in my head.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Joe,” said I; “don’t you think I ought to make Miss Havisham a visit?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well, Pip,” returned Joe, slowly considering. “What for?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What for, Joe? What is any visit made for?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“There is some wisits p’r’aps,” said Joe, “as for ever remains open to","Great Expectations"
"the question, Pip. But in regard to wisiting Miss Havisham. She might","Great Expectations"
"think you wanted something,—expected something of her.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Don’t you think I might say that I did not, Joe?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You might, old chap,” said Joe. “And she might credit it. Similarly","Great Expectations"
"she mightn’t.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Joe felt, as I did, that he had made a point there, and he pulled hard","Great Expectations"
"at his pipe to keep himself from weakening it by repetition.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You see, Pip,” Joe pursued, as soon as he was past that danger, “Miss","Great Expectations"
"Havisham done the handsome thing by you. When Miss Havisham done the","Great Expectations"
"handsome thing by you, she called me back to say to me as that were","Great Expectations"
"all.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, Joe. I heard her.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“ALL,” Joe repeated, very emphatically.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, Joe. I tell you, I heard her.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Which I meantersay, Pip, it might be that her meaning were,—Make a end","Great Expectations"
"on it!—As you was!—Me to the North, and you to the South!—Keep in","Great Expectations"
"sunders!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I had thought of that too, and it was very far from comforting to me to","Great Expectations"
"find that he had thought of it; for it seemed to render it more","Great Expectations"
"probable.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“But, Joe.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, old chap.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Here am I, getting on in the first year of my time, and, since the day","Great Expectations"
"of my being bound, I have never thanked Miss Havisham, or asked after","Great Expectations"
"her, or shown that I remember her.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“That’s true, Pip; and unless you was to turn her out a set of shoes","Great Expectations"
"all four round,—and which I meantersay as even a set of shoes all four","Great Expectations"
"round might not be acceptable as a present, in a total wacancy of","Great Expectations"
"hoofs—”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I don’t mean that sort of remembrance, Joe; I don’t mean a present.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"But Joe had got the idea of a present in his head and must harp upon","Great Expectations"
"it. “Or even,” said he, “if you was helped to knocking her up a new","Great Expectations"
"chain for the front door,—or say a gross or two of shark-headed screws","Great Expectations"
"for general use,—or some light fancy article, such as a toasting-fork","Great Expectations"
"when she took her muffins,—or a gridiron when she took a sprat or such","Great Expectations"
"like—”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I don’t mean any present at all, Joe,” I interposed.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well,” said Joe, still harping on it as though I had particularly","Great Expectations"
"pressed it, “if I was yourself, Pip, I wouldn’t. No, I would _not_. For","Great Expectations"
"what’s a door-chain when she’s got one always up? And shark-headers is","Great Expectations"
"open to misrepresentations. And if it was a toasting-fork, you’d go","Great Expectations"
"into brass and do yourself no credit. And the oncommonest workman can’t","Great Expectations"
"show himself oncommon in a gridiron,—for a gridiron IS a gridiron,”","Great Expectations"
"said Joe, steadfastly impressing it upon me, as if he were endeavouring","Great Expectations"
"to rouse me from a fixed delusion, “and you may haim at what you like,","Great Expectations"
"but a gridiron it will come out, either by your leave or again your","Great Expectations"
"leave, and you can’t help yourself—”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“My dear Joe,” I cried, in desperation, taking hold of his coat, “don’t","Great Expectations"
"go on in that way. I never thought of making Miss Havisham any","Great Expectations"
"present.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No, Pip,” Joe assented, as if he had been contending for that, all","Great Expectations"
"along; “and what I say to you is, you are right, Pip.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, Joe; but what I wanted to say, was, that as we are rather slack","Great Expectations"
"just now, if you would give me a half-holiday to-morrow, I think I","Great Expectations"
"would go uptown and make a call on Miss Est—Havisham.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Which her name,” said Joe, gravely, “ain’t Estavisham, Pip, unless she","Great Expectations"
"have been rechris’ened.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I know, Joe, I know. It was a slip of mine. What do you think of it,","Great Expectations"
"Joe?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"In brief, Joe thought that if I thought well of it, he thought well of","Great Expectations"
"it. But, he was particular in stipulating that if I were not received","Great Expectations"
"with cordiality, or if I were not encouraged to repeat my visit as a","Great Expectations"
"visit which had no ulterior object but was simply one of gratitude for","Great Expectations"
"a favour received, then this experimental trip should have no","Great Expectations"
"successor. By these conditions I promised to abide.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Now, Joe kept a journeyman at weekly wages whose name was Orlick. He","Great Expectations"
"pretended that his Christian name was Dolge,—a clear Impossibility,—but","Great Expectations"
"he was a fellow of that obstinate disposition that I believe him to","Great Expectations"
"have been the prey of no delusion in this particular, but wilfully to","Great Expectations"
"have imposed that name upon the village as an affront to its","Great Expectations"
"understanding. He was a broadshouldered loose-limbed swarthy fellow of","Great Expectations"
"great strength, never in a hurry, and always slouching. He never even","Great Expectations"
"seemed to come to his work on purpose, but would slouch in as if by","Great Expectations"
"mere accident; and when he went to the Jolly Bargemen to eat his","Great Expectations"
"dinner, or went away at night, he would slouch out, like Cain or the","Great Expectations"
"Wandering Jew, as if he had no idea where he was going and no intention","Great Expectations"
"of ever coming back. He lodged at a sluice-keeper’s out on the marshes,","Great Expectations"
"and on working-days would come slouching from his hermitage, with his","Great Expectations"
"hands in his pockets and his dinner loosely tied in a bundle round his","Great Expectations"
"neck and dangling on his back. On Sundays he mostly lay all day on the","Great Expectations"
"sluice-gates, or stood against ricks and barns. He always slouched,","Great Expectations"
"locomotively, with his eyes on the ground; and, when accosted or","Great Expectations"
"otherwise required to raise them, he looked up in a half-resentful,","Great Expectations"
"half-puzzled way, as though the only thought he ever had was, that it","Great Expectations"
"was rather an odd and injurious fact that he should never be thinking.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"This morose journeyman had no liking for me. When I was very small and","Great Expectations"
"timid, he gave me to understand that the Devil lived in a black corner","Great Expectations"
"of the forge, and that he knew the fiend very well: also that it was","Great Expectations"
"necessary to make up the fire, once in seven years, with a live boy,","Great Expectations"
"and that I might consider myself fuel. When I became Joe’s ’prentice,","Great Expectations"
"Orlick was perhaps confirmed in some suspicion that I should displace","Great Expectations"
"him; howbeit, he liked me still less. Not that he ever said anything,","Great Expectations"
"or did anything, openly importing hostility; I only noticed that he","Great Expectations"
"always beat his sparks in my direction, and that whenever I sang Old","Great Expectations"
"Clem, he came in out of time.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Dolge Orlick was at work and present, next day, when I reminded Joe of","Great Expectations"
"my half-holiday. He said nothing at the moment, for he and Joe had just","Great Expectations"
"got a piece of hot iron between them, and I was at the bellows; but by","Great Expectations"
"and by he said, leaning on his hammer,—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Now, master! Sure you’re not a-going to favour only one of us. If","Great Expectations"
"Young Pip has a half-holiday, do as much for Old Orlick.” I suppose he","Great Expectations"
"was about five-and-twenty, but he usually spoke of himself as an","Great Expectations"
"ancient person.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Why, what’ll you do with a half-holiday, if you get it?” said Joe.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What’ll _I_ do with it! What’ll _he_ do with it? I’ll do as much with","Great Expectations"
"it as _him_,” said Orlick.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“As to Pip, he’s going up town,” said Joe.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well then, as to Old Orlick, _he_’s a-going up town,” retorted that","Great Expectations"
"worthy. “Two can go up town. Tain’t only one wot can go up town.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Don’t lose your temper,” said Joe.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Shall if I like,” growled Orlick. “Some and their uptowning! Now,","Great Expectations"
"master! Come. No favouring in this shop. Be a man!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The master refusing to entertain the subject until the journeyman was","Great Expectations"
"in a better temper, Orlick plunged at the furnace, drew out a red-hot","Great Expectations"
"bar, made at me with it as if he were going to run it through my body,","Great Expectations"
"whisked it round my head, laid it on the anvil, hammered it out,—as if","Great Expectations"
"it were I, I thought, and the sparks were my spirting blood,—and","Great Expectations"
"finally said, when he had hammered himself hot and the iron cold, and","Great Expectations"
"he again leaned on his hammer,—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Now, master!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Are you all right now?” demanded Joe.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Ah! I am all right,” said gruff Old Orlick.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Then, as in general you stick to your work as well as most men,” said","Great Expectations"
"Joe, “let it be a half-holiday for all.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"My sister had been standing silent in the yard, within hearing,—she was","Great Expectations"
"a most unscrupulous spy and listener,—and she instantly looked in at","Great Expectations"
"one of the windows.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Like you, you fool!” said she to Joe, “giving holidays to great idle","Great Expectations"
"hulkers like that. You are a rich man, upon my life, to waste wages in","Great Expectations"
"that way. I wish _I_ was his master!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You’d be everybody’s master, if you durst,” retorted Orlick, with an","Great Expectations"
"ill-favoured grin.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"(“Let her alone,” said Joe.)","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I’d be a match for all noodles and all rogues,” returned my sister,","Great Expectations"
"beginning to work herself into a mighty rage. “And I couldn’t be a","Great Expectations"
"match for the noodles, without being a match for your master, who’s the","Great Expectations"
"dunder-headed king of the noodles. And I couldn’t be a match for the","Great Expectations"
"rogues, without being a match for you, who are the blackest-looking and","Great Expectations"
"the worst rogue between this and France. Now!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You’re a foul shrew, Mother Gargery,” growled the journeyman. “If that","Great Expectations"
"makes a judge of rogues, you ought to be a good’un.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"(“Let her alone, will you?” said Joe.)","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What did you say?” cried my sister, beginning to scream. “What did you","Great Expectations"
"say? What did that fellow Orlick say to me, Pip? What did he call me,","Great Expectations"
"with my husband standing by? Oh! oh! oh!” Each of these exclamations","Great Expectations"
"was a shriek; and I must remark of my sister, what is equally true of","Great Expectations"
"all the violent women I have ever seen, that passion was no excuse for","Great Expectations"
"her, because it is undeniable that instead of lapsing into passion, she","Great Expectations"
"consciously and deliberately took extraordinary pains to force herself","Great Expectations"
"into it, and became blindly furious by regular stages; “what was the","Great Expectations"
"name he gave me before the base man who swore to defend me? Oh! Hold","Great Expectations"
"me! Oh!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Ah-h-h!” growled the journeyman, between his teeth, “I’d hold you, if","Great Expectations"
"you was my wife. I’d hold you under the pump, and choke it out of you.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"(“I tell you, let her alone,” said Joe.)","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Oh! To hear him!” cried my sister, with a clap of her hands and a","Great Expectations"
"scream together,—which was her next stage. “To hear the names he’s","Great Expectations"
"giving me! That Orlick! In my own house! Me, a married woman! With my","Great Expectations"
"husband standing by! Oh! Oh!” Here my sister, after a fit of clappings","Great Expectations"
"and screamings, beat her hands upon her bosom and upon her knees, and","Great Expectations"
"threw her cap off, and pulled her hair down,—which were the last stages","Great Expectations"
"on her road to frenzy. Being by this time a perfect Fury and a complete","Great Expectations"
"success, she made a dash at the door which I had fortunately locked.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"What could the wretched Joe do now, after his disregarded parenthetical","Great Expectations"
"interruptions, but stand up to his journeyman, and ask him what he","Great Expectations"
"meant by interfering betwixt himself and Mrs. Joe; and further whether","Great Expectations"
"he was man enough to come on? Old Orlick felt that the situation","Great Expectations"
"admitted of nothing less than coming on, and was on his defence","Great Expectations"
"straightway; so, without so much as pulling off their singed and burnt","Great Expectations"
"aprons, they went at one another, like two giants. But, if any man in","Great Expectations"
"that neighbourhood could stand uplong against Joe, I never saw the man.","Great Expectations"
"Orlick, as if he had been of no more account than the pale young","Great Expectations"
"gentleman, was very soon among the coal-dust, and in no hurry to come","Great Expectations"
"out of it. Then Joe unlocked the door and picked up my sister, who had","Great Expectations"
"dropped insensible at the window (but who had seen the fight first, I","Great Expectations"
"think), and who was carried into the house and laid down, and who was","Great Expectations"
"recommended to revive, and would do nothing but struggle and clench her","Great Expectations"
"hands in Joe’s hair. Then came that singular calm and silence which","Great Expectations"
"succeed all uproars; and then, with the vague sensation which I have","Great Expectations"
"always connected with such a lull,—namely, that it was Sunday, and","Great Expectations"
"somebody was dead,—I went upstairs to dress myself.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"[Illustration]","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"When I came down again, I found Joe and Orlick sweeping up, without any","Great Expectations"
"other traces of discomposure than a slit in one of Orlick’s nostrils,","Great Expectations"
"which was neither expressive nor ornamental. A pot of beer had appeared","Great Expectations"
"from the Jolly Bargemen, and they were sharing it by turns in a","Great Expectations"
"peaceable manner. The lull had a sedative and philosophical influence","Great Expectations"
"on Joe, who followed me out into the road to say, as a parting","Great Expectations"
"observation that might do me good, “On the Rampage, Pip, and off the","Great Expectations"
"Rampage, Pip:—such is Life!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"With what absurd emotions (for we think the feelings that are very","Great Expectations"
"serious in a man quite comical in a boy) I found myself again going to","Great Expectations"
"Miss Havisham’s, matters little here. Nor, how I passed and repassed","Great Expectations"
"the gate many times before I could make up my mind to ring. Nor, how I","Great Expectations"
"debated whether I should go away without ringing; nor, how I should","Great Expectations"
"undoubtedly have gone, if my time had been my own, to come back.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Miss Sarah Pocket came to the gate. No Estella.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“How, then? You here again?” said Miss Pocket. “What do you want?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"When I said that I only came to see how Miss Havisham was, Sarah","Great Expectations"
"evidently deliberated whether or no she should send me about my","Great Expectations"
"business. But unwilling to hazard the responsibility, she let me in,","Great Expectations"
"and presently brought the sharp message that I was to “come up.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Everything was unchanged, and Miss Havisham was alone.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well?” said she, fixing her eyes upon me. “I hope you want nothing?","Great Expectations"
"You’ll get nothing.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No indeed, Miss Havisham. I only wanted you to know that I am doing","Great Expectations"
"very well in my apprenticeship, and am always much obliged to you.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“There, there!” with the old restless fingers. “Come now and then; come","Great Expectations"
"on your birthday.—Ay!” she cried suddenly, turning herself and her","Great Expectations"
"chair towards me, “You are looking round for Estella? Hey?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I had been looking round,—in fact, for Estella,—and I stammered that I","Great Expectations"
"hoped she was well.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Abroad,” said Miss Havisham; “educating for a lady; far out of reach;","Great Expectations"
"prettier than ever; admired by all who see her. Do you feel that you","Great Expectations"
"have lost her?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"There was such a malignant enjoyment in her utterance of the last","Great Expectations"
"words, and she broke into such a disagreeable laugh, that I was at a","Great Expectations"
"loss what to say. She spared me the trouble of considering, by","Great Expectations"
"dismissing me. When the gate was closed upon me by Sarah of the","Great Expectations"
"walnut-shell countenance, I felt more than ever dissatisfied with my","Great Expectations"
"home and with my trade and with everything; and that was all I took by","Great Expectations"
"_that_ motion.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As I was loitering along the High Street, looking in disconsolately at","Great Expectations"
"the shop windows, and thinking what I would buy if I were a gentleman,","Great Expectations"
"who should come out of the bookshop but Mr. Wopsle. Mr. Wopsle had in","Great Expectations"
"his hand the affecting tragedy of George Barnwell, in which he had that","Great Expectations"
"moment invested sixpence, with the view of heaping every word of it on","Great Expectations"
"the head of Pumblechook, with whom he was going to drink tea. No sooner","Great Expectations"
"did he see me, than he appeared to consider that a special Providence","Great Expectations"
"had put a ’prentice in his way to be read at; and he laid hold of me,","Great Expectations"
"and insisted on my accompanying him to the Pumblechookian parlour. As I","Great Expectations"
"knew it would be miserable at home, and as the nights were dark and the","Great Expectations"
"way was dreary, and almost any companionship on the road was better","Great Expectations"
"than none, I made no great resistance; consequently, we turned into","Great Expectations"
"Pumblechook’s just as the street and the shops were lighting up.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As I never assisted at any other representation of George Barnwell, I","Great Expectations"
"don’t know how long it may usually take; but I know very well that it","Great Expectations"
"took until half-past nine o’ clock that night, and that when Mr. Wopsle","Great Expectations"
"got into Newgate, I thought he never would go to the scaffold, he","Great Expectations"
"became so much slower than at any former period of his disgraceful","Great Expectations"
"career. I thought it a little too much that he should complain of being","Great Expectations"
"cut short in his flower after all, as if he had not been running to","Great Expectations"
"seed, leaf after leaf, ever since his course began. This, however, was","Great Expectations"
"a mere question of length and wearisomeness. What stung me, was the","Great Expectations"
"identification of the whole affair with my unoffending self. When","Great Expectations"
"Barnwell began to go wrong, I declare that I felt positively","Great Expectations"
"apologetic, Pumblechook’s indignant stare so taxed me with it. Wopsle,","Great Expectations"
"too, took pains to present me in the worst light. At once ferocious and","Great Expectations"
"maudlin, I was made to murder my uncle with no extenuating","Great Expectations"
"circumstances whatever; Millwood put me down in argument, on every","Great Expectations"
"occasion; it became sheer monomania in my master’s daughter to care a","Great Expectations"
"button for me; and all I can say for my gasping and procrastinating","Great Expectations"
"conduct on the fatal morning, is, that it was worthy of the general","Great Expectations"
"feebleness of my character. Even after I was happily hanged and Wopsle","Great Expectations"
"had closed the book, Pumblechook sat staring at me, and shaking his","Great Expectations"
"head, and saying, “Take warning, boy, take warning!” as if it were a","Great Expectations"
"well-known fact that I contemplated murdering a near relation, provided","Great Expectations"
"I could only induce one to have the weakness to become my benefactor.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was a very dark night when it was all over, and when I set out with","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Wopsle on the walk home. Beyond town, we found a heavy mist out,","Great Expectations"
"and it fell wet and thick. The turnpike lamp was a blur, quite out of","Great Expectations"
"the lamp’s usual place apparently, and its rays looked solid substance","Great Expectations"
"on the fog. We were noticing this, and saying how that the mist rose","Great Expectations"
"with a change of wind from a certain quarter of our marshes, when we","Great Expectations"
"came upon a man, slouching under the lee of the turnpike house.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Halloa!” we said, stopping. “Orlick there?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Ah!” he answered, slouching out. “I was standing by a minute, on the","Great Expectations"
"chance of company.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You are late,” I remarked.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Orlick not unnaturally answered, “Well? And _you_’re late.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“We have been,” said Mr. Wopsle, exalted with his late performance,—“we","Great Expectations"
"have been indulging, Mr. Orlick, in an intellectual evening.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Old Orlick growled, as if he had nothing to say about that, and we all","Great Expectations"
"went on together. I asked him presently whether he had been spending","Great Expectations"
"his half-holiday up and down town?","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes,” said he, “all of it. I come in behind yourself. I didn’t see","Great Expectations"
"you, but I must have been pretty close behind you. By the by, the guns","Great Expectations"
"is going again.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“At the Hulks?” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Ay! There’s some of the birds flown from the cages. The guns have been","Great Expectations"
"going since dark, about. You’ll hear one presently.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"In effect, we had not walked many yards further, when the","Great Expectations"
"well-remembered boom came towards us, deadened by the mist, and heavily","Great Expectations"
"rolled away along the low grounds by the river, as if it were pursuing","Great Expectations"
"and threatening the fugitives.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“A good night for cutting off in,” said Orlick. “We’d be puzzled how to","Great Expectations"
"bring down a jail-bird on the wing, to-night.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The subject was a suggestive one to me, and I thought about it in","Great Expectations"
"silence. Mr. Wopsle, as the ill-requited uncle of the evening’s","Great Expectations"
"tragedy, fell to meditating aloud in his garden at Camberwell. Orlick,","Great Expectations"
"with his hands in his pockets, slouched heavily at my side. It was very","Great Expectations"
"dark, very wet, very muddy, and so we splashed along. Now and then, the","Great Expectations"
"sound of the signal cannon broke upon us again, and again rolled","Great Expectations"
"sulkily along the course of the river. I kept myself to myself and my","Great Expectations"
"thoughts. Mr. Wopsle died amiably at Camberwell, and exceedingly game","Great Expectations"
"on Bosworth Field, and in the greatest agonies at Glastonbury. Orlick","Great Expectations"
"sometimes growled, “Beat it out, beat it out,—Old Clem! With a clink","Great Expectations"
"for the stout,—Old Clem!” I thought he had been drinking, but he was","Great Expectations"
"not drunk.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Thus, we came to the village. The way by which we approached it took us","Great Expectations"
"past the Three Jolly Bargemen, which we were surprised to find—it being","Great Expectations"
"eleven o’clock—in a state of commotion, with the door wide open, and","Great Expectations"
"unwonted lights that had been hastily caught up and put down scattered","Great Expectations"
"about. Mr. Wopsle dropped in to ask what was the matter (surmising that","Great Expectations"
"a convict had been taken), but came running out in a great hurry.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“There’s something wrong,” said he, without stopping, “up at your","Great Expectations"
"place, Pip. Run all!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What is it?” I asked, keeping up with him. So did Orlick, at my side.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I can’t quite understand. The house seems to have been violently","Great Expectations"
"entered when Joe Gargery was out. Supposed by convicts. Somebody has","Great Expectations"
"been attacked and hurt.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We were running too fast to admit of more being said, and we made no","Great Expectations"
"stop until we got into our kitchen. It was full of people; the whole","Great Expectations"
"village was there, or in the yard; and there was a surgeon, and there","Great Expectations"
"was Joe, and there were a group of women, all on the floor in the midst","Great Expectations"
"of the kitchen. The unemployed bystanders drew back when they saw me,","Great Expectations"
"and so I became aware of my sister,—lying without sense or movement on","Great Expectations"
"the bare boards where she had been knocked down by a tremendous blow on","Great Expectations"
"the back of the head, dealt by some unknown hand when her face was","Great Expectations"
"turned towards the fire,—destined never to be on the Rampage again,","Great Expectations"
"while she was the wife of Joe.","Great Expectations"

"","Great Expectations"
"Chapter XVI.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"With my head full of George Barnwell, I was at first disposed to","Great Expectations"
"believe that _I_ must have had some hand in the attack upon my sister,","Great Expectations"
"or at all events that as her near relation, popularly known to be under","Great Expectations"
"obligations to her, I was a more legitimate object of suspicion than","Great Expectations"
"any one else. But when, in the clearer light of next morning, I began","Great Expectations"
"to reconsider the matter and to hear it discussed around me on all","Great Expectations"
"sides, I took another view of the case, which was more reasonable.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Joe had been at the Three Jolly Bargemen, smoking his pipe, from a","Great Expectations"
"quarter after eight o’clock to a quarter before ten. While he was","Great Expectations"
"there, my sister had been seen standing at the kitchen door, and had","Great Expectations"
"exchanged Good Night with a farm-labourer going home. The man could not","Great Expectations"
"be more particular as to the time at which he saw her (he got into","Great Expectations"
"dense confusion when he tried to be), than that it must have been","Great Expectations"
"before nine. When Joe went home at five minutes before ten, he found","Great Expectations"
"her struck down on the floor, and promptly called in assistance. The","Great Expectations"
"fire had not then burnt unusually low, nor was the snuff of the candle","Great Expectations"
"very long; the candle, however, had been blown out.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Nothing had been taken away from any part of the house. Neither, beyond","Great Expectations"
"the blowing out of the candle,—which stood on a table between the door","Great Expectations"
"and my sister, and was behind her when she stood facing the fire and","Great Expectations"
"was struck,—was there any disarrangement of the kitchen, excepting such","Great Expectations"
"as she herself had made, in falling and bleeding. But, there was one","Great Expectations"
"remarkable piece of evidence on the spot. She had been struck with","Great Expectations"
"something blunt and heavy, on the head and spine; after the blows were","Great Expectations"
"dealt, something heavy had been thrown down at her with considerable","Great Expectations"
"violence, as she lay on her face. And on the ground beside her, when","Great Expectations"
"Joe picked her up, was a convict’s leg-iron which had been filed","Great Expectations"
"asunder.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Now, Joe, examining this iron with a smith’s eye, declared it to have","Great Expectations"
"been filed asunder some time ago. The hue and cry going off to the","Great Expectations"
"Hulks, and people coming thence to examine the iron, Joe’s opinion was","Great Expectations"
"corroborated. They did not undertake to say when it had left the","Great Expectations"
"prison-ships to which it undoubtedly had once belonged; but they","Great Expectations"
"claimed to know for certain that that particular manacle had not been","Great Expectations"
"worn by either of the two convicts who had escaped last night. Further,","Great Expectations"
"one of those two was already retaken, and had not freed himself of his","Great Expectations"
"iron.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Knowing what I knew, I set up an inference of my own here. I believed","Great Expectations"
"the iron to be my convict’s iron,—the iron I had seen and heard him","Great Expectations"
"filing at, on the marshes,—but my mind did not accuse him of having put","Great Expectations"
"it to its latest use. For I believed one of two other persons to have","Great Expectations"
"become possessed of it, and to have turned it to this cruel account.","Great Expectations"
"Either Orlick, or the strange man who had shown me the file.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Now, as to Orlick; he had gone to town exactly as he told us when we","Great Expectations"
"picked him up at the turnpike, he had been seen about town all the","Great Expectations"
"evening, he had been in divers companies in several public-houses, and","Great Expectations"
"he had come back with myself and Mr. Wopsle. There was nothing against","Great Expectations"
"him, save the quarrel; and my sister had quarrelled with him, and with","Great Expectations"
"everybody else about her, ten thousand times. As to the strange man; if","Great Expectations"
"he had come back for his two bank-notes there could have been no","Great Expectations"
"dispute about them, because my sister was fully prepared to restore","Great Expectations"
"them. Besides, there had been no altercation; the assailant had come in","Great Expectations"
"so silently and suddenly, that she had been felled before she could","Great Expectations"
"look round.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was horrible to think that I had provided the weapon, however","Great Expectations"
"undesignedly, but I could hardly think otherwise. I suffered","Great Expectations"
"unspeakable trouble while I considered and reconsidered whether I","Great Expectations"
"should at last dissolve that spell of my childhood and tell Joe all the","Great Expectations"
"story. For months afterwards, I every day settled the question finally","Great Expectations"
"in the negative, and reopened and reargued it next morning. The","Great Expectations"
"contention came, after all, to this;—the secret was such an old one","Great Expectations"
"now, had so grown into me and become a part of myself, that I could not","Great Expectations"
"tear it away. In addition to the dread that, having led up to so much","Great Expectations"
"mischief, it would be now more likely than ever to alienate Joe from me","Great Expectations"
"if he believed it, I had a further restraining dread that he would not","Great Expectations"
"believe it, but would assort it with the fabulous dogs and veal-cutlets","Great Expectations"
"as a monstrous invention. However, I temporized with myself, of","Great Expectations"
"course—for, was I not wavering between right and wrong, when the thing","Great Expectations"
"is always done?—and resolved to make a full disclosure if I should see","Great Expectations"
"any such new occasion as a new chance of helping in the discovery of","Great Expectations"
"the assailant.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The Constables and the Bow Street men from London—for, this happened in","Great Expectations"
"the days of the extinct red-waistcoated police—were about the house for","Great Expectations"
"a week or two, and did pretty much what I have heard and read of like","Great Expectations"
"authorities doing in other such cases. They took up several obviously","Great Expectations"
"wrong people, and they ran their heads very hard against wrong ideas,","Great Expectations"
"and persisted in trying to fit the circumstances to the ideas, instead","Great Expectations"
"of trying to extract ideas from the circumstances. Also, they stood","Great Expectations"
"about the door of the Jolly Bargemen, with knowing and reserved looks","Great Expectations"
"that filled the whole neighbourhood with admiration; and they had a","Great Expectations"
"mysterious manner of taking their drink, that was almost as good as","Great Expectations"
"taking the culprit. But not quite, for they never did it.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Long after these constitutional powers had dispersed, my sister lay","Great Expectations"
"very ill in bed. Her sight was disturbed, so that she saw objects","Great Expectations"
"multiplied, and grasped at visionary teacups and wineglasses instead of","Great Expectations"
"the realities; her hearing was greatly impaired; her memory also; and","Great Expectations"
"her speech was unintelligible. When, at last, she came round so far as","Great Expectations"
"to be helped downstairs, it was still necessary to keep my slate always","Great Expectations"
"by her, that she might indicate in writing what she could not indicate","Great Expectations"
"in speech. As she was (very bad handwriting apart) a more than","Great Expectations"
"indifferent speller, and as Joe was a more than indifferent reader,","Great Expectations"
"extraordinary complications arose between them which I was always","Great Expectations"
"called in to solve. The administration of mutton instead of medicine,","Great Expectations"
"the substitution of Tea for Joe, and the baker for bacon, were among","Great Expectations"
"the mildest of my own mistakes.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"However, her temper was greatly improved, and she was patient. A","Great Expectations"
"tremulous uncertainty of the action of all her limbs soon became a part","Great Expectations"
"of her regular state, and afterwards, at intervals of two or three","Great Expectations"
"months, she would often put her hands to her head, and would then","Great Expectations"
"remain for about a week at a time in some gloomy aberration of mind. We","Great Expectations"
"were at a loss to find a suitable attendant for her, until a","Great Expectations"
"circumstance happened conveniently to relieve us. Mr. Wopsle’s","Great Expectations"
"great-aunt conquered a confirmed habit of living into which she had","Great Expectations"
"fallen, and Biddy became a part of our establishment.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It may have been about a month after my sister’s reappearance in the","Great Expectations"
"kitchen, when Biddy came to us with a small speckled box containing the","Great Expectations"
"whole of her worldly effects, and became a blessing to the household.","Great Expectations"
"Above all, she was a blessing to Joe, for the dear old fellow was sadly","Great Expectations"
"cut up by the constant contemplation of the wreck of his wife, and had","Great Expectations"
"been accustomed, while attending on her of an evening, to turn to me","Great Expectations"
"every now and then and say, with his blue eyes moistened, “Such a fine","Great Expectations"
"figure of a woman as she once were, Pip!” Biddy instantly taking the","Great Expectations"
"cleverest charge of her as though she had studied her from infancy; Joe","Great Expectations"
"became able in some sort to appreciate the greater quiet of his life,","Great Expectations"
"and to get down to the Jolly Bargemen now and then for a change that","Great Expectations"
"did him good. It was characteristic of the police people that they had","Great Expectations"
"all more or less suspected poor Joe (though he never knew it), and that","Great Expectations"
"they had to a man concurred in regarding him as one of the deepest","Great Expectations"
"spirits they had ever encountered.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Biddy’s first triumph in her new office, was to solve a difficulty that","Great Expectations"
"had completely vanquished me. I had tried hard at it, but had made","Great Expectations"
"nothing of it. Thus it was:—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Again and again and again, my sister had traced upon the slate, a","Great Expectations"
"character that looked like a curious T, and then with the utmost","Great Expectations"
"eagerness had called our attention to it as something she particularly","Great Expectations"
"wanted. I had in vain tried everything producible that began with a T,","Great Expectations"
"from tar to toast and tub. At length it had come into my head that the","Great Expectations"
"sign looked like a hammer, and on my lustily calling that word in my","Great Expectations"
"sister’s ear, she had begun to hammer on the table and had expressed a","Great Expectations"
"qualified assent. Thereupon, I had brought in all our hammers, one","Great Expectations"
"after another, but without avail. Then I bethought me of a crutch, the","Great Expectations"
"shape being much the same, and I borrowed one in the village, and","Great Expectations"
"displayed it to my sister with considerable confidence. But she shook","Great Expectations"
"her head to that extent when she was shown it, that we were terrified","Great Expectations"
"lest in her weak and shattered state she should dislocate her neck.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"When my sister found that Biddy was very quick to understand her, this","Great Expectations"
"mysterious sign reappeared on the slate. Biddy looked thoughtfully at","Great Expectations"
"it, heard my explanation, looked thoughtfully at my sister, looked","Great Expectations"
"thoughtfully at Joe (who was always represented on the slate by his","Great Expectations"
"initial letter), and ran into the forge, followed by Joe and me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Why, of course!” cried Biddy, with an exultant face. “Don’t you see?","Great Expectations"
"It’s _him_!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Orlick, without a doubt! She had lost his name, and could only signify","Great Expectations"
"him by his hammer. We told him why we wanted him to come into the","Great Expectations"
"kitchen, and he slowly laid down his hammer, wiped his brow with his","Great Expectations"
"arm, took another wipe at it with his apron, and came slouching out,","Great Expectations"
"with a curious loose vagabond bend in the knees that strongly","Great Expectations"
"distinguished him.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I confess that I expected to see my sister denounce him, and that I was","Great Expectations"
"disappointed by the different result. She manifested the greatest","Great Expectations"
"anxiety to be on good terms with him, was evidently much pleased by his","Great Expectations"
"being at length produced, and motioned that she would have him given","Great Expectations"
"something to drink. She watched his countenance as if she were","Great Expectations"
"particularly wishful to be assured that he took kindly to his","Great Expectations"
"reception, she showed every possible desire to conciliate him, and","Great Expectations"
"there was an air of humble propitiation in all she did, such as I have","Great Expectations"
"seen pervade the bearing of a child towards a hard master. After that","Great Expectations"
"day, a day rarely passed without her drawing the hammer on her slate,","Great Expectations"
"and without Orlick’s slouching in and standing doggedly before her, as","Great Expectations"
"if he knew no more than I did what to make of it.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Chapter XVII.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I now fell into a regular routine of apprenticeship life, which was","Great Expectations"
"varied beyond the limits of the village and the marshes, by no more","Great Expectations"
"remarkable circumstance than the arrival of my birthday and my paying","Great Expectations"
"another visit to Miss Havisham. I found Miss Sarah Pocket still on duty","Great Expectations"
"at the gate; I found Miss Havisham just as I had left her, and she","Great Expectations"
"spoke of Estella in the very same way, if not in the very same words.","Great Expectations"
"The interview lasted but a few minutes, and she gave me a guinea when I","Great Expectations"
"was going, and told me to come again on my next birthday. I may mention","Great Expectations"
"at once that this became an annual custom. I tried to decline taking","Great Expectations"
"the guinea on the first occasion, but with no better effect than","Great Expectations"
"causing her to ask me very angrily, if I expected more? Then, and after","Great Expectations"
"that, I took it.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"So unchanging was the dull old house, the yellow light in the darkened","Great Expectations"
"room, the faded spectre in the chair by the dressing-table glass, that","Great Expectations"
"I felt as if the stopping of the clocks had stopped Time in that","Great Expectations"
"mysterious place, and, while I and everything else outside it grew","Great Expectations"
"older, it stood still. Daylight never entered the house as to my","Great Expectations"
"thoughts and remembrances of it, any more than as to the actual fact.","Great Expectations"
"It bewildered me, and under its influence I continued at heart to hate","Great Expectations"
"my trade and to be ashamed of home.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Imperceptibly I became conscious of a change in Biddy, however. Her","Great Expectations"
"shoes came up at the heel, her hair grew bright and neat, her hands","Great Expectations"
"were always clean. She was not beautiful,—she was common, and could not","Great Expectations"
"be like Estella,—but she was pleasant and wholesome and sweet-tempered.","Great Expectations"
"She had not been with us more than a year (I remember her being newly","Great Expectations"
"out of mourning at the time it struck me), when I observed to myself","Great Expectations"
"one evening that she had curiously thoughtful and attentive eyes; eyes","Great Expectations"
"that were very pretty and very good.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It came of my lifting up my own eyes from a task I was poring","Great Expectations"
"at—writing some passages from a book, to improve myself in two ways at","Great Expectations"
"once by a sort of stratagem—and seeing Biddy observant of what I was","Great Expectations"
"about. I laid down my pen, and Biddy stopped in her needlework without","Great Expectations"
"laying it down.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Biddy,” said I, “how do you manage it? Either I am very stupid, or you","Great Expectations"
"are very clever.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What is it that I manage? I don’t know,” returned Biddy, smiling.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"She managed our whole domestic life, and wonderfully too; but I did not","Great Expectations"
"mean that, though that made what I did mean more surprising.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“How do you manage, Biddy,” said I, “to learn everything that I learn,","Great Expectations"
"and always to keep up with me?” I was beginning to be rather vain of my","Great Expectations"
"knowledge, for I spent my birthday guineas on it, and set aside the","Great Expectations"
"greater part of my pocket-money for similar investment; though I have","Great Expectations"
"no doubt, now, that the little I knew was extremely dear at the price.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I might as well ask you,” said Biddy, “how _you_ manage?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No; because when I come in from the forge of a night, any one can see","Great Expectations"
"me turning to at it. But you never turn to at it, Biddy.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I suppose I must catch it like a cough,” said Biddy, quietly; and went","Great Expectations"
"on with her sewing.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Pursuing my idea as I leaned back in my wooden chair, and looked at","Great Expectations"
"Biddy sewing away with her head on one side, I began to think her","Great Expectations"
"rather an extraordinary girl. For I called to mind now, that she was","Great Expectations"
"equally accomplished in the terms of our trade, and the names of our","Great Expectations"
"different sorts of work, and our various tools. In short, whatever I","Great Expectations"
"knew, Biddy knew. Theoretically, she was already as good a blacksmith","Great Expectations"
"as I, or better.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You are one of those, Biddy,” said I, “who make the most of every","Great Expectations"
"chance. You never had a chance before you came here, and see how","Great Expectations"
"improved you are!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Biddy looked at me for an instant, and went on with her sewing. “I was","Great Expectations"
"your first teacher though; wasn’t I?” said she, as she sewed.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Biddy!” I exclaimed, in amazement. “Why, you are crying!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No I am not,” said Biddy, looking up and laughing. “What put that in","Great Expectations"
"your head?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"What could have put it in my head but the glistening of a tear as it","Great Expectations"
"dropped on her work? I sat silent, recalling what a drudge she had been","Great Expectations"
"until Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt successfully overcame that bad habit of","Great Expectations"
"living, so highly desirable to be got rid of by some people. I recalled","Great Expectations"
"the hopeless circumstances by which she had been surrounded in the","Great Expectations"
"miserable little shop and the miserable little noisy evening school,","Great Expectations"
"with that miserable old bundle of incompetence always to be dragged and","Great Expectations"
"shouldered. I reflected that even in those untoward times there must","Great Expectations"
"have been latent in Biddy what was now developing, for, in my first","Great Expectations"
"uneasiness and discontent I had turned to her for help, as a matter of","Great Expectations"
"course. Biddy sat quietly sewing, shedding no more tears, and while I","Great Expectations"
"looked at her and thought about it all, it occurred to me that perhaps","Great Expectations"
"I had not been sufficiently grateful to Biddy. I might have been too","Great Expectations"
"reserved, and should have patronised her more (though I did not use","Great Expectations"
"that precise word in my meditations) with my confidence.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, Biddy,” I observed, when I had done turning it over, “you were my","Great Expectations"
"first teacher, and that at a time when we little thought of ever being","Great Expectations"
"together like this, in this kitchen.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Ah, poor thing!” replied Biddy. It was like her self-forgetfulness to","Great Expectations"
"transfer the remark to my sister, and to get up and be busy about her,","Great Expectations"
"making her more comfortable; “that’s sadly true!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well!” said I, “we must talk together a little more, as we used to do.","Great Expectations"
"And I must consult you a little more, as I used to do. Let us have a","Great Expectations"
"quiet walk on the marshes next Sunday, Biddy, and a long chat.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"My sister was never left alone now; but Joe more than readily undertook","Great Expectations"
"the care of her on that Sunday afternoon, and Biddy and I went out","Great Expectations"
"together. It was summer-time, and lovely weather. When we had passed","Great Expectations"
"the village and the church and the churchyard, and were out on the","Great Expectations"
"marshes and began to see the sails of the ships as they sailed on, I","Great Expectations"
"began to combine Miss Havisham and Estella with the prospect, in my","Great Expectations"
"usual way. When we came to the river-side and sat down on the bank,","Great Expectations"
"with the water rippling at our feet, making it all more quiet than it","Great Expectations"
"would have been without that sound, I resolved that it was a good time","Great Expectations"
"and place for the admission of Biddy into my inner confidence.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Biddy,” said I, after binding her to secrecy, “I want to be a","Great Expectations"
"gentleman.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“O, I wouldn’t, if I was you!” she returned. “I don’t think it would","Great Expectations"
"answer.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Biddy,” said I, with some severity, “I have particular reasons for","Great Expectations"
"wanting to be a gentleman.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You know best, Pip; but don’t you think you are happier as you are?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Biddy,” I exclaimed, impatiently, “I am not at all happy as I am. I am","Great Expectations"
"disgusted with my calling and with my life. I have never taken to","Great Expectations"
"either, since I was bound. Don’t be absurd.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Was I absurd?” said Biddy, quietly raising her eyebrows; “I am sorry","Great Expectations"
"for that; I didn’t mean to be. I only want you to do well, and to be","Great Expectations"
"comfortable.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well, then, understand once for all that I never shall or can be","Great Expectations"
"comfortable—or anything but miserable—there, Biddy!—unless I can lead a","Great Expectations"
"very different sort of life from the life I lead now.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“That’s a pity!” said Biddy, shaking her head with a sorrowful air.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Now, I too had so often thought it a pity, that, in the singular kind","Great Expectations"
"of quarrel with myself which I was always carrying on, I was half","Great Expectations"
"inclined to shed tears of vexation and distress when Biddy gave","Great Expectations"
"utterance to her sentiment and my own. I told her she was right, and I","Great Expectations"
"knew it was much to be regretted, but still it was not to be helped.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“If I could have settled down,” I said to Biddy, plucking up the short","Great Expectations"
"grass within reach, much as I had once upon a time pulled my feelings","Great Expectations"
"out of my hair and kicked them into the brewery wall,—“if I could have","Great Expectations"
"settled down and been but half as fond of the forge as I was when I was","Great Expectations"
"little, I know it would have been much better for me. You and I and Joe","Great Expectations"
"would have wanted nothing then, and Joe and I would perhaps have gone","Great Expectations"
"partners when I was out of my time, and I might even have grown up to","Great Expectations"
"keep company with you, and we might have sat on this very bank on a","Great Expectations"
"fine Sunday, quite different people. I should have been good enough for","Great Expectations"
"_you_; shouldn’t I, Biddy?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Biddy sighed as she looked at the ships sailing on, and returned for","Great Expectations"
"answer, “Yes; I am not over-particular.” It scarcely sounded","Great Expectations"
"flattering, but I knew she meant well.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Instead of that,” said I, plucking up more grass and chewing a blade","Great Expectations"
"or two, “see how I am going on. Dissatisfied, and uncomfortable,","Great Expectations"
"and—what would it signify to me, being coarse and common, if nobody had","Great Expectations"
"told me so!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Biddy turned her face suddenly towards mine, and looked far more","Great Expectations"
"attentively at me than she had looked at the sailing ships.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It was neither a very true nor a very polite thing to say,” she","Great Expectations"
"remarked, directing her eyes to the ships again. “Who said it?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I was disconcerted, for I had broken away without quite seeing where I","Great Expectations"
"was going to. It was not to be shuffled off now, however, and I","Great Expectations"
"answered, “The beautiful young lady at Miss Havisham’s, and she’s more","Great Expectations"
"beautiful than anybody ever was, and I admire her dreadfully, and I","Great Expectations"
"want to be a gentleman on her account.” Having made this lunatic","Great Expectations"
"confession, I began to throw my torn-up grass into the river, as if I","Great Expectations"
"had some thoughts of following it.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Do you want to be a gentleman, to spite her or to gain her over?”","Great Expectations"
"Biddy quietly asked me, after a pause.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I don’t know,” I moodily answered.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Because, if it is to spite her,” Biddy pursued, “I should think—but","Great Expectations"
"you know best—that might be better and more independently done by","Great Expectations"
"caring nothing for her words. And if it is to gain her over, I should","Great Expectations"
"think—but you know best—she was not worth gaining over.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Exactly what I myself had thought, many times. Exactly what was","Great Expectations"
"perfectly manifest to me at the moment. But how could I, a poor dazed","Great Expectations"
"village lad, avoid that wonderful inconsistency into which the best and","Great Expectations"
"wisest of men fall every day?","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It may be all quite true,” said I to Biddy, “but I admire her","Great Expectations"
"dreadfully.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"In short, I turned over on my face when I came to that, and got a good","Great Expectations"
"grasp on the hair on each side of my head, and wrenched it well. All","Great Expectations"
"the while knowing the madness of my heart to be so very mad and","Great Expectations"
"misplaced, that I was quite conscious it would have served my face","Great Expectations"
"right, if I had lifted it up by my hair, and knocked it against the","Great Expectations"
"pebbles as a punishment for belonging to such an idiot.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Biddy was the wisest of girls, and she tried to reason no more with me.","Great Expectations"
"She put her hand, which was a comfortable hand though roughened by","Great Expectations"
"work, upon my hands, one after another, and gently took them out of my","Great Expectations"
"hair. Then she softly patted my shoulder in a soothing way, while with","Great Expectations"
"my face upon my sleeve I cried a little,—exactly as I had done in the","Great Expectations"
"brewery yard,—and felt vaguely convinced that I was very much ill-used","Great Expectations"
"by somebody, or by everybody; I can’t say which.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I am glad of one thing,” said Biddy, “and that is, that you have felt","Great Expectations"
"you could give me your confidence, Pip. And I am glad of another thing,","Great Expectations"
"and that is, that of course you know you may depend upon my keeping it","Great Expectations"
"and always so far deserving it. If your first teacher (dear! such a","Great Expectations"
"poor one, and so much in need of being taught herself!) had been your","Great Expectations"
"teacher at the present time, she thinks she knows what lesson she would","Great Expectations"
"set. But it would be a hard one to learn, and you have got beyond her,","Great Expectations"
"and it’s of no use now.” So, with a quiet sigh for me, Biddy rose from","Great Expectations"
"the bank, and said, with a fresh and pleasant change of voice, “Shall","Great Expectations"
"we walk a little farther, or go home?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Biddy,” I cried, getting up, putting my arm round her neck, and giving","Great Expectations"
"her a kiss, “I shall always tell you everything.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Till you’re a gentleman,” said Biddy.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You know I never shall be, so that’s always. Not that I have any","Great Expectations"
"occasion to tell you anything, for you know everything I know,—as I","Great Expectations"
"told you at home the other night.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Ah!” said Biddy, quite in a whisper, as she looked away at the ships.","Great Expectations"
"And then repeated, with her former pleasant change, “shall we walk a","Great Expectations"
"little farther, or go home?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I said to Biddy we would walk a little farther, and we did so, and the","Great Expectations"
"summer afternoon toned down into the summer evening, and it was very","Great Expectations"
"beautiful. I began to consider whether I was not more naturally and","Great Expectations"
"wholesomely situated, after all, in these circumstances, than playing","Great Expectations"
"beggar my neighbour by candle-light in the room with the stopped","Great Expectations"
"clocks, and being despised by Estella. I thought it would be very good","Great Expectations"
"for me if I could get her out of my head, with all the rest of those","Great Expectations"
"remembrances and fancies, and could go to work determined to relish","Great Expectations"
"what I had to do, and stick to it, and make the best of it. I asked","Great Expectations"
"myself the question whether I did not surely know that if Estella were","Great Expectations"
"beside me at that moment instead of Biddy, she would make me miserable?","Great Expectations"
"I was obliged to admit that I did know it for a certainty, and I said","Great Expectations"
"to myself, “Pip, what a fool you are!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We talked a good deal as we walked, and all that Biddy said seemed","Great Expectations"
"right. Biddy was never insulting, or capricious, or Biddy to-day and","Great Expectations"
"somebody else to-morrow; she would have derived only pain, and no","Great Expectations"
"pleasure, from giving me pain; she would far rather have wounded her","Great Expectations"
"own breast than mine. How could it be, then, that I did not like her","Great Expectations"
"much the better of the two?","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Biddy,” said I, when we were walking homeward, “I wish you could put","Great Expectations"
"me right.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I wish I could!” said Biddy.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“If I could only get myself to fall in love with you,—you don’t mind my","Great Expectations"
"speaking so openly to such an old acquaintance?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Oh dear, not at all!” said Biddy. “Don’t mind me.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“If I could only get myself to do it, _that_ would be the thing for","Great Expectations"
"me.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“But you never will, you see,” said Biddy.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It did not appear quite so unlikely to me that evening, as it would","Great Expectations"
"have done if we had discussed it a few hours before. I therefore","Great Expectations"
"observed I was not quite sure of that. But Biddy said she _was_, and","Great Expectations"
"she said it decisively. In my heart I believed her to be right; and yet","Great Expectations"
"I took it rather ill, too, that she should be so positive on the point.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"When we came near the churchyard, we had to cross an embankment, and","Great Expectations"
"get over a stile near a sluice-gate. There started up, from the gate,","Great Expectations"
"or from the rushes, or from the ooze (which was quite in his stagnant","Great Expectations"
"way), Old Orlick.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Halloa!” he growled, “where are you two going?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Where should we be going, but home?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well, then,” said he, “I’m jiggered if I don’t see you home!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"This penalty of being jiggered was a favourite supposititious case of","Great Expectations"
"his. He attached no definite meaning to the word that I am aware of,","Great Expectations"
"but used it, like his own pretended Christian name, to affront mankind,","Great Expectations"
"and convey an idea of something savagely damaging. When I was younger,","Great Expectations"
"I had had a general belief that if he had jiggered me personally, he","Great Expectations"
"would have done it with a sharp and twisted hook.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Biddy was much against his going with us, and said to me in a whisper,","Great Expectations"
"“Don’t let him come; I don’t like him.” As I did not like him either, I","Great Expectations"
"took the liberty of saying that we thanked him, but we didn’t want","Great Expectations"
"seeing home. He received that piece of information with a yell of","Great Expectations"
"laughter, and dropped back, but came slouching after us at a little","Great Expectations"
"distance.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Curious to know whether Biddy suspected him of having had a hand in","Great Expectations"
"that murderous attack of which my sister had never been able to give","Great Expectations"
"any account, I asked her why she did not like him.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Oh!” she replied, glancing over her shoulder as he slouched after us,","Great Expectations"
"“because I—I am afraid he likes me.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Did he ever tell you he liked you?” I asked indignantly.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No,” said Biddy, glancing over her shoulder again, “he never told me","Great Expectations"
"so; but he dances at me, whenever he can catch my eye.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"However novel and peculiar this testimony of attachment, I did not","Great Expectations"
"doubt the accuracy of the interpretation. I was very hot indeed upon","Great Expectations"
"Old Orlick’s daring to admire her; as hot as if it were an outrage on","Great Expectations"
"myself.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“But it makes no difference to you, you know,” said Biddy, calmly.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No, Biddy, it makes no difference to me; only I don’t like it; I don’t","Great Expectations"
"approve of it.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Nor I neither,” said Biddy. “Though _that_ makes no difference to","Great Expectations"
"you.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Exactly,” said I; “but I must tell you I should have no opinion of","Great Expectations"
"you, Biddy, if he danced at you with your own consent.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I kept an eye on Orlick after that night, and, whenever circumstances","Great Expectations"
"were favourable to his dancing at Biddy, got before him to obscure that","Great Expectations"
"demonstration. He had struck root in Joe’s establishment, by reason of","Great Expectations"
"my sister’s sudden fancy for him, or I should have tried to get him","Great Expectations"
"dismissed. He quite understood and reciprocated my good intentions, as","Great Expectations"
"I had reason to know thereafter.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"And now, because my mind was not confused enough before, I complicated","Great Expectations"
"its confusion fifty thousand-fold, by having states and seasons when I","Great Expectations"
"was clear that Biddy was immeasurably better than Estella, and that the","Great Expectations"
"plain honest working life to which I was born had nothing in it to be","Great Expectations"
"ashamed of, but offered me sufficient means of self-respect and","Great Expectations"
"happiness. At those times, I would decide conclusively that my","Great Expectations"
"disaffection to dear old Joe and the forge was gone, and that I was","Great Expectations"
"growing up in a fair way to be partners with Joe and to keep company","Great Expectations"
"with Biddy,—when all in a moment some confounding remembrance of the","Great Expectations"
"Havisham days would fall upon me like a destructive missile, and","Great Expectations"
"scatter my wits again. Scattered wits take a long time picking up; and","Great Expectations"
"often before I had got them well together, they would be dispersed in","Great Expectations"
"all directions by one stray thought, that perhaps after all Miss","Great Expectations"
"Havisham was going to make my fortune when my time was out.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"If my time had run out, it would have left me still at the height of my","Great Expectations"
"perplexities, I dare say. It never did run out, however, but was","Great Expectations"
"brought to a premature end, as I proceed to relate.","Great Expectations"

"Chapter XVIII.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was in the fourth year of my apprenticeship to Joe, and it was a","Great Expectations"
"Saturday night. There was a group assembled round the fire at the Three","Great Expectations"
"Jolly Bargemen, attentive to Mr. Wopsle as he read the newspaper aloud.","Great Expectations"
"Of that group I was one.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"A highly popular murder had been committed, and Mr. Wopsle was imbrued","Great Expectations"
"in blood to the eyebrows. He gloated over every abhorrent adjective in","Great Expectations"
"the description, and identified himself with every witness at the","Great Expectations"
"Inquest. He faintly moaned, “I am done for,” as the victim, and he","Great Expectations"
"barbarously bellowed, “I’ll serve you out,” as the murderer. He gave","Great Expectations"
"the medical testimony, in pointed imitation of our local practitioner;","Great Expectations"
"and he piped and shook, as the aged turnpike-keeper who had heard","Great Expectations"
"blows, to an extent so very paralytic as to suggest a doubt regarding","Great Expectations"
"the mental competency of that witness. The coroner, in Mr. Wopsle’s","Great Expectations"
"hands, became Timon of Athens; the beadle, Coriolanus. He enjoyed","Great Expectations"
"himself thoroughly, and we all enjoyed ourselves, and were delightfully","Great Expectations"
"comfortable. In this cosey state of mind we came to the verdict Wilful","Great Expectations"
"Murder.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Then, and not sooner, I became aware of a strange gentleman leaning","Great Expectations"
"over the back of the settle opposite me, looking on. There was an","Great Expectations"
"expression of contempt on his face, and he bit the side of a great","Great Expectations"
"forefinger as he watched the group of faces.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well!” said the stranger to Mr. Wopsle, when the reading was done,","Great Expectations"
"“you have settled it all to your own satisfaction, I have no doubt?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Everybody started and looked up, as if it were the murderer. He looked","Great Expectations"
"at everybody coldly and sarcastically.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Guilty, of course?” said he. “Out with it. Come!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Sir,” returned Mr. Wopsle, “without having the honour of your","Great Expectations"
"acquaintance, I do say Guilty.” Upon this we all took courage to unite","Great Expectations"
"in a confirmatory murmur.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I know you do,” said the stranger; “I knew you would. I told you so.","Great Expectations"
"But now I’ll ask you a question. Do you know, or do you not know, that","Great Expectations"
"the law of England supposes every man to be innocent, until he is","Great Expectations"
"proved—proved—to be guilty?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Sir,” Mr. Wopsle began to reply, “as an Englishman myself, I—”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Come!” said the stranger, biting his forefinger at him. “Don’t evade","Great Expectations"
"the question. Either you know it, or you don’t know it. Which is it to","Great Expectations"
"be?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He stood with his head on one side and himself on one side, in a","Great Expectations"
"bullying, interrogative manner, and he threw his forefinger at Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Wopsle,—as it were to mark him out—before biting it again.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Now!” said he. “Do you know it, or don’t you know it?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Certainly I know it,” replied Mr. Wopsle.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Certainly you know it. Then why didn’t you say so at first? Now, I’ll","Great Expectations"
"ask you another question,”—taking possession of Mr. Wopsle, as if he","Great Expectations"
"had a right to him,—“_do_ you know that none of these witnesses have","Great Expectations"
"yet been cross-examined?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Wopsle was beginning, “I can only say—” when the stranger stopped","Great Expectations"
"him.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What? You won’t answer the question, yes or no? Now, I’ll try you","Great Expectations"
"again.” Throwing his finger at him again. “Attend to me. Are you aware,","Great Expectations"
"or are you not aware, that none of these witnesses have yet been","Great Expectations"
"cross-examined? Come, I only want one word from you. Yes, or no?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Wopsle hesitated, and we all began to conceive rather a poor","Great Expectations"
"opinion of him.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Come!” said the stranger, “I’ll help you. You don’t deserve help, but","Great Expectations"
"I’ll help you. Look at that paper you hold in your hand. What is it?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What is it?” repeated Mr. Wopsle, eyeing it, much at a loss.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Is it,” pursued the stranger in his most sarcastic and suspicious","Great Expectations"
"manner, “the printed paper you have just been reading from?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Undoubtedly.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Undoubtedly. Now, turn to that paper, and tell me whether it","Great Expectations"
"distinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that his legal","Great Expectations"
"advisers instructed him altogether to reserve his defence?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I read that just now,” Mr. Wopsle pleaded.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Never mind what you read just now, sir; I don’t ask you what you read","Great Expectations"
"just now. You may read the Lord’s Prayer backwards, if you like,—and,","Great Expectations"
"perhaps, have done it before to-day. Turn to the paper. No, no, no my","Great Expectations"
"friend; not to the top of the column; you know better than that; to the","Great Expectations"
"bottom, to the bottom.” (We all began to think Mr. Wopsle full of","Great Expectations"
"subterfuge.) “Well? Have you found it?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Here it is,” said Mr. Wopsle.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Now, follow that passage with your eye, and tell me whether it","Great Expectations"
"distinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that he was","Great Expectations"
"instructed by his legal advisers wholly to reserve his defence? Come!","Great Expectations"
"Do you make that of it?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Wopsle answered, “Those are not the exact words.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Not the exact words!” repeated the gentleman bitterly. “Is that the","Great Expectations"
"exact substance?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes,” said Mr. Wopsle.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes,” repeated the stranger, looking round at the rest of the company","Great Expectations"
"with his right hand extended towards the witness, Wopsle. “And now I","Great Expectations"
"ask you what you say to the conscience of that man who, with that","Great Expectations"
"passage before his eyes, can lay his head upon his pillow after having","Great Expectations"
"pronounced a fellow-creature guilty, unheard?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We all began to suspect that Mr. Wopsle was not the man we had thought","Great Expectations"
"him, and that he was beginning to be found out.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And that same man, remember,” pursued the gentleman, throwing his","Great Expectations"
"finger at Mr. Wopsle heavily,—“that same man might be summoned as a","Great Expectations"
"juryman upon this very trial, and, having thus deeply committed","Great Expectations"
"himself, might return to the bosom of his family and lay his head upon","Great Expectations"
"his pillow, after deliberately swearing that he would well and truly","Great Expectations"
"try the issue joined between Our Sovereign Lord the King and the","Great Expectations"
"prisoner at the bar, and would a true verdict give according to the","Great Expectations"
"evidence, so help him God!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We were all deeply persuaded that the unfortunate Wopsle had gone too","Great Expectations"
"far, and had better stop in his reckless career while there was yet","Great Expectations"
"time.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The strange gentleman, with an air of authority not to be disputed, and","Great Expectations"
"with a manner expressive of knowing something secret about every one of","Great Expectations"
"us that would effectually do for each individual if he chose to","Great Expectations"
"disclose it, left the back of the settle, and came into the space","Great Expectations"
"between the two settles, in front of the fire, where he remained","Great Expectations"
"standing, his left hand in his pocket, and he biting the forefinger of","Great Expectations"
"his right.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“From information I have received,” said he, looking round at us as we","Great Expectations"
"all quailed before him, “I have reason to believe there is a blacksmith","Great Expectations"
"among you, by name Joseph—or Joe—Gargery. Which is the man?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Here is the man,” said Joe.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The strange gentleman beckoned him out of his place, and Joe went.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You have an apprentice,” pursued the stranger, “commonly known as Pip?","Great Expectations"
"Is he here?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I am here!” I cried.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The stranger did not recognise me, but I recognised him as the","Great Expectations"
"gentleman I had met on the stairs, on the occasion of my second visit","Great Expectations"
"to Miss Havisham. I had known him the moment I saw him looking over the","Great Expectations"
"settle, and now that I stood confronting him with his hand upon my","Great Expectations"
"shoulder, I checked off again in detail his large head, his dark","Great Expectations"
"complexion, his deep-set eyes, his bushy black eyebrows, his large","Great Expectations"
"watch-chain, his strong black dots of beard and whisker, and even the","Great Expectations"
"smell of scented soap on his great hand.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I wish to have a private conference with you two,” said he, when he","Great Expectations"
"had surveyed me at his leisure. “It will take a little time. Perhaps we","Great Expectations"
"had better go to your place of residence. I prefer not to anticipate my","Great Expectations"
"communication here; you will impart as much or as little of it as you","Great Expectations"
"please to your friends afterwards; I have nothing to do with that.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Amidst a wondering silence, we three walked out of the Jolly Bargemen,","Great Expectations"
"and in a wondering silence walked home. While going along, the strange","Great Expectations"
"gentleman occasionally looked at me, and occasionally bit the side of","Great Expectations"
"his finger. As we neared home, Joe vaguely acknowledging the occasion","Great Expectations"
"as an impressive and ceremonious one, went on ahead to open the front","Great Expectations"
"door. Our conference was held in the state parlour, which was feebly","Great Expectations"
"lighted by one candle.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It began with the strange gentleman’s sitting down at the table,","Great Expectations"
"drawing the candle to him, and looking over some entries in his","Great Expectations"
"pocket-book. He then put up the pocket-book and set the candle a little","Great Expectations"
"aside, after peering round it into the darkness at Joe and me, to","Great Expectations"
"ascertain which was which.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“My name,” he said, “is Jaggers, and I am a lawyer in London. I am","Great Expectations"
"pretty well known. I have unusual business to transact with you, and I","Great Expectations"
"commence by explaining that it is not of my originating. If my advice","Great Expectations"
"had been asked, I should not have been here. It was not asked, and you","Great Expectations"
"see me here. What I have to do as the confidential agent of another, I","Great Expectations"
"do. No less, no more.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Finding that he could not see us very well from where he sat, he got","Great Expectations"
"up, and threw one leg over the back of a chair and leaned upon it; thus","Great Expectations"
"having one foot on the seat of the chair, and one foot on the ground.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Now, Joseph Gargery, I am the bearer of an offer to relieve you of","Great Expectations"
"this young fellow your apprentice. You would not object to cancel his","Great Expectations"
"indentures at his request and for his good? You would want nothing for","Great Expectations"
"so doing?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Lord forbid that I should want anything for not standing in Pip’s","Great Expectations"
"way,” said Joe, staring.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Lord forbidding is pious, but not to the purpose,” returned Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Jaggers. “The question is, Would you want anything? Do you want","Great Expectations"
"anything?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“The answer is,” returned Joe, sternly, “No.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I thought Mr. Jaggers glanced at Joe, as if he considered him a fool","Great Expectations"
"for his disinterestedness. But I was too much bewildered between","Great Expectations"
"breathless curiosity and surprise, to be sure of it.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Very well,” said Mr. Jaggers. “Recollect the admission you have made,","Great Expectations"
"and don’t try to go from it presently.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Who’s a-going to try?” retorted Joe.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I don’t say anybody is. Do you keep a dog?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, I do keep a dog.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Bear in mind then, that Brag is a good dog, but Holdfast is a better.","Great Expectations"
"Bear that in mind, will you?” repeated Mr. Jaggers, shutting his eyes","Great Expectations"
"and nodding his head at Joe, as if he were forgiving him something.","Great Expectations"
"“Now, I return to this young fellow. And the communication I have got","Great Expectations"
"to make is, that he has great expectations.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Joe and I gasped, and looked at one another.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I am instructed to communicate to him,” said Mr. Jaggers, throwing his","Great Expectations"
"finger at me sideways, “that he will come into a handsome property.","Great Expectations"
"Further, that it is the desire of the present possessor of that","Great Expectations"
"property, that he be immediately removed from his present sphere of","Great Expectations"
"life and from this place, and be brought up as a gentleman,—in a word,","Great Expectations"
"as a young fellow of great expectations.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"My dream was out; my wild fancy was surpassed by sober reality; Miss","Great Expectations"
"Havisham was going to make my fortune on a grand scale.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Now, Mr. Pip,” pursued the lawyer, “I address the rest of what I have","Great Expectations"
"to say, to you. You are to understand, first, that it is the request of","Great Expectations"
"the person from whom I take my instructions that you always bear the","Great Expectations"
"name of Pip. You will have no objection, I dare say, to your great","Great Expectations"
"expectations being encumbered with that easy condition. But if you have","Great Expectations"
"any objection, this is the time to mention it.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"My heart was beating so fast, and there was such a singing in my ears,","Great Expectations"
"that I could scarcely stammer I had no objection.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I should think not! Now you are to understand, secondly, Mr. Pip, that","Great Expectations"
"the name of the person who is your liberal benefactor remains a","Great Expectations"
"profound secret, until the person chooses to reveal it. I am empowered","Great Expectations"
"to mention that it is the intention of the person to reveal it at first","Great Expectations"
"hand by word of mouth to yourself. When or where that intention may be","Great Expectations"
"carried out, I cannot say; no one can say. It may be years hence. Now,","Great Expectations"
"you are distinctly to understand that you are most positively","Great Expectations"
"prohibited from making any inquiry on this head, or any allusion or","Great Expectations"
"reference, however distant, to any individual whomsoever as _the_","Great Expectations"
"individual, in all the communications you may have with me. If you have","Great Expectations"
"a suspicion in your own breast, keep that suspicion in your own breast.","Great Expectations"
"It is not the least to the purpose what the reasons of this prohibition","Great Expectations"
"are; they may be the strongest and gravest reasons, or they may be mere","Great Expectations"
"whim. This is not for you to inquire into. The condition is laid down.","Great Expectations"
"Your acceptance of it, and your observance of it as binding, is the","Great Expectations"
"only remaining condition that I am charged with, by the person from","Great Expectations"
"whom I take my instructions, and for whom I am not otherwise","Great Expectations"
"responsible. That person is the person from whom you derive your","Great Expectations"
"expectations, and the secret is solely held by that person and by me.","Great Expectations"
"Again, not a very difficult condition with which to encumber such a","Great Expectations"
"rise in fortune; but if you have any objection to it, this is the time","Great Expectations"
"to mention it. Speak out.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Once more, I stammered with difficulty that I had no objection.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I should think not! Now, Mr. Pip, I have done with stipulations.”","Great Expectations"
"Though he called me Mr. Pip, and began rather to make up to me, he","Great Expectations"
"still could not get rid of a certain air of bullying suspicion; and","Great Expectations"
"even now he occasionally shut his eyes and threw his finger at me while","Great Expectations"
"he spoke, as much as to express that he knew all kinds of things to my","Great Expectations"
"disparagement, if he only chose to mention them. “We come next, to mere","Great Expectations"
"details of arrangement. You must know that, although I have used the","Great Expectations"
"term ‘expectations’ more than once, you are not endowed with","Great Expectations"
"expectations only. There is already lodged in my hands a sum of money","Great Expectations"
"amply sufficient for your suitable education and maintenance. You will","Great Expectations"
"please consider me your guardian. Oh!” for I was going to thank him, “I","Great Expectations"
"tell you at once, I am paid for my services, or I shouldn’t render","Great Expectations"
"them. It is considered that you must be better educated, in accordance","Great Expectations"
"with your altered position, and that you will be alive to the","Great Expectations"
"importance and necessity of at once entering on that advantage.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I said I had always longed for it.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Never mind what you have always longed for, Mr. Pip,” he retorted;","Great Expectations"
"“keep to the record. If you long for it now, that’s enough. Am I","Great Expectations"
"answered that you are ready to be placed at once under some proper","Great Expectations"
"tutor? Is that it?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I stammered yes, that was it.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Good. Now, your inclinations are to be consulted. I don’t think that","Great Expectations"
"wise, mind, but it’s my trust. Have you ever heard of any tutor whom","Great Expectations"
"you would prefer to another?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I had never heard of any tutor but Biddy and Mr. Wopsle’s great-aunt;","Great Expectations"
"so, I replied in the negative.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“There is a certain tutor, of whom I have some knowledge, who I think","Great Expectations"
"might suit the purpose,” said Mr. Jaggers. “I don’t recommend him,","Great Expectations"
"observe; because I never recommend anybody. The gentleman I speak of is","Great Expectations"
"one Mr. Matthew Pocket.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Ah! I caught at the name directly. Miss Havisham’s relation. The","Great Expectations"
"Matthew whom Mr. and Mrs. Camilla had spoken of. The Matthew whose","Great Expectations"
"place was to be at Miss Havisham’s head, when she lay dead, in her","Great Expectations"
"bride’s dress on the bride’s table.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You know the name?” said Mr. Jaggers, looking shrewdly at me, and then","Great Expectations"
"shutting up his eyes while he waited for my answer.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"My answer was, that I had heard of the name.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Oh!” said he. “You have heard of the name. But the question is, what","Great Expectations"
"do you say of it?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I said, or tried to say, that I was much obliged to him for his","Great Expectations"
"recommendation—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No, my young friend!” he interrupted, shaking his great head very","Great Expectations"
"slowly. “Recollect yourself!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Not recollecting myself, I began again that I was much obliged to him","Great Expectations"
"for his recommendation—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No, my young friend,” he interrupted, shaking his head and frowning","Great Expectations"
"and smiling both at once,—“no, no, no; it’s very well done, but it","Great Expectations"
"won’t do; you are too young to fix me with it. Recommendation is not","Great Expectations"
"the word, Mr. Pip. Try another.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Correcting myself, I said that I was much obliged to him for his","Great Expectations"
"mention of Mr. Matthew Pocket—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“_That_’s more like it!” cried Mr. Jaggers.—And (I added), I would","Great Expectations"
"gladly try that gentleman.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Good. You had better try him in his own house. The way shall be","Great Expectations"
"prepared for you, and you can see his son first, who is in London. When","Great Expectations"
"will you come to London?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I said (glancing at Joe, who stood looking on, motionless), that I","Great Expectations"
"supposed I could come directly.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“First,” said Mr. Jaggers, “you should have some new clothes to come","Great Expectations"
"in, and they should not be working-clothes. Say this day week. You’ll","Great Expectations"
"want some money. Shall I leave you twenty guineas?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He produced a long purse, with the greatest coolness, and counted them","Great Expectations"
"out on the table and pushed them over to me. This was the first time he","Great Expectations"
"had taken his leg from the chair. He sat astride of the chair when he","Great Expectations"
"had pushed the money over, and sat swinging his purse and eyeing Joe.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well, Joseph Gargery? You look dumbfoundered?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I _am_!” said Joe, in a very decided manner.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It was understood that you wanted nothing for yourself, remember?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It were understood,” said Joe. “And it are understood. And it ever","Great Expectations"
"will be similar according.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“But what,” said Mr. Jaggers, swinging his purse,—“what if it was in my","Great Expectations"
"instructions to make you a present, as compensation?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“As compensation what for?” Joe demanded.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“For the loss of his services.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Joe laid his hand upon my shoulder with the touch of a woman. I have","Great Expectations"
"often thought him since, like the steam-hammer that can crush a man or","Great Expectations"
"pat an egg-shell, in his combination of strength with gentleness. “Pip","Great Expectations"
"is that hearty welcome,” said Joe, “to go free with his services, to","Great Expectations"
"honour and fortun’, as no words can tell him. But if you think as Money","Great Expectations"
"can make compensation to me for the loss of the little child—what come","Great Expectations"
"to the forge—and ever the best of friends!—”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"O dear good Joe, whom I was so ready to leave and so unthankful to, I","Great Expectations"
"see you again, with your muscular blacksmith’s arm before your eyes,","Great Expectations"
"and your broad chest heaving, and your voice dying away. O dear good","Great Expectations"
"faithful tender Joe, I feel the loving tremble of your hand upon my","Great Expectations"
"arm, as solemnly this day as if it had been the rustle of an angel’s","Great Expectations"
"wing!","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"But I encouraged Joe at the time. I was lost in the mazes of my future","Great Expectations"
"fortunes, and could not retrace the by-paths we had trodden together. I","Great Expectations"
"begged Joe to be comforted, for (as he said) we had ever been the best","Great Expectations"
"of friends, and (as I said) we ever would be so. Joe scooped his eyes","Great Expectations"
"with his disengaged wrist, as if he were bent on gouging himself, but","Great Expectations"
"said not another word.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Jaggers had looked on at this, as one who recognised in Joe the","Great Expectations"
"village idiot, and in me his keeper. When it was over, he said,","Great Expectations"
"weighing in his hand the purse he had ceased to swing:—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Now, Joseph Gargery, I warn you this is your last chance. No half","Great Expectations"
"measures with me. If you mean to take a present that I have it in","Great Expectations"
"charge to make you, speak out, and you shall have it. If on the","Great Expectations"
"contrary you mean to say—” Here, to his great amazement, he was stopped","Great Expectations"
"by Joe’s suddenly working round him with every demonstration of a fell","Great Expectations"
"pugilistic purpose.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Which I meantersay,” cried Joe, “that if you come into my place","Great Expectations"
"bull-baiting and badgering me, come out! Which I meantersay as sech if","Great Expectations"
"you’re a man, come on! Which I meantersay that what I say, I meantersay","Great Expectations"
"and stand or fall by!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I drew Joe away, and he immediately became placable; merely stating to","Great Expectations"
"me, in an obliging manner and as a polite expostulatory notice to any","Great Expectations"
"one whom it might happen to concern, that he were not a-going to be","Great Expectations"
"bull-baited and badgered in his own place. Mr. Jaggers had risen when","Great Expectations"
"Joe demonstrated, and had backed near the door. Without evincing any","Great Expectations"
"inclination to come in again, he there delivered his valedictory","Great Expectations"
"remarks. They were these.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well, Mr. Pip, I think the sooner you leave here—as you are to be a","Great Expectations"
"gentleman—the better. Let it stand for this day week, and you shall","Great Expectations"
"receive my printed address in the meantime. You can take a","Great Expectations"
"hackney-coach at the stage-coach office in London, and come straight to","Great Expectations"
"me. Understand, that I express no opinion, one way or other, on the","Great Expectations"
"trust I undertake. I am paid for undertaking it, and I do so. Now,","Great Expectations"
"understand that, finally. Understand that!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He was throwing his finger at both of us, and I think would have gone","Great Expectations"
"on, but for his seeming to think Joe dangerous, and going off.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Something came into my head which induced me to run after him, as he","Great Expectations"
"was going down to the Jolly Bargemen, where he had left a hired","Great Expectations"
"carriage.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I beg your pardon, Mr. Jaggers.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Halloa!” said he, facing round, “what’s the matter?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I wish to be quite right, Mr. Jaggers, and to keep to your directions;","Great Expectations"
"so I thought I had better ask. Would there be any objection to my","Great Expectations"
"taking leave of any one I know, about here, before I go away?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No,” said he, looking as if he hardly understood me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I don’t mean in the village only, but up town?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No,” said he. “No objection.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I thanked him and ran home again, and there I found that Joe had","Great Expectations"
"already locked the front door and vacated the state parlour, and was","Great Expectations"
"seated by the kitchen fire with a hand on each knee, gazing intently at","Great Expectations"
"the burning coals. I too sat down before the fire and gazed at the","Great Expectations"
"coals, and nothing was said for a long time.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"My sister was in her cushioned chair in her corner, and Biddy sat at","Great Expectations"
"her needle-work before the fire, and Joe sat next Biddy, and I sat next","Great Expectations"
"Joe in the corner opposite my sister. The more I looked into the","Great Expectations"
"glowing coals, the more incapable I became of looking at Joe; the","Great Expectations"
"longer the silence lasted, the more unable I felt to speak.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"At length I got out, “Joe, have you told Biddy?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No, Pip,” returned Joe, still looking at the fire, and holding his","Great Expectations"
"knees tight, as if he had private information that they intended to","Great Expectations"
"make off somewhere, “which I left it to yourself, Pip.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I would rather you told, Joe.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Pip’s a gentleman of fortun’ then,” said Joe, “and God bless him in","Great Expectations"
"it!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Biddy dropped her work, and looked at me. Joe held his knees and looked","Great Expectations"
"at me. I looked at both of them. After a pause, they both heartily","Great Expectations"
"congratulated me; but there was a certain touch of sadness in their","Great Expectations"
"congratulations that I rather resented.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I took it upon myself to impress Biddy (and through Biddy, Joe) with","Great Expectations"
"the grave obligation I considered my friends under, to know nothing and","Great Expectations"
"say nothing about the maker of my fortune. It would all come out in","Great Expectations"
"good time, I observed, and in the meanwhile nothing was to be said,","Great Expectations"
"save that I had come into great expectations from a mysterious patron.","Great Expectations"
"Biddy nodded her head thoughtfully at the fire as she took up her work","Great Expectations"
"again, and said she would be very particular; and Joe, still detaining","Great Expectations"
"his knees, said, “Ay, ay, I’ll be ekervally partickler, Pip;” and then","Great Expectations"
"they congratulated me again, and went on to express so much wonder at","Great Expectations"
"the notion of my being a gentleman that I didn’t half like it.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Infinite pains were then taken by Biddy to convey to my sister some","Great Expectations"
"idea of what had happened. To the best of my belief, those efforts","Great Expectations"
"entirely failed. She laughed and nodded her head a great many times,","Great Expectations"
"and even repeated after Biddy, the words “Pip” and “Property.” But I","Great Expectations"
"doubt if they had more meaning in them than an election cry, and I","Great Expectations"
"cannot suggest a darker picture of her state of mind.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I never could have believed it without experience, but as Joe and Biddy","Great Expectations"
"became more at their cheerful ease again, I became quite gloomy.","Great Expectations"
"Dissatisfied with my fortune, of course I could not be; but it is","Great Expectations"
"possible that I may have been, without quite knowing it, dissatisfied","Great Expectations"
"with myself.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Anyhow, I sat with my elbow on my knee and my face upon my hand,","Great Expectations"
"looking into the fire, as those two talked about my going away, and","Great Expectations"
"about what they should do without me, and all that. And whenever I","Great Expectations"
"caught one of them looking at me, though never so pleasantly (and they","Great Expectations"
"often looked at me,—particularly Biddy), I felt offended: as if they","Great Expectations"
"were expressing some mistrust of me. Though Heaven knows they never did","Great Expectations"
"by word or sign.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"At those times I would get up and look out at the door; for our kitchen","Great Expectations"
"door opened at once upon the night, and stood open on summer evenings","Great Expectations"
"to air the room. The very stars to which I then raised my eyes, I am","Great Expectations"
"afraid I took to be but poor and humble stars for glittering on the","Great Expectations"
"rustic objects among which I had passed my life.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Saturday night,” said I, when we sat at our supper of bread and cheese","Great Expectations"
"and beer. “Five more days, and then the day before _the_ day! They’ll","Great Expectations"
"soon go.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, Pip,” observed Joe, whose voice sounded hollow in his beer-mug.","Great Expectations"
"“They’ll soon go.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Soon, soon go,” said Biddy.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I have been thinking, Joe, that when I go down town on Monday, and","Great Expectations"
"order my new clothes, I shall tell the tailor that I’ll come and put","Great Expectations"
"them on there, or that I’ll have them sent to Mr. Pumblechook’s. It","Great Expectations"
"would be very disagreeable to be stared at by all the people here.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Mr. and Mrs. Hubble might like to see you in your new gen-teel figure","Great Expectations"
"too, Pip,” said Joe, industriously cutting his bread, with his cheese","Great Expectations"
"on it, in the palm of his left hand, and glancing at my untasted supper","Great Expectations"
"as if he thought of the time when we used to compare slices. “So might","Great Expectations"
"Wopsle. And the Jolly Bargemen might take it as a compliment.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“That’s just what I don’t want, Joe. They would make such a business of","Great Expectations"
"it,—such a coarse and common business,—that I couldn’t bear myself.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Ah, that indeed, Pip!” said Joe. “If you couldn’t abear yourself—”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Biddy asked me here, as she sat holding my sister’s plate, “Have you","Great Expectations"
"thought about when you’ll show yourself to Mr. Gargery, and your sister","Great Expectations"
"and me? You will show yourself to us; won’t you?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Biddy,” I returned with some resentment, “you are so exceedingly quick","Great Expectations"
"that it’s difficult to keep up with you.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"(“She always were quick,” observed Joe.)","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“If you had waited another moment, Biddy, you would have heard me say","Great Expectations"
"that I shall bring my clothes here in a bundle one evening,—most likely","Great Expectations"
"on the evening before I go away.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Biddy said no more. Handsomely forgiving her, I soon exchanged an","Great Expectations"
"affectionate good night with her and Joe, and went up to bed. When I","Great Expectations"
"got into my little room, I sat down and took a long look at it, as a","Great Expectations"
"mean little room that I should soon be parted from and raised above,","Great Expectations"
"for ever. It was furnished with fresh young remembrances too, and even","Great Expectations"
"at the same moment I fell into much the same confused division of mind","Great Expectations"
"between it and the better rooms to which I was going, as I had been in","Great Expectations"
"so often between the forge and Miss Havisham’s, and Biddy and Estella.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The sun had been shining brightly all day on the roof of my attic, and","Great Expectations"
"the room was warm. As I put the window open and stood looking out, I","Great Expectations"
"saw Joe come slowly forth at the dark door, below, and take a turn or","Great Expectations"
"two in the air; and then I saw Biddy come, and bring him a pipe and","Great Expectations"
"light it for him. He never smoked so late, and it seemed to hint to me","Great Expectations"
"that he wanted comforting, for some reason or other.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He presently stood at the door immediately beneath me, smoking his","Great Expectations"
"pipe, and Biddy stood there too, quietly talking to him, and I knew","Great Expectations"
"that they talked of me, for I heard my name mentioned in an endearing","Great Expectations"
"tone by both of them more than once. I would not have listened for","Great Expectations"
"more, if I could have heard more; so I drew away from the window, and","Great Expectations"
"sat down in my one chair by the bedside, feeling it very sorrowful and","Great Expectations"
"strange that this first night of my bright fortunes should be the","Great Expectations"
"loneliest I had ever known.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Looking towards the open window, I saw light wreaths from Joe’s pipe","Great Expectations"
"floating there, and I fancied it was like a blessing from Joe,—not","Great Expectations"
"obtruded on me or paraded before me, but pervading the air we shared","Great Expectations"
"together. I put my light out, and crept into bed; and it was an uneasy","Great Expectations"
"bed now, and I never slept the old sound sleep in it any more.","Great Expectations"

"Chapter XIX.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Morning made a considerable difference in my general prospect of Life,","Great Expectations"
"and brightened it so much that it scarcely seemed the same. What lay","Great Expectations"
"heaviest on my mind was, the consideration that six days intervened","Great Expectations"
"between me and the day of departure; for I could not divest myself of a","Great Expectations"
"misgiving that something might happen to London in the meanwhile, and","Great Expectations"
"that, when I got there, it would be either greatly deteriorated or","Great Expectations"
"clean gone.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Joe and Biddy were very sympathetic and pleasant when I spoke of our","Great Expectations"
"approaching separation; but they only referred to it when I did. After","Great Expectations"
"breakfast, Joe brought out my indentures from the press in the best","Great Expectations"
"parlour, and we put them in the fire, and I felt that I was free. With","Great Expectations"
"all the novelty of my emancipation on me, I went to church with Joe,","Great Expectations"
"and thought perhaps the clergyman wouldn’t have read that about the","Great Expectations"
"rich man and the kingdom of Heaven, if he had known all.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"After our early dinner, I strolled out alone, purposing to finish off","Great Expectations"
"the marshes at once, and get them done with. As I passed the church, I","Great Expectations"
"felt (as I had felt during service in the morning) a sublime compassion","Great Expectations"
"for the poor creatures who were destined to go there, Sunday after","Great Expectations"
"Sunday, all their lives through, and to lie obscurely at last among the","Great Expectations"
"low green mounds. I promised myself that I would do something for them","Great Expectations"
"one of these days, and formed a plan in outline for bestowing a dinner","Great Expectations"
"of roast-beef and plum-pudding, a pint of ale, and a gallon of","Great Expectations"
"condescension, upon everybody in the village.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"If I had often thought before, with something allied to shame, of my","Great Expectations"
"companionship with the fugitive whom I had once seen limping among","Great Expectations"
"those graves, what were my thoughts on this Sunday, when the place","Great Expectations"
"recalled the wretch, ragged and shivering, with his felon iron and","Great Expectations"
"badge! My comfort was, that it happened a long time ago, and that he","Great Expectations"
"had doubtless been transported a long way off, and that he was dead to","Great Expectations"
"me, and might be veritably dead into the bargain.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"No more low, wet grounds, no more dikes and sluices, no more of these","Great Expectations"
"grazing cattle,—though they seemed, in their dull manner, to wear a","Great Expectations"
"more respectful air now, and to face round, in order that they might","Great Expectations"
"stare as long as possible at the possessor of such great","Great Expectations"
"expectations,—farewell, monotonous acquaintances of my childhood,","Great Expectations"
"henceforth I was for London and greatness; not for smith’s work in","Great Expectations"
"general, and for you! I made my exultant way to the old Battery, and,","Great Expectations"
"lying down there to consider the question whether Miss Havisham","Great Expectations"
"intended me for Estella, fell asleep.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"When I awoke, I was much surprised to find Joe sitting beside me,","Great Expectations"
"smoking his pipe. He greeted me with a cheerful smile on my opening my","Great Expectations"
"eyes, and said,—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“As being the last time, Pip, I thought I’d foller.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And Joe, I am very glad you did so.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Thankee, Pip.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You may be sure, dear Joe,” I went on, after we had shaken hands,","Great Expectations"
"“that I shall never forget you.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No, no, Pip!” said Joe, in a comfortable tone, “_I_’m sure of that.","Great Expectations"
"Ay, ay, old chap! Bless you, it were only necessary to get it well","Great Expectations"
"round in a man’s mind, to be certain on it. But it took a bit of time","Great Expectations"
"to get it well round, the change come so oncommon plump; didn’t it?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Somehow, I was not best pleased with Joe’s being so mightily secure of","Great Expectations"
"me. I should have liked him to have betrayed emotion, or to have said,","Great Expectations"
"“It does you credit, Pip,” or something of that sort. Therefore, I made","Great Expectations"
"no remark on Joe’s first head; merely saying as to his second, that the","Great Expectations"
"tidings had indeed come suddenly, but that I had always wanted to be a","Great Expectations"
"gentleman, and had often and often speculated on what I would do, if I","Great Expectations"
"were one.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Have you though?” said Joe. “Astonishing!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It’s a pity now, Joe,” said I, “that you did not get on a little more,","Great Expectations"
"when we had our lessons here; isn’t it?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well, I don’t know,” returned Joe. “I’m so awful dull. I’m only master","Great Expectations"
"of my own trade. It were always a pity as I was so awful dull; but it’s","Great Expectations"
"no more of a pity now, than it was—this day twelvemonth—don’t you see?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"What I had meant was, that when I came into my property and was able to","Great Expectations"
"do something for Joe, it would have been much more agreeable if he had","Great Expectations"
"been better qualified for a rise in station. He was so perfectly","Great Expectations"
"innocent of my meaning, however, that I thought I would mention it to","Great Expectations"
"Biddy in preference.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"So, when we had walked home and had had tea, I took Biddy into our","Great Expectations"
"little garden by the side of the lane, and, after throwing out in a","Great Expectations"
"general way for the elevation of her spirits, that I should never","Great Expectations"
"forget her, said I had a favour to ask of her.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And it is, Biddy,” said I, “that you will not omit any opportunity of","Great Expectations"
"helping Joe on, a little.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“How helping him on?” asked Biddy, with a steady sort of glance.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well! Joe is a dear good fellow,—in fact, I think he is the dearest","Great Expectations"
"fellow that ever lived,—but he is rather backward in some things. For","Great Expectations"
"instance, Biddy, in his learning and his manners.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Although I was looking at Biddy as I spoke, and although she opened her","Great Expectations"
"eyes very wide when I had spoken, she did not look at me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“O, his manners! won’t his manners do then?” asked Biddy, plucking a","Great Expectations"
"black-currant leaf.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“My dear Biddy, they do very well here—”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“O! they _do_ very well here?” interrupted Biddy, looking closely at","Great Expectations"
"the leaf in her hand.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Hear me out,—but if I were to remove Joe into a higher sphere, as I","Great Expectations"
"shall hope to remove him when I fully come into my property, they would","Great Expectations"
"hardly do him justice.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And don’t you think he knows that?” asked Biddy.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was such a very provoking question (for it had never in the most","Great Expectations"
"distant manner occurred to me), that I said, snappishly,—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Biddy, what do you mean?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Biddy, having rubbed the leaf to pieces between her hands,—and the","Great Expectations"
"smell of a black-currant bush has ever since recalled to me that","Great Expectations"
"evening in the little garden by the side of the lane,—said, “Have you","Great Expectations"
"never considered that he may be proud?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Proud?” I repeated, with disdainful emphasis.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“O! there are many kinds of pride,” said Biddy, looking full at me and","Great Expectations"
"shaking her head; “pride is not all of one kind—”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well? What are you stopping for?” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Not all of one kind,” resumed Biddy. “He may be too proud to let any","Great Expectations"
"one take him out of a place that he is competent to fill, and fills","Great Expectations"
"well and with respect. To tell you the truth, I think he is; though it","Great Expectations"
"sounds bold in me to say so, for you must know him far better than I","Great Expectations"
"do.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Now, Biddy,” said I, “I am very sorry to see this in you. I did not","Great Expectations"
"expect to see this in you. You are envious, Biddy, and grudging. You","Great Expectations"
"are dissatisfied on account of my rise in fortune, and you can’t help","Great Expectations"
"showing it.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“If you have the heart to think so,” returned Biddy, “say so. Say so","Great Expectations"
"over and over again, if you have the heart to think so.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“If you have the heart to be so, you mean, Biddy,” said I, in a","Great Expectations"
"virtuous and superior tone; “don’t put it off upon me. I am very sorry","Great Expectations"
"to see it, and it’s a—it’s a bad side of human nature. I did intend to","Great Expectations"
"ask you to use any little opportunities you might have after I was","Great Expectations"
"gone, of improving dear Joe. But after this I ask you nothing. I am","Great Expectations"
"extremely sorry to see this in you, Biddy,” I repeated. “It’s a—it’s a","Great Expectations"
"bad side of human nature.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Whether you scold me or approve of me,” returned poor Biddy, “you may","Great Expectations"
"equally depend upon my trying to do all that lies in my power, here, at","Great Expectations"
"all times. And whatever opinion you take away of me, shall make no","Great Expectations"
"difference in my remembrance of you. Yet a gentleman should not be","Great Expectations"
"unjust neither,” said Biddy, turning away her head.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I again warmly repeated that it was a bad side of human nature (in","Great Expectations"
"which sentiment, waiving its application, I have since seen reason to","Great Expectations"
"think I was right), and I walked down the little path away from Biddy,","Great Expectations"
"and Biddy went into the house, and I went out at the garden gate and","Great Expectations"
"took a dejected stroll until supper-time; again feeling it very","Great Expectations"
"sorrowful and strange that this, the second night of my bright","Great Expectations"
"fortunes, should be as lonely and unsatisfactory as the first.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"But, morning once more brightened my view, and I extended my clemency","Great Expectations"
"to Biddy, and we dropped the subject. Putting on the best clothes I","Great Expectations"
"had, I went into town as early as I could hope to find the shops open,","Great Expectations"
"and presented myself before Mr. Trabb, the tailor, who was having his","Great Expectations"
"breakfast in the parlour behind his shop, and who did not think it","Great Expectations"
"worth his while to come out to me, but called me in to him.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well!” said Mr. Trabb, in a hail-fellow-well-met kind of way. “How are","Great Expectations"
"you, and what can I do for you?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Trabb had sliced his hot roll into three feather-beds, and was","Great Expectations"
"slipping butter in between the blankets, and covering it up. He was a","Great Expectations"
"prosperous old bachelor, and his open window looked into a prosperous","Great Expectations"
"little garden and orchard, and there was a prosperous iron safe let","Great Expectations"
"into the wall at the side of his fireplace, and I did not doubt that","Great Expectations"
"heaps of his prosperity were put away in it in bags.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Mr. Trabb,” said I, “it’s an unpleasant thing to have to mention,","Great Expectations"
"because it looks like boasting; but I have come into a handsome","Great Expectations"
"property.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"A change passed over Mr. Trabb. He forgot the butter in bed, got up","Great Expectations"
"from the bedside, and wiped his fingers on the tablecloth, exclaiming,","Great Expectations"
"“Lord bless my soul!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I am going up to my guardian in London,” said I, casually drawing some","Great Expectations"
"guineas out of my pocket and looking at them; “and I want a fashionable","Great Expectations"
"suit of clothes to go in. I wish to pay for them,” I added—otherwise I","Great Expectations"
"thought he might only pretend to make them, “with ready money.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“My dear sir,” said Mr. Trabb, as he respectfully bent his body, opened","Great Expectations"
"his arms, and took the liberty of touching me on the outside of each","Great Expectations"
"elbow, “don’t hurt me by mentioning that. May I venture to congratulate","Great Expectations"
"you? Would you do me the favour of stepping into the shop?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Trabb’s boy was the most audacious boy in all that country-side.","Great Expectations"
"When I had entered he was sweeping the shop, and he had sweetened his","Great Expectations"
"labours by sweeping over me. He was still sweeping when I came out into","Great Expectations"
"the shop with Mr. Trabb, and he knocked the broom against all possible","Great Expectations"
"corners and obstacles, to express (as I understood it) equality with","Great Expectations"
"any blacksmith, alive or dead.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Hold that noise,” said Mr. Trabb, with the greatest sternness, “or","Great Expectations"
"I’ll knock your head off!—Do me the favour to be seated, sir. Now,","Great Expectations"
"this,” said Mr. Trabb, taking down a roll of cloth, and tiding it out","Great Expectations"
"in a flowing manner over the counter, preparatory to getting his hand","Great Expectations"
"under it to show the gloss, “is a very sweet article. I can recommend","Great Expectations"
"it for your purpose, sir, because it really is extra super. But you","Great Expectations"
"shall see some others. Give me Number Four, you!” (To the boy, and with","Great Expectations"
"a dreadfully severe stare; foreseeing the danger of that miscreant’s","Great Expectations"
"brushing me with it, or making some other sign of familiarity.)","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Trabb never removed his stern eye from the boy until he had","Great Expectations"
"deposited number four on the counter and was at a safe distance again.","Great Expectations"
"Then he commanded him to bring number five, and number eight. “And let","Great Expectations"
"me have none of your tricks here,” said Mr. Trabb, “or you shall repent","Great Expectations"
"it, you young scoundrel, the longest day you have to live.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Trabb then bent over number four, and in a sort of deferential","Great Expectations"
"confidence recommended it to me as a light article for summer wear, an","Great Expectations"
"article much in vogue among the nobility and gentry, an article that it","Great Expectations"
"would ever be an honour to him to reflect upon a distinguished","Great Expectations"
"fellow-townsman’s (if he might claim me for a fellow-townsman) having","Great Expectations"
"worn. “Are you bringing numbers five and eight, you vagabond,” said Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Trabb to the boy after that, “or shall I kick you out of the shop and","Great Expectations"
"bring them myself?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I selected the materials for a suit, with the assistance of Mr. Trabb’s","Great Expectations"
"judgment, and re-entered the parlour to be measured. For although Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Trabb had my measure already, and had previously been quite contented","Great Expectations"
"with it, he said apologetically that it “wouldn’t do under existing","Great Expectations"
"circumstances, sir,—wouldn’t do at all.” So, Mr. Trabb measured and","Great Expectations"
"calculated me in the parlour, as if I were an estate and he the finest","Great Expectations"
"species of surveyor, and gave himself such a world of trouble that I","Great Expectations"
"felt that no suit of clothes could possibly remunerate him for his","Great Expectations"
"pains. When he had at last done and had appointed to send the articles","Great Expectations"
"to Mr. Pumblechook’s on the Thursday evening, he said, with his hand","Great Expectations"
"upon the parlour lock, “I know, sir, that London gentlemen cannot be","Great Expectations"
"expected to patronise local work, as a rule; but if you would give me a","Great Expectations"
"turn now and then in the quality of a townsman, I should greatly esteem","Great Expectations"
"it. Good-morning, sir, much obliged.—Door!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The last word was flung at the boy, who had not the least notion what","Great Expectations"
"it meant. But I saw him collapse as his master rubbed me out with his","Great Expectations"
"hands, and my first decided experience of the stupendous power of money","Great Expectations"
"was, that it had morally laid upon his back Trabb’s boy.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"After this memorable event, I went to the hatter’s, and the","Great Expectations"
"bootmaker’s, and the hosier’s, and felt rather like Mother Hubbard’s","Great Expectations"
"dog whose outfit required the services of so many trades. I also went","Great Expectations"
"to the coach-office and took my place for seven o’clock on Saturday","Great Expectations"
"morning. It was not necessary to explain everywhere that I had come","Great Expectations"
"into a handsome property; but whenever I said anything to that effect,","Great Expectations"
"it followed that the officiating tradesman ceased to have his attention","Great Expectations"
"diverted through the window by the High Street, and concentrated his","Great Expectations"
"mind upon me. When I had ordered everything I wanted, I directed my","Great Expectations"
"steps towards Pumblechook’s, and, as I approached that gentleman’s","Great Expectations"
"place of business, I saw him standing at his door.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He was waiting for me with great impatience. He had been out early with","Great Expectations"
"the chaise-cart, and had called at the forge and heard the news. He had","Great Expectations"
"prepared a collation for me in the Barnwell parlour, and he too ordered","Great Expectations"
"his shopman to “come out of the gangway” as my sacred person passed.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“My dear friend,” said Mr. Pumblechook, taking me by both hands, when","Great Expectations"
"he and I and the collation were alone, “I give you joy of your good","Great Expectations"
"fortune. Well deserved, well deserved!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"This was coming to the point, and I thought it a sensible way of","Great Expectations"
"expressing himself.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“To think,” said Mr. Pumblechook, after snorting admiration at me for","Great Expectations"
"some moments, “that I should have been the humble instrument of leading","Great Expectations"
"up to this, is a proud reward.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I begged Mr. Pumblechook to remember that nothing was to be ever said","Great Expectations"
"or hinted, on that point.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“My dear young friend,” said Mr. Pumblechook; “if you will allow me to","Great Expectations"
"call you so—”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I murmured “Certainly,” and Mr. Pumblechook took me by both hands","Great Expectations"
"again, and communicated a movement to his waistcoat, which had an","Great Expectations"
"emotional appearance, though it was rather low down, “My dear young","Great Expectations"
"friend, rely upon my doing my little all in your absence, by keeping","Great Expectations"
"the fact before the mind of Joseph.—Joseph!” said Mr. Pumblechook, in","Great Expectations"
"the way of a compassionate adjuration. “Joseph!! Joseph!!!” Thereupon","Great Expectations"
"he shook his head and tapped it, expressing his sense of deficiency in","Great Expectations"
"Joseph.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“But my dear young friend,” said Mr. Pumblechook, “you must be hungry,","Great Expectations"
"you must be exhausted. Be seated. Here is a chicken had round from the","Great Expectations"
"Boar, here is a tongue had round from the Boar, here’s one or two","Great Expectations"
"little things had round from the Boar, that I hope you may not despise.","Great Expectations"
"But do I,” said Mr. Pumblechook, getting up again the moment after he","Great Expectations"
"had sat down, “see afore me, him as I ever sported with in his times of","Great Expectations"
"happy infancy? And may I—_may_ I—?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"This May I, meant might he shake hands? I consented, and he was","Great Expectations"
"fervent, and then sat down again.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Here is wine,” said Mr. Pumblechook. “Let us drink, Thanks to Fortune,","Great Expectations"
"and may she ever pick out her favourites with equal judgment! And yet I","Great Expectations"
"cannot,” said Mr. Pumblechook, getting up again, “see afore me One—and","Great Expectations"
"likewise drink to One—without again expressing—May I—_may_ I—?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I said he might, and he shook hands with me again, and emptied his","Great Expectations"
"glass and turned it upside down. I did the same; and if I had turned","Great Expectations"
"myself upside down before drinking, the wine could not have gone more","Great Expectations"
"direct to my head.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Pumblechook helped me to the liver wing, and to the best slice of","Great Expectations"
"tongue (none of those out-of-the-way No Thoroughfares of Pork now), and","Great Expectations"
"took, comparatively speaking, no care of himself at all. “Ah! poultry,","Great Expectations"
"poultry! You little thought,” said Mr. Pumblechook, apostrophising the","Great Expectations"
"fowl in the dish, “when you was a young fledgling, what was in store","Great Expectations"
"for you. You little thought you was to be refreshment beneath this","Great Expectations"
"humble roof for one as—Call it a weakness, if you will,” said Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Pumblechook, getting up again, “but may I? _may_ I—?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It began to be unnecessary to repeat the form of saying he might, so he","Great Expectations"
"did it at once. How he ever did it so often without wounding himself","Great Expectations"
"with my knife, I don’t know.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And your sister,” he resumed, after a little steady eating, “which had","Great Expectations"
"the honour of bringing you up by hand! It’s a sad picter, to reflect","Great Expectations"
"that she’s no longer equal to fully understanding the honour. May—”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I saw he was about to come at me again, and I stopped him.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“We’ll drink her health,” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Ah!” cried Mr. Pumblechook, leaning back in his chair, quite flaccid","Great Expectations"
"with admiration, “that’s the way you know ’em, sir!” (I don’t know who","Great Expectations"
"Sir was, but he certainly was not I, and there was no third person","Great Expectations"
"present); “that’s the way you know the noble-minded, sir! Ever","Great Expectations"
"forgiving and ever affable. It might,” said the servile Pumblechook,","Great Expectations"
"putting down his untasted glass in a hurry and getting up again, “to a","Great Expectations"
"common person, have the appearance of repeating—but _may_ I—?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"When he had done it, he resumed his seat and drank to my sister. “Let","Great Expectations"
"us never be blind,” said Mr. Pumblechook, “to her faults of temper, but","Great Expectations"
"it is to be hoped she meant well.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"At about this time, I began to observe that he was getting flushed in","Great Expectations"
"the face; as to myself, I felt all face, steeped in wine and smarting.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I mentioned to Mr. Pumblechook that I wished to have my new clothes","Great Expectations"
"sent to his house, and he was ecstatic on my so distinguishing him. I","Great Expectations"
"mentioned my reason for desiring to avoid observation in the village,","Great Expectations"
"and he lauded it to the skies. There was nobody but himself, he","Great Expectations"
"intimated, worthy of my confidence, and—in short, might he? Then he","Great Expectations"
"asked me tenderly if I remembered our boyish games at sums, and how we","Great Expectations"
"had gone together to have me bound apprentice, and, in effect, how he","Great Expectations"
"had ever been my favourite fancy and my chosen friend? If I had taken","Great Expectations"
"ten times as many glasses of wine as I had, I should have known that he","Great Expectations"
"never had stood in that relation towards me, and should in my heart of","Great Expectations"
"hearts have repudiated the idea. Yet for all that, I remember feeling","Great Expectations"
"convinced that I had been much mistaken in him, and that he was a","Great Expectations"
"sensible, practical, good-hearted prime fellow.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"By degrees he fell to reposing such great confidence in me, as to ask","Great Expectations"
"my advice in reference to his own affairs. He mentioned that there was","Great Expectations"
"an opportunity for a great amalgamation and monopoly of the corn and","Great Expectations"
"seed trade on those premises, if enlarged, such as had never occurred","Great Expectations"
"before in that or any other neighbourhood. What alone was wanting to","Great Expectations"
"the realisation of a vast fortune, he considered to be More Capital.","Great Expectations"
"Those were the two little words, more capital. Now it appeared to him","Great Expectations"
"(Pumblechook) that if that capital were got into the business, through","Great Expectations"
"a sleeping partner, sir,—which sleeping partner would have nothing to","Great Expectations"
"do but walk in, by self or deputy, whenever he pleased, and examine the","Great Expectations"
"books,—and walk in twice a year and take his profits away in his","Great Expectations"
"pocket, to the tune of fifty per cent,—it appeared to him that that","Great Expectations"
"might be an opening for a young gentleman of spirit combined with","Great Expectations"
"property, which would be worthy of his attention. But what did I think?","Great Expectations"
"He had great confidence in my opinion, and what did I think? I gave it","Great Expectations"
"as my opinion. “Wait a bit!” The united vastness and distinctness of","Great Expectations"
"this view so struck him, that he no longer asked if he might shake","Great Expectations"
"hands with me, but said he really must,—and did.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We drank all the wine, and Mr. Pumblechook pledged himself over and","Great Expectations"
"over again to keep Joseph up to the mark (I don’t know what mark), and","Great Expectations"
"to render me efficient and constant service (I don’t know what","Great Expectations"
"service). He also made known to me for the first time in my life, and","Great Expectations"
"certainly after having kept his secret wonderfully well, that he had","Great Expectations"
"always said of me, “That boy is no common boy, and mark me, his fortun’","Great Expectations"
"will be no common fortun’.” He said with a tearful smile that it was a","Great Expectations"
"singular thing to think of now, and I said so too. Finally, I went out","Great Expectations"
"into the air, with a dim perception that there was something unwonted","Great Expectations"
"in the conduct of the sunshine, and found that I had slumberously got","Great Expectations"
"to the turnpike without having taken any account of the road.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"There, I was roused by Mr. Pumblechook’s hailing me. He was a long way","Great Expectations"
"down the sunny street, and was making expressive gestures for me to","Great Expectations"
"stop. I stopped, and he came up breathless.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No, my dear friend,” said he, when he had recovered wind for speech.","Great Expectations"
"“Not if I can help it. This occasion shall not entirely pass without","Great Expectations"
"that affability on your part.—May I, as an old friend and well-wisher?","Great Expectations"
"_May_ I?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We shook hands for the hundredth time at least, and he ordered a young","Great Expectations"
"carter out of my way with the greatest indignation. Then, he blessed me","Great Expectations"
"and stood waving his hand to me until I had passed the crook in the","Great Expectations"
"road; and then I turned into a field and had a long nap under a hedge","Great Expectations"
"before I pursued my way home.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I had scant luggage to take with me to London, for little of the little","Great Expectations"
"I possessed was adapted to my new station. But I began packing that","Great Expectations"
"same afternoon, and wildly packed up things that I knew I should want","Great Expectations"
"next morning, in a fiction that there was not a moment to be lost.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"So, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, passed; and on Friday morning I","Great Expectations"
"went to Mr. Pumblechook’s, to put on my new clothes and pay my visit to","Great Expectations"
"Miss Havisham. Mr. Pumblechook’s own room was given up to me to dress","Great Expectations"
"in, and was decorated with clean towels expressly for the event. My","Great Expectations"
"clothes were rather a disappointment, of course. Probably every new and","Great Expectations"
"eagerly expected garment ever put on since clothes came in, fell a","Great Expectations"
"trifle short of the wearer’s expectation. But after I had had my new","Great Expectations"
"suit on some half an hour, and had gone through an immensity of","Great Expectations"
"posturing with Mr. Pumblechook’s very limited dressing-glass, in the","Great Expectations"
"futile endeavour to see my legs, it seemed to fit me better. It being","Great Expectations"
"market morning at a neighbouring town some ten miles off, Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Pumblechook was not at home. I had not told him exactly when I meant to","Great Expectations"
"leave, and was not likely to shake hands with him again before","Great Expectations"
"departing. This was all as it should be, and I went out in my new","Great Expectations"
"array, fearfully ashamed of having to pass the shopman, and suspicious","Great Expectations"
"after all that I was at a personal disadvantage, something like Joe’s","Great Expectations"
"in his Sunday suit.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I went circuitously to Miss Havisham’s by all the back ways, and rang","Great Expectations"
"at the bell constrainedly, on account of the stiff long fingers of my","Great Expectations"
"gloves. Sarah Pocket came to the gate, and positively reeled back when","Great Expectations"
"she saw me so changed; her walnut-shell countenance likewise turned","Great Expectations"
"from brown to green and yellow.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You?” said she. “You? Good gracious! What do you want?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I am going to London, Miss Pocket,” said I, “and want to say good-bye","Great Expectations"
"to Miss Havisham.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I was not expected, for she left me locked in the yard, while she went","Great Expectations"
"to ask if I were to be admitted. After a very short delay, she returned","Great Expectations"
"and took me up, staring at me all the way.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Miss Havisham was taking exercise in the room with the long spread","Great Expectations"
"table, leaning on her crutch stick. The room was lighted as of yore,","Great Expectations"
"and at the sound of our entrance, she stopped and turned. She was then","Great Expectations"
"just abreast of the rotted bride-cake.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Don’t go, Sarah,” she said. “Well, Pip?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I start for London, Miss Havisham, to-morrow,” I was exceedingly","Great Expectations"
"careful what I said, “and I thought you would kindly not mind my taking","Great Expectations"
"leave of you.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“This is a gay figure, Pip,” said she, making her crutch stick play","Great Expectations"
"round me, as if she, the fairy godmother who had changed me, were","Great Expectations"
"bestowing the finishing gift.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I have come into such good fortune since I saw you last, Miss","Great Expectations"
"Havisham,” I murmured. “And I am so grateful for it, Miss Havisham!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Ay, ay!” said she, looking at the discomfited and envious Sarah, with","Great Expectations"
"delight. “I have seen Mr. Jaggers. _I_ have heard about it, Pip. So you","Great Expectations"
"go to-morrow?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, Miss Havisham.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And you are adopted by a rich person?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, Miss Havisham.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Not named?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No, Miss Havisham.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And Mr. Jaggers is made your guardian?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, Miss Havisham.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"She quite gloated on these questions and answers, so keen was her","Great Expectations"
"enjoyment of Sarah Pocket’s jealous dismay. “Well!” she went on; “you","Great Expectations"
"have a promising career before you. Be good—deserve it—and abide by Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Jaggers’s instructions.” She looked at me, and looked at Sarah, and","Great Expectations"
"Sarah’s countenance wrung out of her watchful face a cruel smile.","Great Expectations"
"“Good-bye, Pip!—you will always keep the name of Pip, you know.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, Miss Havisham.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Good-bye, Pip!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"She stretched out her hand, and I went down on my knee and put it to my","Great Expectations"
"lips. I had not considered how I should take leave of her; it came","Great Expectations"
"naturally to me at the moment to do this. She looked at Sarah Pocket","Great Expectations"
"with triumph in her weird eyes, and so I left my fairy godmother, with","Great Expectations"
"both her hands on her crutch stick, standing in the midst of the dimly","Great Expectations"
"lighted room beside the rotten bride-cake that was hidden in cobwebs.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Sarah Pocket conducted me down, as if I were a ghost who must be seen","Great Expectations"
"out. She could not get over my appearance, and was in the last degree","Great Expectations"
"confounded. I said “Good-bye, Miss Pocket;” but she merely stared, and","Great Expectations"
"did not seem collected enough to know that I had spoken. Clear of the","Great Expectations"
"house, I made the best of my way back to Pumblechook’s, took off my new","Great Expectations"
"clothes, made them into a bundle, and went back home in my older dress,","Great Expectations"
"carrying it—to speak the truth—much more at my ease too, though I had","Great Expectations"
"the bundle to carry.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"And now, those six days which were to have run out so slowly, had run","Great Expectations"
"out fast and were gone, and to-morrow looked me in the face more","Great Expectations"
"steadily than I could look at it. As the six evenings had dwindled","Great Expectations"
"away, to five, to four, to three, to two, I had become more and more","Great Expectations"
"appreciative of the society of Joe and Biddy. On this last evening, I","Great Expectations"
"dressed myself out in my new clothes for their delight, and sat in my","Great Expectations"
"splendour	 until bedtime. We had a hot supper on the occasion,","Great Expectations"
"graced by the inevitable roast fowl, and we had some flip to finish","Great Expectations"
"with. We were all very low, and none the higher for pretending to be in","Great Expectations"
"spirits.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I was to leave our village at five in the morning, carrying my little","Great Expectations"
"hand-portmanteau, and I had told Joe that I wished to walk away all","Great Expectations"
"alone. I am afraid—sore afraid—that this purpose originated in my sense","Great Expectations"
"of the contrast there would be between me and Joe, if we went to the","Great Expectations"
"coach together. I had pretended with myself that there was nothing of","Great Expectations"
"this taint in the arrangement; but when I went up to my little room on","Great Expectations"
"this last night, I felt compelled to admit that it might be so, and had","Great Expectations"
"an impulse upon me to go down again and entreat Joe to walk with me in","Great Expectations"
"the morning. I did not.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"All night there were coaches in my broken sleep, going to wrong places","Great Expectations"
"instead of to London, and having in the traces, now dogs, now cats, now","Great Expectations"
"pigs, now men,—never horses. Fantastic failures of journeys occupied me","Great Expectations"
"until the day dawned and the birds were singing. Then, I got up and","Great Expectations"
"partly dressed, and sat at the window to take a last look out, and in","Great Expectations"
"taking it fell asleep.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Biddy was astir so early to get my breakfast, that, although I did not","Great Expectations"
"sleep at the window an hour, I smelt the smoke of the kitchen fire when","Great Expectations"
"I started up with a terrible idea that it must be late in the","Great Expectations"
"afternoon. But long after that, and long after I had heard the clinking","Great Expectations"
"of the teacups and was quite ready, I wanted the resolution to go","Great Expectations"
"downstairs. After all, I remained up there, repeatedly unlocking and","Great Expectations"
"unstrapping my small portmanteau and locking and strapping it up again,","Great Expectations"
"until Biddy called to me that I was late.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was a hurried breakfast with no taste in it. I got up from the meal,","Great Expectations"
"saying with a sort of briskness, as if it had only just occurred to me,","Great Expectations"
"“Well! I suppose I must be off!” and then I kissed my sister who was","Great Expectations"
"laughing and nodding and shaking in her usual chair, and kissed Biddy,","Great Expectations"
"and threw my arms around Joe’s neck. Then I took up my little","Great Expectations"
"portmanteau and walked out. The last I saw of them was, when I","Great Expectations"
"presently heard a scuffle behind me, and looking back, saw Joe throwing","Great Expectations"
"an old shoe after me and Biddy throwing another old shoe. I stopped","Great Expectations"
"then, to wave my hat, and dear old Joe waved his strong right arm above","Great Expectations"
"his head, crying huskily “Hooroar!” and Biddy put her apron to her","Great Expectations"
"face.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I walked away at a good pace, thinking it was easier to go than I had","Great Expectations"
"supposed it would be, and reflecting that it would never have done to","Great Expectations"
"have had an old shoe thrown after the coach, in sight of all the High","Great Expectations"
"Street. I whistled and made nothing of going. But the village was very","Great Expectations"
"peaceful and quiet, and the light mists were solemnly rising, as if to","Great Expectations"
"show me the world, and I had been so innocent and little there, and all","Great Expectations"
"beyond was so unknown and great, that in a moment with a strong heave","Great Expectations"
"and sob I broke into tears. It was by the finger-post at the end of the","Great Expectations"
"village, and I laid my hand upon it, and said, “Good-bye, O my dear,","Great Expectations"
"dear friend!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Heaven knows we need never be ashamed of our tears, for they are rain","Great Expectations"
"upon the blinding dust of earth, overlying our hard hearts. I was","Great Expectations"
"better after I had cried than before,—more sorry, more aware of my own","Great Expectations"
"ingratitude, more gentle. If I had cried before, I should have had Joe","Great Expectations"
"with me then.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"So subdued I was by those tears, and by their breaking out again in the","Great Expectations"
"course of the quiet walk, that when I was on the coach, and it was","Great Expectations"
"clear of the town, I deliberated with an aching heart whether I would","Great Expectations"
"not get down when we changed horses and walk back, and have another","Great Expectations"
"evening at home, and a better parting. We changed, and I had not made","Great Expectations"
"up my mind, and still reflected for my comfort that it would be quite","Great Expectations"
"practicable to get down and walk back, when we changed again. And while","Great Expectations"
"I was occupied with these deliberations, I would fancy an exact","Great Expectations"
"resemblance to Joe in some man coming along the road towards us, and my","Great Expectations"
"heart would beat high.—As if he could possibly be there!","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We changed again, and yet again, and it was now too late and too far to","Great Expectations"
"go back, and I went on. And the mists had all solemnly risen now, and","Great Expectations"
"the world lay spread before me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"This is the end of the first stage of Pip’s expectations.","Great Expectations"

"Chapter XX.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The journey from our town to the metropolis was a journey of about five","Great Expectations"
"hours. It was a little past midday when the four-horse stage-coach by","Great Expectations"
"which I was a passenger, got into the ravel of traffic frayed out about","Great Expectations"
"the Cross Keys, Wood Street, Cheapside, London.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We Britons had at that time particularly settled that it was","Great Expectations"
"treasonable to doubt our having and our being the best of everything:","Great Expectations"
"otherwise, while I was scared by the immensity of London, I think I","Great Expectations"
"might have had some faint doubts whether it was not rather ugly,","Great Expectations"
"crooked, narrow, and dirty.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Jaggers had duly sent me his address; it was, Little Britain, and","Great Expectations"
"he had written after it on his card, “just out of Smithfield, and close","Great Expectations"
"by the coach-office.” Nevertheless, a hackney-coachman, who seemed to","Great Expectations"
"have as many capes to his greasy great-coat as he was years old, packed","Great Expectations"
"me up in his coach and hemmed me in with a folding and jingling barrier","Great Expectations"
"of steps, as if he were going to take me fifty miles. His getting on","Great Expectations"
"his box, which I remember to have been decorated with an old","Great Expectations"
"weather-stained pea-green hammercloth moth-eaten into rags, was quite a","Great Expectations"
"work of time. It was a wonderful equipage, with six great coronets","Great Expectations"
"outside, and ragged things behind for I don’t know how many footmen to","Great Expectations"
"hold on by, and a harrow below them, to prevent amateur footmen from","Great Expectations"
"yielding to the temptation.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I had scarcely had time to enjoy the coach and to think how like a","Great Expectations"
"straw-yard it was, and yet how like a rag-shop, and to wonder why the","Great Expectations"
"horses’ nose-bags were kept inside, when I observed the coachman","Great Expectations"
"beginning to get down, as if we were going to stop presently. And stop","Great Expectations"
"we presently did, in a gloomy street, at certain offices with an open","Great Expectations"
"door, whereon was painted MR. JAGGERS.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“How much?” I asked the coachman.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The coachman answered, “A shilling—unless you wish to make it more.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I naturally said I had no wish to make it more.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Then it must be a shilling,” observed the coachman. “I don’t want to","Great Expectations"
"get into trouble. _I_ know _him_!” He darkly closed an eye at Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Jaggers’s name, and shook his head.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"When he had got his shilling, and had in course of time completed the","Great Expectations"
"ascent to his box, and had got away (which appeared to relieve his","Great Expectations"
"mind), I went into the front office with my little portmanteau in my","Great Expectations"
"hand and asked, Was Mr. Jaggers at home?","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“He is not,” returned the clerk. “He is in Court at present. Am I","Great Expectations"
"addressing Mr. Pip?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I signified that he was addressing Mr. Pip.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Mr. Jaggers left word, would you wait in his room. He couldn’t say how","Great Expectations"
"long he might be, having a case on. But it stands to reason, his time","Great Expectations"
"being valuable, that he won’t be longer than he can help.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"With those words, the clerk opened a door, and ushered me into an inner","Great Expectations"
"chamber at the back. Here, we found a gentleman with one eye, in a","Great Expectations"
"velveteen suit and knee-breeches, who wiped his nose with his sleeve on","Great Expectations"
"being interrupted in the perusal of the newspaper.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Go and wait outside, Mike,” said the clerk.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I began to say that I hoped I was not interrupting, when the clerk","Great Expectations"
"shoved this gentleman out with as little ceremony as I ever saw used,","Great Expectations"
"and tossing his fur cap out after him, left me alone.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Jaggers’s room was lighted by a skylight only, and was a most","Great Expectations"
"dismal place; the skylight, eccentrically pitched like a broken head,","Great Expectations"
"and the distorted adjoining houses looking as if they had twisted","Great Expectations"
"themselves to peep down at me through it. There were not so many papers","Great Expectations"
"about, as I should have expected to see; and there were some odd","Great Expectations"
"objects about, that I should not have expected to see,—such as an old","Great Expectations"
"rusty pistol, a sword in a scabbard, several strange-looking boxes and","Great Expectations"
"packages, and two dreadful casts on a shelf, of faces peculiarly","Great Expectations"
"swollen, and twitchy about the nose. Mr. Jaggers’s own high-backed","Great Expectations"
"chair was of deadly black horsehair, with rows of brass nails round it,","Great Expectations"
"like a coffin; and I fancied I could see how he leaned back in it, and","Great Expectations"
"bit his forefinger at the clients. The room was but small, and the","Great Expectations"
"clients seemed to have had a habit of backing up against the wall; the","Great Expectations"
"wall, especially opposite to Mr. Jaggers’s chair, being greasy with","Great Expectations"
"shoulders. I recalled, too, that the one-eyed gentleman had shuffled","Great Expectations"
"forth against the wall when I was the innocent cause of his being","Great Expectations"
"turned out.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I sat down in the cliental chair placed over against Mr. Jaggers’s","Great Expectations"
"chair, and became fascinated by the dismal atmosphere of the place. I","Great Expectations"
"called to mind that the clerk had the same air of knowing something to","Great Expectations"
"everybody else’s disadvantage, as his master had. I wondered how many","Great Expectations"
"other clerks there were upstairs, and whether they all claimed to have","Great Expectations"
"the same detrimental mastery of their fellow-creatures. I wondered what","Great Expectations"
"was the history of all the odd litter about the room, and how it came","Great Expectations"
"there. I wondered whether the two swollen faces were of Mr. Jaggers’s","Great Expectations"
"family, and, if he were so unfortunate as to have had a pair of such","Great Expectations"
"ill-looking relations, why he stuck them on that dusty perch for the","Great Expectations"
"blacks and flies to settle on, instead of giving them a place at home.","Great Expectations"
"Of course I had no experience of a London summer day, and my spirits","Great Expectations"
"may have been oppressed by the hot exhausted air, and by the dust and","Great Expectations"
"grit that lay thick on everything. But I sat wondering and waiting in","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Jaggers’s close room, until I really could not bear the two casts","Great Expectations"
"on the shelf above Mr. Jaggers’s chair, and got up and went out.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"When I told the clerk that I would take a turn in the air while I","Great Expectations"
"waited, he advised me to go round the corner and I should come into","Great Expectations"
"Smithfield. So I came into Smithfield; and the shameful place, being","Great Expectations"
"all asmear with filth and fat and blood and foam, seemed to stick to","Great Expectations"
"me. So, I rubbed it off with all possible speed by turning into a","Great Expectations"
"street where I saw the great black dome of Saint Paul’s bulging at me","Great Expectations"
"from behind a grim stone building which a bystander said was Newgate","Great Expectations"
"Prison. Following the wall of the jail, I found the roadway covered","Great Expectations"
"with straw to deaden the noise of passing vehicles; and from this, and","Great Expectations"
"from the quantity of people standing about smelling strongly of spirits","Great Expectations"
"and beer, I inferred that the trials were on.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"While I looked about me here, an exceedingly dirty and partially drunk","Great Expectations"
"minister of justice asked me if I would like to step in and hear a","Great Expectations"
"trial or so: informing me that he could give me a front place for half","Great Expectations"
"a crown, whence I should command a full view of the Lord Chief Justice","Great Expectations"
"in his wig and robes,—mentioning that awful personage like waxwork, and","Great Expectations"
"presently offering him at the reduced price of eighteen-pence. As I","Great Expectations"
"declined the proposal on the plea of an appointment, he was so good as","Great Expectations"
"to take me into a yard and show me where the gallows was kept, and also","Great Expectations"
"where people were publicly whipped, and then he showed me the Debtors’","Great Expectations"
"Door, out of which culprits came to be hanged; heightening the interest","Great Expectations"
"of that dreadful portal by giving me to understand that “four on ’em”","Great Expectations"
"would come out at that door the day after to-morrow at eight in the","Great Expectations"
"morning, to be killed in a row. This was horrible, and gave me a","Great Expectations"
"sickening idea of London; the more so as the Lord Chief Justice’s","Great Expectations"
"proprietor wore (from his hat down to his boots and up again to his","Great Expectations"
"pocket-handkerchief inclusive) mildewed clothes which had evidently not","Great Expectations"
"belonged to him originally, and which I took it into my head he had","Great Expectations"
"bought cheap of the executioner. Under these circumstances I thought","Great Expectations"
"myself well rid of him for a shilling.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I dropped into the office to ask if Mr. Jaggers had come in yet, and I","Great Expectations"
"found he had not, and I strolled out again. This time, I made the tour","Great Expectations"
"of Little Britain, and turned into Bartholomew Close; and now I became","Great Expectations"
"aware that other people were waiting about for Mr. Jaggers, as well as","Great Expectations"
"I. There were two men of secret appearance lounging in Bartholomew","Great Expectations"
"Close, and thoughtfully fitting their feet into the cracks of the","Great Expectations"
"pavement as they talked together, one of whom said to the other when","Great Expectations"
"they first passed me, that “Jaggers would do it if it was to be done.”","Great Expectations"
"There was a knot of three men and two women standing at a corner, and","Great Expectations"
"one of the women was crying on her dirty shawl, and the other comforted","Great Expectations"
"her by saying, as she pulled her own shawl over her shoulders, “Jaggers","Great Expectations"
"is for him, ’Melia, and what more _could_ you have?” There was a","Great Expectations"
"red-eyed little Jew who came into the Close while I was loitering","Great Expectations"
"there, in company with a second little Jew whom he sent upon an errand;","Great Expectations"
"and while the messenger was gone, I remarked this Jew, who was of a","Great Expectations"
"highly excitable temperament, performing a jig of anxiety under a","Great Expectations"
"lamp-post and accompanying himself, in a kind of frenzy, with the","Great Expectations"
"words, “O Jaggerth, Jaggerth, Jaggerth! all otherth ith Cag-Maggerth,","Great Expectations"
"give me Jaggerth!” These testimonies to the popularity of my guardian","Great Expectations"
"made a deep impression on me, and I admired and wondered more than","Great Expectations"
"ever.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"At length, as I was looking out at the iron gate of Bartholomew Close","Great Expectations"
"into Little Britain, I saw Mr. Jaggers coming across the road towards","Great Expectations"
"me. All the others who were waiting saw him at the same time, and there","Great Expectations"
"was quite a rush at him. Mr. Jaggers, putting a hand on my shoulder and","Great Expectations"
"walking me on at his side without saying anything to me, addressed","Great Expectations"
"himself to his followers.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"First, he took the two secret men.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Now, I have nothing to say to _you_,” said Mr. Jaggers, throwing his","Great Expectations"
"finger at them. “I want to know no more than I know. As to the result,","Great Expectations"
"it’s a toss-up. I told you from the first it was a toss-up. Have you","Great Expectations"
"paid Wemmick?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“We made the money up this morning, sir,” said one of the men,","Great Expectations"
"submissively, while the other perused Mr. Jaggers’s face.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I don’t ask you when you made it up, or where, or whether you made it","Great Expectations"
"up at all. Has Wemmick got it?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, sir,” said both the men together.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Very well; then you may go. Now, I won’t have it!” said Mr Jaggers,","Great Expectations"
"waving his hand at them to put them behind him. “If you say a word to","Great Expectations"
"me, I’ll throw up the case.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“We thought, Mr. Jaggers—” one of the men began, pulling off his hat.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“That’s what I told you not to do,” said Mr. Jaggers. “_You_ thought! I","Great Expectations"
"think for you; that’s enough for you. If I want you, I know where to","Great Expectations"
"find you; I don’t want you to find me. Now I won’t have it. I won’t","Great Expectations"
"hear a word.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The two men looked at one another as Mr. Jaggers waved them behind","Great Expectations"
"again, and humbly fell back and were heard no more.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And now _you_!” said Mr. Jaggers, suddenly stopping, and turning on","Great Expectations"
"the two women with the shawls, from whom the three men had meekly","Great Expectations"
"separated,—“Oh! Amelia, is it?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, Mr. Jaggers.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And do you remember,” retorted Mr. Jaggers, “that but for me you","Great Expectations"
"wouldn’t be here and couldn’t be here?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“O yes, sir!” exclaimed both women together. “Lord bless you, sir, well","Great Expectations"
"we knows that!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Then why,” said Mr. Jaggers, “do you come here?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“My Bill, sir!” the crying woman pleaded.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Now, I tell you what!” said Mr. Jaggers. “Once for all. If you don’t","Great Expectations"
"know that your Bill’s in good hands, I know it. And if you come here","Great Expectations"
"bothering about your Bill, I’ll make an example of both your Bill and","Great Expectations"
"you, and let him slip through my fingers. Have you paid Wemmick?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“O yes, sir! Every farden.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Very well. Then you have done all you have got to do. Say another","Great Expectations"
"word—one single word—and Wemmick shall give you your money back.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"This terrible threat caused the two women to fall off immediately. No","Great Expectations"
"one remained now but the excitable Jew, who had already raised the","Great Expectations"
"skirts of Mr. Jaggers’s coat to his lips several times.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I don’t know this man!” said Mr. Jaggers, in the same devastating","Great Expectations"
"strain: “What does this fellow want?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Ma thear Mithter Jaggerth. Hown brother to Habraham Latharuth?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Who’s he?” said Mr. Jaggers. “Let go of my coat.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The suitor, kissing the hem of the garment again before relinquishing","Great Expectations"
"it, replied, “Habraham Latharuth, on thuthpithion of plate.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You’re too late,” said Mr. Jaggers. “I am over the way.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Holy father, Mithter Jaggerth!” cried my excitable acquaintance,","Great Expectations"
"turning white, “don’t thay you’re again Habraham Latharuth!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I am,” said Mr. Jaggers, “and there’s an end of it. Get out of the","Great Expectations"
"way.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Mithter Jaggerth! Half a moment! My hown cuthen’th gone to Mithter","Great Expectations"
"Wemmick at thith prethent minute, to hoffer him hany termth. Mithter","Great Expectations"
"Jaggerth! Half a quarter of a moment! If you’d have the condethenthun","Great Expectations"
"to be bought off from the t’other thide—at hany thuperior prithe!—money","Great Expectations"
"no object!—Mithter Jaggerth—Mithter—!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"My guardian threw his supplicant off with supreme indifference, and","Great Expectations"
"left him dancing on the pavement as if it were red hot. Without further","Great Expectations"
"interruption, we reached the front office, where we found the clerk and","Great Expectations"
"the man in velveteen with the fur cap.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Here’s Mike,” said the clerk, getting down from his stool, and","Great Expectations"
"approaching Mr. Jaggers confidentially.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Oh!” said Mr. Jaggers, turning to the man, who was pulling a lock of","Great Expectations"
"hair in the middle of his forehead, like the Bull in Cock Robin pulling","Great Expectations"
"at the bell-rope; “your man comes on this afternoon. Well?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well, Mas’r Jaggers,” returned Mike, in the voice of a sufferer from a","Great Expectations"
"constitutional cold; “arter a deal o’ trouble, I’ve found one, sir, as","Great Expectations"
"might do.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What is he prepared to swear?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well, Mas’r Jaggers,” said Mike, wiping his nose on his fur cap this","Great Expectations"
"time; “in a general way, anythink.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Jaggers suddenly became most irate. “Now, I warned you before,”","Great Expectations"
"said he, throwing his forefinger at the terrified client, “that if you","Great Expectations"
"ever presumed to talk in that way here, I’d make an example of you. You","Great Expectations"
"infernal scoundrel, how dare you tell ME that?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The client looked scared, but bewildered too, as if he were unconscious","Great Expectations"
"what he had done.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Spooney!” said the clerk, in a low voice, giving him a stir with his","Great Expectations"
"elbow. “Soft Head! Need you say it face to face?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Now, I ask you, you blundering booby,” said my guardian, very sternly,","Great Expectations"
"“once more and for the last time, what the man you have brought here is","Great Expectations"
"prepared to swear?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mike looked hard at my guardian, as if he were trying to learn a lesson","Great Expectations"
"from his face, and slowly replied, “Ayther to character, or to having","Great Expectations"
"been in his company and never left him all the night in question.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Now, be careful. In what station of life is this man?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mike looked at his cap, and looked at the floor, and looked at the","Great Expectations"
"ceiling, and looked at the clerk, and even looked at me, before","Great Expectations"
"beginning to reply in a nervous manner, “We’ve dressed him up like—”","Great Expectations"
"when my guardian blustered out,—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What? You WILL, will you?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"(“Spooney!” added the clerk again, with another stir.)","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"After some helpless casting about, Mike brightened and began again:—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“He is dressed like a ’spectable pieman. A sort of a pastry-cook.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Is he here?” asked my guardian.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I left him,” said Mike, “a setting on some doorsteps round the","Great Expectations"
"corner.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Take him past that window, and let me see him.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The window indicated was the office window. We all three went to it,","Great Expectations"
"behind the wire blind, and presently saw the client go by in an","Great Expectations"
"accidental manner, with a murderous-looking tall individual, in a short","Great Expectations"
"suit of white linen and a paper cap. This guileless confectioner was","Great Expectations"
"not by any means sober, and had a black eye in the green stage of","Great Expectations"
"recovery, which was painted over.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Tell him to take his witness away directly,” said my guardian to the","Great Expectations"
"clerk, in extreme disgust, “and ask him what he means by bringing such","Great Expectations"
"a fellow as that.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"My guardian then took me into his own room, and while he lunched,","Great Expectations"
"standing, from a sandwich-box and a pocket-flask of sherry (he seemed","Great Expectations"
"to bully his very sandwich as he ate it), informed me what arrangements","Great Expectations"
"he had made for me. I was to go to “Barnard’s Inn,” to young Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Pocket’s rooms, where a bed had been sent in for my accommodation; I","Great Expectations"
"was to remain with young Mr. Pocket until Monday; on Monday I was to go","Great Expectations"
"with him to his father’s house on a visit, that I might try how I liked","Great Expectations"
"it. Also, I was told what my allowance was to be,—it was a very liberal","Great Expectations"
"one,—and had handed to me from one of my guardian’s drawers, the cards","Great Expectations"
"of certain tradesmen with whom I was to deal for all kinds of clothes,","Great Expectations"
"and such other things as I could in reason want. “You will find your","Great Expectations"
"credit good, Mr. Pip,” said my guardian, whose flask of sherry smelt","Great Expectations"
"like a whole caskful, as he hastily refreshed himself, “but I shall by","Great Expectations"
"this means be able to check your bills, and to pull you up if I find","Great Expectations"
"you outrunning the constable. Of course you’ll go wrong somehow, but","Great Expectations"
"that’s no fault of mine.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"After I had pondered a little over this encouraging sentiment, I asked","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Jaggers if I could send for a coach? He said it was not worth","Great Expectations"
"while, I was so near my destination; Wemmick should walk round with me,","Great Expectations"
"if I pleased.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I then found that Wemmick was the clerk in the next room. Another clerk","Great Expectations"
"was rung down from upstairs to take his place while he was out, and I","Great Expectations"
"accompanied him into the street, after shaking hands with my guardian.","Great Expectations"
"We found a new set of people lingering outside, but Wemmick made a way","Great Expectations"
"among them by saying coolly yet decisively, “I tell you it’s no use; he","Great Expectations"
"won’t have a word to say to one of you;” and we soon got clear of them,","Great Expectations"
"and went on side by side.","Great Expectations"

"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Casting my eyes on Mr. Wemmick as we went along, to see what he was","Great Expectations"
"like in the light of day, I found him to be a dry man, rather short in","Great Expectations"
"stature, with a square wooden face, whose expression seemed to have","Great Expectations"
"been imperfectly chipped out with a dull-edged chisel. There were some","Great Expectations"
"marks in it that might have been dimples, if the material had been","Great Expectations"
"softer and the instrument finer, but which, as it was, were only dints.","Great Expectations"
"The chisel had made three or four of these attempts at embellishment","Great Expectations"
"over his nose, but had given them up without an effort to smooth them","Great Expectations"
"off. I judged him to be a bachelor from the frayed condition of his","Great Expectations"
"linen, and he appeared to have sustained a good many bereavements; for","Great Expectations"
"he wore at least four mourning rings, besides a brooch representing a","Great Expectations"
"lady and a weeping willow at a tomb with an urn on it. I noticed, too,","Great Expectations"
"that several rings and seals hung at his watch-chain, as if he were","Great Expectations"
"quite laden with remembrances of departed friends. He had glittering","Great Expectations"
"eyes,—small, keen, and black,—and thin wide mottled lips. He had had","Great Expectations"
"them, to the best of my belief, from forty to fifty years.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“So you were never in London before?” said Mr. Wemmick to me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No,” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“_I_ was new here once,” said Mr. Wemmick. “Rum to think of now!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You are well acquainted with it now?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Why, yes,” said Mr. Wemmick. “I know the moves of it.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Is it a very wicked place?” I asked, more for the sake of saying","Great Expectations"
"something than for information.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You may get cheated, robbed, and murdered in London. But there are","Great Expectations"
"plenty of people anywhere, who’ll do that for you.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“If there is bad blood between you and them,” said I, to soften it off","Great Expectations"
"a little.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“O! I don’t know about bad blood,” returned Mr. Wemmick; “there’s not","Great Expectations"
"much bad blood about. They’ll do it, if there’s anything to be got by","Great Expectations"
"it.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“That makes it worse.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You think so?” returned Mr. Wemmick. “Much about the same, I should","Great Expectations"
"say.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He wore his hat on the back of his head, and looked straight before","Great Expectations"
"him: walking in a self-contained way as if there were nothing in the","Great Expectations"
"streets to claim his attention. His mouth was such a post-office of a","Great Expectations"
"mouth that he had a mechanical appearance of smiling. We had got to the","Great Expectations"
"top of Holborn Hill before I knew that it was merely a mechanical","Great Expectations"
"appearance, and that he was not smiling at all.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Do you know where Mr. Matthew Pocket lives?” I asked Mr. Wemmick.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes,” said he, nodding in the direction. “At Hammersmith, west of","Great Expectations"
"London.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Is that far?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well! Say five miles.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Do you know him?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Why, you’re a regular cross-examiner!” said Mr. Wemmick, looking at me","Great Expectations"
"with an approving air. “Yes, I know him. _I_ know him!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"There was an air of toleration or depreciation about his utterance of","Great Expectations"
"these words that rather depressed me; and I was still looking sideways","Great Expectations"
"at his block of a face in search of any encouraging note to the text,","Great Expectations"
"when he said here we were at Barnard’s Inn. My depression was not","Great Expectations"
"alleviated by the announcement, for, I had supposed that establishment","Great Expectations"
"to be an hotel kept by Mr. Barnard, to which the Blue Boar in our town","Great Expectations"
"was a mere public-house. Whereas I now found Barnard to be a","Great Expectations"
"disembodied spirit, or a fiction, and his inn the dingiest collection","Great Expectations"
"of shabby buildings ever squeezed together in a rank corner as a club","Great Expectations"
"for Tom-cats.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We entered this haven through a wicket-gate, and were disgorged by an","Great Expectations"
"introductory passage into a melancholy little square that looked to me","Great Expectations"
"like a flat burying-ground. I thought it had the most dismal trees in","Great Expectations"
"it, and the most dismal sparrows, and the most dismal cats, and the","Great Expectations"
"most dismal houses (in number half a dozen or so), that I had ever","Great Expectations"
"seen. I thought the windows of the sets of chambers into which those","Great Expectations"
"houses were divided were in every stage of dilapidated blind and","Great Expectations"
"curtain, crippled flower-pot, cracked glass, dusty decay, and miserable","Great Expectations"
"makeshift; while To Let, To Let, To Let, glared at me from empty rooms,","Great Expectations"
"as if no new wretches ever came there, and the vengeance of the soul of","Great Expectations"
"Barnard were being slowly appeased by the gradual suicide of the","Great Expectations"
"present occupants and their unholy interment under the gravel. A frowzy","Great Expectations"
"mourning of soot and smoke attired this forlorn creation of Barnard,","Great Expectations"
"and it had strewn ashes on its head, and was undergoing penance and","Great Expectations"
"humiliation as a mere dust-hole. Thus far my sense of sight; while dry","Great Expectations"
"rot and wet rot and all the silent rots that rot in neglected roof and","Great Expectations"
"cellar,—rot of rat and mouse and bug and coaching-stables near at hand","Great Expectations"
"besides—addressed themselves faintly to my sense of smell, and moaned,","Great Expectations"
"“Try Barnard’s Mixture.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"So imperfect was this realisation of the first of my great","Great Expectations"
"expectations, that I looked in dismay at Mr. Wemmick. “Ah!” said he,","Great Expectations"
"mistaking me; “the retirement reminds you of the country. So it does","Great Expectations"
"me.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He led me into a corner and conducted me up a flight of stairs,—which","Great Expectations"
"appeared to me to be slowly collapsing into sawdust, so that one of","Great Expectations"
"those days the upper lodgers would look out at their doors and find","Great Expectations"
"themselves without the means of coming down,—to a set of chambers on","Great Expectations"
"the top floor. MR. POCKET, JUN., was painted on the door, and there was","Great Expectations"
"a label on the letter-box, “Return shortly.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“He hardly thought you’d come so soon,” Mr. Wemmick explained. “You","Great Expectations"
"don’t want me any more?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No, thank you,” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“As I keep the cash,” Mr. Wemmick observed, “we shall most likely meet","Great Expectations"
"pretty often. Good day.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Good day.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I put out my hand, and Mr. Wemmick at first looked at it as if he","Great Expectations"
"thought I wanted something. Then he looked at me, and said, correcting","Great Expectations"
"himself,—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“To be sure! Yes. You’re in the habit of shaking hands?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I was rather confused, thinking it must be out of the London fashion,","Great Expectations"
"but said yes.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I have got so out of it!” said Mr. Wemmick,—“except at last. Very","Great Expectations"
"glad, I’m sure, to make your acquaintance. Good day!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"When we had shaken hands and he was gone, I opened the staircase window","Great Expectations"
"and had nearly beheaded myself, for, the lines had rotted away, and it","Great Expectations"
"came down like the guillotine. Happily it was so quick that I had not","Great Expectations"
"put my head out. After this escape, I was content to take a foggy view","Great Expectations"
"of the Inn through the window’s encrusting dirt, and to stand dolefully","Great Expectations"
"looking out, saying to myself that London was decidedly overrated.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Pocket, Junior’s, idea of Shortly was not mine, for I had nearly","Great Expectations"
"maddened myself with looking out for half an hour, and had written my","Great Expectations"
"name with my finger several times in the dirt of every pane in the","Great Expectations"
"window, before I heard footsteps on the stairs. Gradually there arose","Great Expectations"
"before me the hat, head, neckcloth, waistcoat, trousers, boots, of a","Great Expectations"
"member of society of about my own standing. He had a paper-bag under","Great Expectations"
"each arm and a pottle of strawberries in one hand, and was out of","Great Expectations"
"breath.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Mr. Pip?” said he.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Mr. Pocket?” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Dear me!” he exclaimed. “I am extremely sorry; but I knew there was a","Great Expectations"
"coach from your part of the country at midday, and I thought you would","Great Expectations"
"come by that one. The fact is, I have been out on your account,—not","Great Expectations"
"that that is any excuse,—for I thought, coming from the country, you","Great Expectations"
"might like a little fruit after dinner, and I went to Covent Garden","Great Expectations"
"Market to get it good.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"For a reason that I had, I felt as if my eyes would start out of my","Great Expectations"
"head. I acknowledged his attention incoherently, and began to think","Great Expectations"
"this was a dream.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Dear me!” said Mr. Pocket, Junior. “This door sticks so!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As he was fast making jam of his fruit by wrestling with the door while","Great Expectations"
"the paper-bags were under his arms, I begged him to allow me to hold","Great Expectations"
"them. He relinquished them with an agreeable smile, and combated with","Great Expectations"
"the door as if it were a wild beast. It yielded so suddenly at last,","Great Expectations"
"that he staggered back upon me, and I staggered back upon the opposite","Great Expectations"
"door, and we both laughed. But still I felt as if my eyes must start","Great Expectations"
"out of my head, and as if this must be a dream.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Pray come in,” said Mr. Pocket, Junior. “Allow me to lead the way. I","Great Expectations"
"am rather bare here, but I hope you’ll be able to make out tolerably","Great Expectations"
"well till Monday. My father thought you would get on more agreeably","Great Expectations"
"through to-morrow with me than with him, and might like to take a walk","Great Expectations"
"about London. I am sure I shall be very happy to show London to you. As","Great Expectations"
"to our table, you won’t find that bad, I hope, for it will be supplied","Great Expectations"
"from our coffee-house here, and (it is only right I should add) at your","Great Expectations"
"expense, such being Mr. Jaggers’s directions. As to our lodging, it’s","Great Expectations"
"not by any means splendid, because I have my own bread to earn, and my","Great Expectations"
"father hasn’t anything to give me, and I shouldn’t be willing to take","Great Expectations"
"it, if he had. This is our sitting-room,—just such chairs and tables","Great Expectations"
"and carpet and so forth, you see, as they could spare from home. You","Great Expectations"
"mustn’t give me credit for the tablecloth and spoons and castors,","Great Expectations"
"because they come for you from the coffee-house. This is my little","Great Expectations"
"bedroom; rather musty, but Barnard’s _is_ musty. This is your bedroom;","Great Expectations"
"the furniture’s hired for the occasion, but I trust it will answer the","Great Expectations"
"purpose; if you should want anything, I’ll go and fetch it. The","Great Expectations"
"chambers are retired, and we shall be alone together, but we shan’t","Great Expectations"
"fight, I dare say. But dear me, I beg your pardon, you’re holding the","Great Expectations"
"fruit all this time. Pray let me take these bags from you. I am quite","Great Expectations"
"ashamed.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As I stood opposite to Mr. Pocket, Junior, delivering him the bags,","Great Expectations"
"One, Two, I saw the starting appearance come into his own eyes that I","Great Expectations"
"knew to be in mine, and he said, falling back,—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Lord bless me, you’re the prowling boy!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And you,” said I, “are the pale young gentleman!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Chapter XXII.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The pale young gentleman and I stood contemplating one another in","Great Expectations"
"Barnard’s Inn, until we both burst out laughing. “The idea of its being","Great Expectations"
"you!” said he. “The idea of its being _you_!” said I. And then we","Great Expectations"
"contemplated one another afresh, and laughed again. “Well!” said the","Great Expectations"
"pale young gentleman, reaching out his hand good-humouredly, “it’s all","Great Expectations"
"over now, I hope, and it will be magnanimous in you if you’ll forgive","Great Expectations"
"me for having knocked you about so.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I derived from this speech that Mr. Herbert Pocket (for Herbert was the","Great Expectations"
"pale young gentleman’s name) still rather confounded his intention with","Great Expectations"
"his execution. But I made a modest reply, and we shook hands warmly.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You hadn’t come into your good fortune at that time?” said Herbert","Great Expectations"
"Pocket.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No,” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No,” he acquiesced: “I heard it had happened very lately. _I_ was","Great Expectations"
"rather on the lookout for good fortune then.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Indeed?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes. Miss Havisham had sent for me, to see if she could take a fancy","Great Expectations"
"to me. But she couldn’t,—at all events, she didn’t.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I thought it polite to remark that I was surprised to hear that.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Bad taste,” said Herbert, laughing, “but a fact. Yes, she had sent for","Great Expectations"
"me on a trial visit, and if I had come out of it successfully, I","Great Expectations"
"suppose I should have been provided for; perhaps I should have been","Great Expectations"
"what-you-may-called it to Estella.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What’s that?” I asked, with sudden gravity.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He was arranging his fruit in plates while we talked, which divided his","Great Expectations"
"attention, and was the cause of his having made this lapse of a word.","Great Expectations"
"“Affianced,” he explained, still busy with the fruit. “Betrothed.","Great Expectations"
"Engaged. What’s-his-named. Any word of that sort.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“How did you bear your disappointment?” I asked.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Pooh!” said he, “I didn’t care much for it. _She’s_ a Tartar.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Miss Havisham?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I don’t say no to that, but I meant Estella. That girl’s hard and","Great Expectations"
"haughty and capricious to the last degree, and has been brought up by","Great Expectations"
"Miss Havisham to wreak revenge on all the male sex.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What relation is she to Miss Havisham?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“None,” said he. “Only adopted.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Why should she wreak revenge on all the male sex? What revenge?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Lord, Mr. Pip!” said he. “Don’t you know?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No,” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Dear me! It’s quite a story, and shall be saved till dinner-time. And","Great Expectations"
"now let me take the liberty of asking you a question. How did you come","Great Expectations"
"there, that day?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I told him, and he was attentive until I had finished, and then burst","Great Expectations"
"out laughing again, and asked me if I was sore afterwards? I didn’t ask","Great Expectations"
"him if _he_ was, for my conviction on that point was perfectly","Great Expectations"
"established.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Mr. Jaggers is your guardian, I understand?” he went on.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You know he is Miss Havisham’s man of business and solicitor, and has","Great Expectations"
"her confidence when nobody else has?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"This was bringing me (I felt) towards dangerous ground. I answered with","Great Expectations"
"a constraint I made no attempt to disguise, that I had seen Mr. Jaggers","Great Expectations"
"in Miss Havisham’s house on the very day of our combat, but never at","Great Expectations"
"any other time, and that I believed he had no recollection of having","Great Expectations"
"ever seen me there.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“He was so obliging as to suggest my father for your tutor, and he","Great Expectations"
"called on my father to propose it. Of course he knew about my father","Great Expectations"
"from his connection with Miss Havisham. My father is Miss Havisham’s","Great Expectations"
"cousin; not that that implies familiar intercourse between them, for he","Great Expectations"
"is a bad courtier and will not propitiate her.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Herbert Pocket had a frank and easy way with him that was very taking.","Great Expectations"
"I had never seen any one then, and I have never seen any one since, who","Great Expectations"
"more strongly expressed to me, in every look and tone, a natural","Great Expectations"
"incapacity to do anything secret and mean. There was something","Great Expectations"
"wonderfully hopeful about his general air, and something that at the","Great Expectations"
"same time whispered to me he would never be very successful or rich. I","Great Expectations"
"don’t know how this was. I became imbued with the notion on that first","Great Expectations"
"occasion before we sat down to dinner, but I cannot define by what","Great Expectations"
"means.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He was still a pale young gentleman, and had a certain conquered","Great Expectations"
"languor about him in the midst of his spirits and briskness, that did","Great Expectations"
"not seem indicative of natural strength. He had not a handsome face,","Great Expectations"
"but it was better than handsome: being extremely amiable and cheerful.","Great Expectations"
"His figure was a little ungainly, as in the days when my knuckles had","Great Expectations"
"taken such liberties with it, but it looked as if it would always be","Great Expectations"
"light and young. Whether Mr. Trabb’s local work would have sat more","Great Expectations"
"gracefully on him than on me, may be a question; but I am conscious","Great Expectations"
"that he carried off his rather old clothes much better than I carried","Great Expectations"
"off my new suit.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As he was so communicative, I felt that reserve on my part would be a","Great Expectations"
"bad return unsuited to our years. I therefore told him my small story,","Great Expectations"
"and laid stress on my being forbidden to inquire who my benefactor was.","Great Expectations"
"I further mentioned that as I had been brought up a blacksmith in a","Great Expectations"
"country place, and knew very little of the ways of politeness, I would","Great Expectations"
"take it as a great kindness in him if he would give me a hint whenever","Great Expectations"
"he saw me at a loss or going wrong.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“With pleasure,” said he, “though I venture to prophesy that you’ll","Great Expectations"
"want very few hints. I dare say we shall be often together, and I","Great Expectations"
"should like to banish any needless restraint between us. Will you do me","Great Expectations"
"the favour to begin at once to call me by my Christian name, Herbert?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I thanked him and said I would. I informed him in exchange that my","Great Expectations"
"Christian name was Philip.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I don’t take to Philip,” said he, smiling, “for it sounds like a moral","Great Expectations"
"boy out of the spelling-book, who was so lazy that he fell into a pond,","Great Expectations"
"or so fat that he couldn’t see out of his eyes, or so avaricious that","Great Expectations"
"he locked up his cake till the mice ate it, or so determined to go a","Great Expectations"
"bird’s-nesting that he got himself eaten by bears who lived handy in","Great Expectations"
"the neighbourhood. I tell you what I should like. We are so harmonious,","Great Expectations"
"and you have been a blacksmith,—would you mind it?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I shouldn’t mind anything that you propose,” I answered, “but I don’t","Great Expectations"
"understand you.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Would you mind Handel for a familiar name? There’s a charming piece of","Great Expectations"
"music by Handel, called the Harmonious Blacksmith.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I should like it very much.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Then, my dear Handel,” said he, turning round as the door opened,","Great Expectations"
"“here is the dinner, and I must beg of you to take the top of the","Great Expectations"
"table, because the dinner is of your providing.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"This I would not hear of, so he took the top, and I faced him. It was a","Great Expectations"
"nice little dinner,—seemed to me then a very Lord Mayor’s Feast,—and it","Great Expectations"
"acquired additional relish from being eaten under those independent","Great Expectations"
"circumstances, with no old people by, and with London all around us.","Great Expectations"
"This again was heightened by a certain gypsy character that set the","Great Expectations"
"banquet off; for while the table was, as Mr. Pumblechook might have","Great Expectations"
"said, the lap of luxury,—being entirely furnished forth from the","Great Expectations"
"coffee-house,—the circumjacent region of sitting-room was of a","Great Expectations"
"comparatively pastureless and shifty character; imposing on the waiter","Great Expectations"
"the wandering habits of putting the covers on the floor (where he fell","Great Expectations"
"over them), the melted butter in the arm-chair, the bread on the","Great Expectations"
"bookshelves, the cheese in the coal-scuttle, and the boiled fowl into","Great Expectations"
"my bed in the next room,—where I found much of its parsley and butter","Great Expectations"
"in a state of congelation when I retired for the night. All this made","Great Expectations"
"the feast delightful, and when the waiter was not there to watch me, my","Great Expectations"
"pleasure was without alloy.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We had made some progress in the dinner, when I reminded Herbert of his","Great Expectations"
"promise to tell me about Miss Havisham.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“True,” he replied. “I’ll redeem it at once. Let me introduce the","Great Expectations"
"topic, Handel, by mentioning that in London it is not the custom to put","Great Expectations"
"the knife in the mouth,—for fear of accidents,—and that while the fork","Great Expectations"
"is reserved for that use, it is not put further in than necessary. It","Great Expectations"
"is scarcely worth mentioning, only it’s as well to do as other people","Great Expectations"
"do. Also, the spoon is not generally used over-hand, but under. This","Great Expectations"
"has two advantages. You get at your mouth better (which after all is","Great Expectations"
"the object), and you save a good deal of the attitude of opening","Great Expectations"
"oysters, on the part of the right elbow.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He offered these friendly suggestions in such a lively way, that we","Great Expectations"
"both laughed and I scarcely blushed.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Now,” he pursued, “concerning Miss Havisham. Miss Havisham, you must","Great Expectations"
"know, was a spoilt child. Her mother died when she was a baby, and her","Great Expectations"
"father denied her nothing. Her father was a country gentleman down in","Great Expectations"
"your part of the world, and was a brewer. I don’t know why it should be","Great Expectations"
"a crack thing to be a brewer; but it is indisputable that while you","Great Expectations"
"cannot possibly be genteel and bake, you may be as genteel as never was","Great Expectations"
"and brew. You see it every day.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yet a gentleman may not keep a public-house; may he?” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Not on any account,” returned Herbert; “but a public-house may keep a","Great Expectations"
"gentleman. Well! Mr. Havisham was very rich and very proud. So was his","Great Expectations"
"daughter.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Miss Havisham was an only child?” I hazarded.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Stop a moment, I am coming to that. No, she was not an only child; she","Great Expectations"
"had a half-brother. Her father privately married again—his cook, I","Great Expectations"
"rather think.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I thought he was proud,” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“My good Handel, so he was. He married his second wife privately,","Great Expectations"
"because he was proud, and in course of time _she_ died. When she was","Great Expectations"
"dead, I apprehend he first told his daughter what he had done, and then","Great Expectations"
"the son became a part of the family, residing in the house you are","Great Expectations"
"acquainted with. As the son grew a young man, he turned out riotous,","Great Expectations"
"extravagant, undutiful,—altogether bad. At last his father disinherited","Great Expectations"
"him; but he softened when he was dying, and left him well off, though","Great Expectations"
"not nearly so well off as Miss Havisham.—Take another glass of wine,","Great Expectations"
"and excuse my mentioning that society as a body does not expect one to","Great Expectations"
"be so strictly conscientious in emptying one’s glass, as to turn it","Great Expectations"
"bottom upwards with the rim on one’s nose.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I had been doing this, in an excess of attention to his recital. I","Great Expectations"
"thanked him, and apologised. He said, “Not at all,” and resumed.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Miss Havisham was now an heiress, and you may suppose was looked after","Great Expectations"
"as a great match. Her half-brother had now ample means again, but what","Great Expectations"
"with debts and what with new madness wasted them most fearfully again.","Great Expectations"
"There were stronger differences between him and her than there had been","Great Expectations"
"between him and his father, and it is suspected that he cherished a","Great Expectations"
"deep and mortal grudge against her as having influenced the father’s","Great Expectations"
"anger. Now, I come to the cruel part of the story,—merely breaking off,","Great Expectations"
"my dear Handel, to remark that a dinner-napkin will not go into a","Great Expectations"
"tumbler.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Why I was trying to pack mine into my tumbler, I am wholly unable to","Great Expectations"
"say. I only know that I found myself, with a perseverance worthy of a","Great Expectations"
"much better cause, making the most strenuous exertions to compress it","Great Expectations"
"within those limits. Again I thanked him and apologised, and again he","Great Expectations"
"said in the cheerfullest manner, “Not at all, I am sure!” and resumed.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“There appeared upon the scene—say at the races, or the public balls,","Great Expectations"
"or anywhere else you like—a certain man, who made love to Miss","Great Expectations"
"Havisham. I never saw him (for this happened five-and-twenty years ago,","Great Expectations"
"before you and I were, Handel), but I have heard my father mention that","Great Expectations"
"he was a showy man, and the kind of man for the purpose. But that he","Great Expectations"
"was not to be, without ignorance or prejudice, mistaken for a","Great Expectations"
"gentleman, my father most strongly asseverates; because it is a","Great Expectations"
"principle of his that no man who was not a true gentleman at heart ever","Great Expectations"
"was, since the world began, a true gentleman in manner. He says, no","Great Expectations"
"varnish can hide the grain of the wood; and that the more varnish you","Great Expectations"
"put on, the more the grain will express itself. Well! This man pursued","Great Expectations"
"Miss Havisham closely, and professed to be devoted to her. I believe","Great Expectations"
"she had not shown much susceptibility up to that time; but all the","Great Expectations"
"susceptibility she possessed certainly came out then, and she","Great Expectations"
"passionately loved him. There is no doubt that she perfectly idolized","Great Expectations"
"him. He practised on her affection in that systematic way, that he got","Great Expectations"
"great sums of money from her, and he induced her to buy her brother out","Great Expectations"
"of a share in the brewery (which had been weakly left him by his","Great Expectations"
"father) at an immense price, on the plea that when he was her husband","Great Expectations"
"he must hold and manage it all. Your guardian was not at that time in","Great Expectations"
"Miss Havisham’s counsels, and she was too haughty and too much in love","Great Expectations"
"to be advised by any one. Her relations were poor and scheming, with","Great Expectations"
"the exception of my father; he was poor enough, but not time-serving or","Great Expectations"
"jealous. The only independent one among them, he warned her that she","Great Expectations"
"was doing too much for this man, and was placing herself too","Great Expectations"
"unreservedly in his power. She took the first opportunity of angrily","Great Expectations"
"ordering my father out of the house, in his presence, and my father has","Great Expectations"
"never seen her since.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I thought of her having said, “Matthew will come and see me at last","Great Expectations"
"when I am laid dead upon that table;” and I asked Herbert whether his","Great Expectations"
"father was so inveterate against her?","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It’s not that,” said he, “but she charged him, in the presence of her","Great Expectations"
"intended husband, with being disappointed in the hope of fawning upon","Great Expectations"
"her for his own advancement, and, if he were to go to her now, it would","Great Expectations"
"look true—even to him—and even to her. To return to the man and make an","Great Expectations"
"end of him. The marriage day was fixed, the wedding dresses were","Great Expectations"
"bought, the wedding tour was planned out, the wedding guests were","Great Expectations"
"invited. The day came, but not the bridegroom. He wrote her a letter—”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Which she received,” I struck in, “when she was dressing for her","Great Expectations"
"marriage? At twenty minutes to nine?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“At the hour and minute,” said Herbert, nodding, “at which she","Great Expectations"
"afterwards stopped all the clocks. What was in it, further than that it","Great Expectations"
"most heartlessly broke the marriage off, I can’t tell you, because I","Great Expectations"
"don’t know. When she recovered from a bad illness that she had, she","Great Expectations"
"laid the whole place waste, as you have seen it, and she has never","Great Expectations"
"since looked upon the light of day.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Is that all the story?” I asked, after considering it.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“All I know of it; and indeed I only know so much, through piecing it","Great Expectations"
"out for myself; for my father always avoids it, and, even when Miss","Great Expectations"
"Havisham invited me to go there, told me no more of it than it was","Great Expectations"
"absolutely requisite I should understand. But I have forgotten one","Great Expectations"
"thing. It has been supposed that the man to whom she gave her misplaced","Great Expectations"
"confidence acted throughout in concert with her half-brother; that it","Great Expectations"
"was a conspiracy between them; and that they shared the profits.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I wonder he didn’t marry her and get all the property,” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“He may have been married already, and her cruel mortification may have","Great Expectations"
"been a part of her half-brother’s scheme,” said Herbert. “Mind! I don’t","Great Expectations"
"know that.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What became of the two men?” I asked, after again considering the","Great Expectations"
"subject.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“They fell into deeper shame and degradation—if there can be deeper—and","Great Expectations"
"ruin.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Are they alive now?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I don’t know.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You said just now that Estella was not related to Miss Havisham, but","Great Expectations"
"adopted. When adopted?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Herbert shrugged his shoulders. “There has always been an Estella,","Great Expectations"
"since I have heard of a Miss Havisham. I know no more. And now,","Great Expectations"
"Handel,” said he, finally throwing off the story as it were, “there is","Great Expectations"
"a perfectly open understanding between us. All that I know about Miss","Great Expectations"
"Havisham, you know.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And all that I know,” I retorted, “you know.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I fully believe it. So there can be no competition or perplexity","Great Expectations"
"between you and me. And as to the condition on which you hold your","Great Expectations"
"advancement in life,—namely, that you are not to inquire or discuss to","Great Expectations"
"whom you owe it,—you may be very sure that it will never be encroached","Great Expectations"
"upon, or even approached, by me, or by any one belonging to me.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"In truth, he said this with so much delicacy, that I felt the subject","Great Expectations"
"done with, even though I should be under his father’s roof for years","Great Expectations"
"and years to come. Yet he said it with so much meaning, too, that I","Great Expectations"
"felt he as perfectly understood Miss Havisham to be my benefactress, as","Great Expectations"
"I understood the fact myself.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It had not occurred to me before, that he had led up to the theme for","Great Expectations"
"the purpose of clearing it out of our way; but we were so much the","Great Expectations"
"lighter and easier for having broached it, that I now perceived this to","Great Expectations"
"be the case. We were very gay and sociable, and I asked him, in the","Great Expectations"
"course of conversation, what he was? He replied, “A capitalist,—an","Great Expectations"
"Insurer of Ships.” I suppose he saw me glancing about the room in","Great Expectations"
"search of some tokens of Shipping, or capital, for he added, “In the","Great Expectations"
"City.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I had grand ideas of the wealth and importance of Insurers of Ships in","Great Expectations"
"the City, and I began to think with awe of having laid a young Insurer","Great Expectations"
"on his back, blackened his enterprising eye, and cut his responsible","Great Expectations"
"head open. But again there came upon me, for my relief, that odd","Great Expectations"
"impression that Herbert Pocket would never be very successful or rich.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I shall not rest satisfied with merely employing my capital in","Great Expectations"
"insuring ships. I shall buy up some good Life Assurance shares, and cut","Great Expectations"
"into the Direction. I shall also do a little in the mining way. None of","Great Expectations"
"these things will interfere with my chartering a few thousand tons on","Great Expectations"
"my own account. I think I shall trade,” said he, leaning back in his","Great Expectations"
"chair, “to the East Indies, for silks, shawls, spices, dyes, drugs, and","Great Expectations"
"precious woods. It’s an interesting trade.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And the profits are large?” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Tremendous!” said he.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I wavered again, and began to think here were greater expectations than","Great Expectations"
"my own.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"[Illustration]","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I think I shall trade, also,” said he, putting his thumbs in his","Great Expectations"
"waist-coat pockets, “to the West Indies, for sugar, tobacco, and rum.","Great Expectations"
"Also to Ceylon, especially for elephants’ tusks.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You will want a good many ships,” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“A perfect fleet,” said he.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Quite overpowered by the magnificence of these transactions, I asked","Great Expectations"
"him where the ships he insured mostly traded to at present?","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I haven’t begun insuring yet,” he replied. “I am looking about me.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Somehow, that pursuit seemed more in keeping with Barnard’s Inn. I said","Great Expectations"
"(in a tone of conviction), “Ah-h!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes. I am in a counting-house, and looking about me.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Is a counting-house profitable?” I asked.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“To—do you mean to the young fellow who’s in it?” he asked, in reply.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes; to you.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Why, n-no; not to me.” He said this with the air of one carefully","Great Expectations"
"reckoning up and striking a balance. “Not directly profitable. That is,","Great Expectations"
"it doesn’t pay me anything, and I have to—keep myself.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"This certainly had not a profitable appearance, and I shook my head as","Great Expectations"
"if I would imply that it would be difficult to lay by much accumulative","Great Expectations"
"capital from such a source of income.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“But the thing is,” said Herbert Pocket, “that you look about you.","Great Expectations"
"_That’s_ the grand thing. You are in a counting-house, you know, and","Great Expectations"
"you look about you.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It struck me as a singular implication that you couldn’t be out of a","Great Expectations"
"counting-house, you know, and look about you; but I silently deferred","Great Expectations"
"to his experience.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Then the time comes,” said Herbert, “when you see your opening. And","Great Expectations"
"you go in, and you swoop upon it and you make your capital, and then","Great Expectations"
"there you are! When you have once made your capital, you have nothing","Great Expectations"
"to do but employ it.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"This was very like his way of conducting that encounter in the garden;","Great Expectations"
"very like. His manner of bearing his poverty, too, exactly corresponded","Great Expectations"
"to his manner of bearing that defeat. It seemed to me that he took all","Great Expectations"
"blows and buffets now with just the same air as he had taken mine then.","Great Expectations"
"It was evident that he had nothing around him but the simplest","Great Expectations"
"necessaries, for everything that I remarked upon turned out to have","Great Expectations"
"been sent in on my account from the coffee-house or somewhere else.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Yet, having already made his fortune in his own mind, he was so","Great Expectations"
"unassuming with it that I felt quite grateful to him for not being","Great Expectations"
"puffed up. It was a pleasant addition to his naturally pleasant ways,","Great Expectations"
"and we got on famously. In the evening we went out for a walk in the","Great Expectations"
"streets, and went half-price to the Theatre; and next day we went to","Great Expectations"
"church at Westminster Abbey, and in the afternoon we walked in the","Great Expectations"
"Parks; and I wondered who shod all the horses there, and wished Joe","Great Expectations"
"did.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"On a moderate computation, it was many months, that Sunday, since I had","Great Expectations"
"left Joe and Biddy. The space interposed between myself and them","Great Expectations"
"partook of that expansion, and our marshes were any distance off. That","Great Expectations"
"I could have been at our old church in my old church-going clothes, on","Great Expectations"
"the very last Sunday that ever was, seemed a combination of","Great Expectations"
"impossibilities, geographical and social, solar and lunar. Yet in the","Great Expectations"
"London streets so crowded with people and so brilliantly lighted in the","Great Expectations"
"dusk of evening, there were depressing hints of reproaches for that I","Great Expectations"
"had put the poor old kitchen at home so far away; and in the dead of","Great Expectations"
"night, the footsteps of some incapable impostor of a porter mooning","Great Expectations"
"about Barnard’s Inn, under pretence of watching it, fell hollow on my","Great Expectations"
"heart.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"On the Monday morning at a quarter before nine, Herbert went to the","Great Expectations"
"counting-house to report himself,—to look about him, too, I","Great Expectations"
"suppose,—and I bore him company. He was to come away in an hour or two","Great Expectations"
"to attend me to Hammersmith, and I was to wait about for him. It","Great Expectations"
"appeared to me that the eggs from which young Insurers were hatched","Great Expectations"
"were incubated in dust and heat, like the eggs of ostriches, judging","Great Expectations"
"from the places to which those incipient giants repaired on a Monday","Great Expectations"
"morning. Nor did the counting-house where Herbert assisted, show in my","Great Expectations"
"eyes as at all a good Observatory; being a back second floor up a yard,","Great Expectations"
"of a grimy presence in all particulars, and with a look into another","Great Expectations"
"back second floor, rather than a look out.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I waited about until it was noon, and I went upon ’Change, and I saw","Great Expectations"
"fluey men sitting there under the bills about shipping, whom I took to","Great Expectations"
"be great merchants, though I couldn’t understand why they should all be","Great Expectations"
"out of spirits. When Herbert came, we went and had lunch at a","Great Expectations"
"celebrated house which I then quite venerated, but now believe to have","Great Expectations"
"been the most abject superstition in Europe, and where I could not help","Great Expectations"
"noticing, even then, that there was much more gravy on the tablecloths","Great Expectations"
"and knives and waiters’ clothes, than in the steaks. This collation","Great Expectations"
"disposed of at a moderate price (considering the grease, which was not","Great Expectations"
"charged for), we went back to Barnard’s Inn and got my little","Great Expectations"
"portmanteau, and then took coach for Hammersmith. We arrived there at","Great Expectations"
"two or three o’clock in the afternoon, and had very little way to walk","Great Expectations"
"to Mr. Pocket’s house. Lifting the latch of a gate, we passed direct","Great Expectations"
"into a little garden overlooking the river, where Mr. Pocket’s children","Great Expectations"
"were playing about. And unless I deceive myself on a point where my","Great Expectations"
"interests or prepossessions are certainly not concerned, I saw that Mr.","Great Expectations"
"and Mrs. Pocket’s children were not growing up or being brought up, but","Great Expectations"
"were tumbling up.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mrs. Pocket was sitting on a garden chair under a tree, reading, with","Great Expectations"
"her legs upon another garden chair; and Mrs. Pocket’s two nurse-maids","Great Expectations"
"were looking about them while the children played. “Mamma,” said","Great Expectations"
"Herbert, “this is young Mr. Pip.” Upon which Mrs. Pocket received me","Great Expectations"
"with an appearance of amiable dignity.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Master Alick and Miss Jane,” cried one of the nurses to two of the","Great Expectations"
"children, “if you go a bouncing up against them bushes you’ll fall over","Great Expectations"
"into the river and be drownded, and what’ll your pa say then?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"At the same time this nurse picked up Mrs. Pocket’s handkerchief, and","Great Expectations"
"said, “If that don’t make six times you’ve dropped it, Mum!” Upon which","Great Expectations"
"Mrs. Pocket laughed and said, “Thank you, Flopson,” and settling","Great Expectations"
"herself in one chair only, resumed her book. Her countenance","Great Expectations"
"immediately assumed a knitted and intent expression as if she had been","Great Expectations"
"reading for a week, but before she could have read half a dozen lines,","Great Expectations"
"she fixed her eyes upon me, and said, “I hope your mamma is quite","Great Expectations"
"well?” This unexpected inquiry put me into such a difficulty that I","Great Expectations"
"began saying in the absurdest way that if there had been any such","Great Expectations"
"person I had no doubt she would have been quite well and would have","Great Expectations"
"been very much obliged and would have sent her compliments, when the","Great Expectations"
"nurse came to my rescue.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well!” she cried, picking up the pocket-handkerchief, “if that don’t","Great Expectations"
"make seven times! What ARE you a-doing of this afternoon, Mum!” Mrs.","Great Expectations"
"Pocket received her property, at first with a look of unutterable","Great Expectations"
"surprise as if she had never seen it before, and then with a laugh of","Great Expectations"
"recognition, and said, “Thank you, Flopson,” and forgot me, and went on","Great Expectations"
"reading.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I found, now I had leisure to count them, that there were no fewer than","Great Expectations"
"six little Pockets present, in various stages of tumbling up. I had","Great Expectations"
"scarcely arrived at the total when a seventh was heard, as in the","Great Expectations"
"region of air, wailing dolefully.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“If there ain’t Baby!” said Flopson, appearing to think it most","Great Expectations"
"surprising. “Make haste up, Millers.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Millers, who was the other nurse, retired into the house, and by","Great Expectations"
"degrees the child’s wailing was hushed and stopped, as if it were a","Great Expectations"
"young ventriloquist with something in its mouth. Mrs. Pocket read all","Great Expectations"
"the time, and I was curious to know what the book could be.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We were waiting, I supposed, for Mr. Pocket to come out to us; at any","Great Expectations"
"rate we waited there, and so I had an opportunity of observing the","Great Expectations"
"remarkable family phenomenon that whenever any of the children strayed","Great Expectations"
"near Mrs. Pocket in their play, they always tripped themselves up and","Great Expectations"
"tumbled over her,—always very much to her momentary astonishment, and","Great Expectations"
"their own more enduring lamentation. I was at a loss to account for","Great Expectations"
"this surprising circumstance, and could not help giving my mind to","Great Expectations"
"speculations about it, until by and by Millers came down with the baby,","Great Expectations"
"which baby was handed to Flopson, which Flopson was handing it to Mrs.","Great Expectations"
"Pocket, when she too went fairly head foremost over Mrs. Pocket, baby","Great Expectations"
"and all, and was caught by Herbert and myself.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Gracious me, Flopson!” said Mrs. Pocket, looking off her book for a","Great Expectations"
"moment, “everybody’s tumbling!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Gracious you, indeed, Mum!” returned Flopson, very red in the face;","Great Expectations"
"“what have you got there?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“_I_ got here, Flopson?” asked Mrs. Pocket.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Why, if it ain’t your footstool!” cried Flopson. “And if you keep it","Great Expectations"
"under your skirts like that, who’s to help tumbling? Here! Take the","Great Expectations"
"baby, Mum, and give me your book.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mrs. Pocket acted on the advice, and inexpertly danced the infant a","Great Expectations"
"little in her lap, while the other children played about it. This had","Great Expectations"
"lasted but a very short time, when Mrs. Pocket issued summary orders","Great Expectations"
"that they were all to be taken into the house for a nap. Thus I made","Great Expectations"
"the second discovery on that first occasion, that the nurture of the","Great Expectations"
"little Pockets consisted of alternately tumbling up and lying down.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Under these circumstances, when Flopson and Millers had got the","Great Expectations"
"children into the house, like a little flock of sheep, and Mr. Pocket","Great Expectations"
"came out of it to make my acquaintance, I was not much surprised to","Great Expectations"
"find that Mr. Pocket was a gentleman with a rather perplexed expression","Great Expectations"
"of face, and with his very grey hair disordered on his head, as if he","Great Expectations"
"didn’t quite see his way to putting anything straight.","Great Expectations"

"Chapter XXIII.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Pocket said he was glad to see me, and he hoped I was not sorry to","Great Expectations"
"see him. “For, I really am not,” he added, with his son’s smile, “an","Great Expectations"
"alarming personage.” He was a young-looking man, in spite of his","Great Expectations"
"perplexities and his very grey hair, and his manner seemed quite","Great Expectations"
"natural. I use the word natural, in the sense of its being unaffected;","Great Expectations"
"there was something comic in his distraught way, as though it would","Great Expectations"
"have been downright ludicrous but for his own perception that it was","Great Expectations"
"very near being so. When he had talked with me a little, he said to","Great Expectations"
"Mrs. Pocket, with a rather anxious contraction of his eyebrows, which","Great Expectations"
"were black and handsome, “Belinda, I hope you have welcomed Mr. Pip?”","Great Expectations"
"And she looked up from her book, and said, “Yes.” She then smiled upon","Great Expectations"
"me in an absent state of mind, and asked me if I liked the taste of","Great Expectations"
"orange-flower water? As the question had no bearing, near or remote, on","Great Expectations"
"any foregone or subsequent transaction, I consider it to have been","Great Expectations"
"thrown out, like her previous approaches, in general conversational","Great Expectations"
"condescension.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I found out within a few hours, and may mention at once, that Mrs.","Great Expectations"
"Pocket was the only daughter of a certain quite accidental deceased","Great Expectations"
"Knight, who had invented for himself a conviction that his deceased","Great Expectations"
"father would have been made a Baronet but for somebody’s determined","Great Expectations"
"opposition arising out of entirely personal motives,—I forget whose, if","Great Expectations"
"I ever knew,—the Sovereign’s, the Prime Minister’s, the Lord","Great Expectations"
"Chancellor’s, the Archbishop of Canterbury’s, anybody’s,—and had tacked","Great Expectations"
"himself on to the nobles of the earth in right of this quite","Great Expectations"
"supposititious fact. I believe he had been knighted himself for","Great Expectations"
"storming the English grammar at the point of the pen, in a desperate","Great Expectations"
"address engrossed on vellum, on the occasion of the laying of the first","Great Expectations"
"stone of some building or other, and for handing some Royal Personage","Great Expectations"
"either the trowel or the mortar. Be that as it may, he had directed","Great Expectations"
"Mrs. Pocket to be brought up from her cradle as one who in the nature","Great Expectations"
"of things must marry a title, and who was to be guarded from the","Great Expectations"
"acquisition of plebeian domestic knowledge.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"So successful a watch and ward had been established over the young lady","Great Expectations"
"by this judicious parent, that she had grown up highly ornamental, but","Great Expectations"
"perfectly helpless and useless. With her character thus happily formed,","Great Expectations"
"in the first bloom of her youth she had encountered Mr. Pocket: who was","Great Expectations"
"also in the first bloom of youth, and not quite decided whether to","Great Expectations"
"mount to the Woolsack, or to roof himself in with a mitre. As his doing","Great Expectations"
"the one or the other was a mere question of time, he and Mrs. Pocket","Great Expectations"
"had taken Time by the forelock (when, to judge from its length, it","Great Expectations"
"would seem to have wanted cutting), and had married without the","Great Expectations"
"knowledge of the judicious parent. The judicious parent, having nothing","Great Expectations"
"to bestow or withhold but his blessing, had handsomely settled that","Great Expectations"
"dower upon them after a short struggle, and had informed Mr. Pocket","Great Expectations"
"that his wife was “a treasure for a Prince.” Mr. Pocket had invested","Great Expectations"
"the Prince’s treasure in the ways of the world ever since, and it was","Great Expectations"
"supposed to have brought him in but indifferent interest. Still, Mrs.","Great Expectations"
"Pocket was in general the object of a queer sort of respectful pity,","Great Expectations"
"because she had not married a title; while Mr. Pocket was the object of","Great Expectations"
"a queer sort of forgiving reproach, because he had never got one.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Pocket took me into the house and showed me my room: which was a","Great Expectations"
"pleasant one, and so furnished as that I could use it with comfort for","Great Expectations"
"my own private sitting-room. He then knocked at the doors of two other","Great Expectations"
"similar rooms, and introduced me to their occupants, by name Drummle","Great Expectations"
"and Startop. Drummle, an old-looking young man of a heavy order of","Great Expectations"
"architecture, was whistling. Startop, younger in years and appearance,","Great Expectations"
"was reading and holding his head, as if he thought himself in danger of","Great Expectations"
"exploding it with too strong a charge of knowledge.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Both Mr. and Mrs. Pocket had such a noticeable air of being in somebody","Great Expectations"
"else’s hands, that I wondered who really was in possession of the house","Great Expectations"
"and let them live there, until I found this unknown power to be the","Great Expectations"
"servants. It was a smooth way of going on, perhaps, in respect of","Great Expectations"
"saving trouble; but it had the appearance of being expensive, for the","Great Expectations"
"servants felt it a duty they owed to themselves to be nice in their","Great Expectations"
"eating and drinking, and to keep a deal of company downstairs. They","Great Expectations"
"allowed a very liberal table to Mr. and Mrs. Pocket, yet it always","Great Expectations"
"appeared to me that by far the best part of the house to have boarded","Great Expectations"
"in would have been the kitchen,—always supposing the boarder capable of","Great Expectations"
"self-defence, for, before I had been there a week, a neighbouring lady","Great Expectations"
"with whom the family were personally unacquainted, wrote in to say that","Great Expectations"
"she had seen Millers slapping the baby. This greatly distressed Mrs.","Great Expectations"
"Pocket, who burst into tears on receiving the note, and said that it","Great Expectations"
"was an extraordinary thing that the neighbours couldn’t mind their own","Great Expectations"
"business.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"By degrees I learnt, and chiefly from Herbert, that Mr. Pocket had been","Great Expectations"
"educated at Harrow and at Cambridge, where he had distinguished","Great Expectations"
"himself; but that when he had had the happiness of marrying Mrs. Pocket","Great Expectations"
"very early in life, he had impaired his prospects and taken up the","Great Expectations"
"calling of a Grinder. After grinding a number of dull blades,—of whom","Great Expectations"
"it was remarkable that their fathers, when influential, were always","Great Expectations"
"going to help him to preferment, but always forgot to do it when the","Great Expectations"
"blades had left the Grindstone,—he had wearied of that poor work and","Great Expectations"
"had come to London. Here, after gradually failing in loftier hopes, he","Great Expectations"
"had “read” with divers who had lacked opportunities or neglected them,","Great Expectations"
"and had refurbished divers others for special occasions, and had turned","Great Expectations"
"his acquirements to the account of literary compilation and correction,","Great Expectations"
"and on such means, added to some very moderate private resources, still","Great Expectations"
"maintained the house I saw.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mr. and Mrs. Pocket had a toady neighbour; a widow lady of that highly","Great Expectations"
"sympathetic nature that she agreed with everybody, blessed everybody,","Great Expectations"
"and shed smiles and tears on everybody, according to circumstances.","Great Expectations"
"This lady’s name was Mrs. Coiler, and I had the honour of taking her","Great Expectations"
"down to dinner on the day of my installation. She gave me to understand","Great Expectations"
"on the stairs, that it was a blow to dear Mrs. Pocket that dear Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Pocket should be under the necessity of receiving gentlemen to read","Great Expectations"
"with him. That did not extend to me, she told me in a gush of love and","Great Expectations"
"confidence (at that time, I had known her something less than five","Great Expectations"
"minutes); if they were all like Me, it would be quite another thing.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“But dear Mrs. Pocket,” said Mrs. Coiler, “after her early","Great Expectations"
"disappointment (not that dear Mr. Pocket was to blame in that),","Great Expectations"
"requires so much luxury and elegance—”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, ma’am,” I said, to stop her, for I was afraid she was going to","Great Expectations"
"cry.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And she is of so aristocratic a disposition—”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, ma’am,” I said again, with the same object as before.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“—That it _is_ hard,” said Mrs. Coiler, “to have dear Mr. Pocket’s time","Great Expectations"
"and attention diverted from dear Mrs. Pocket.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I could not help thinking that it might be harder if the butcher’s time","Great Expectations"
"and attention were diverted from dear Mrs. Pocket; but I said nothing,","Great Expectations"
"and indeed had enough to do in keeping a bashful watch upon my company","Great Expectations"
"manners.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It came to my knowledge, through what passed between Mrs. Pocket and","Great Expectations"
"Drummle while I was attentive to my knife and fork, spoon, glasses, and","Great Expectations"
"other instruments of self-destruction, that Drummle, whose Christian","Great Expectations"
"name was Bentley, was actually the next heir but one to a baronetcy. It","Great Expectations"
"further appeared that the book I had seen Mrs. Pocket reading in the","Great Expectations"
"garden was all about titles, and that she knew the exact date at which","Great Expectations"
"her grandpapa would have come into the book, if he ever had come at","Great Expectations"
"all. Drummle didn’t say much, but in his limited way (he struck me as a","Great Expectations"
"sulky kind of fellow) he spoke as one of the elect, and recognised Mrs.","Great Expectations"
"Pocket as a woman and a sister. No one but themselves and Mrs. Coiler","Great Expectations"
"the toady neighbour showed any interest in this part of the","Great Expectations"
"conversation, and it appeared to me that it was painful to Herbert; but","Great Expectations"
"it promised to last a long time, when the page came in with the","Great Expectations"
"announcement of a domestic affliction. It was, in effect, that the cook","Great Expectations"
"had mislaid the beef. To my unutterable amazement, I now, for the first","Great Expectations"
"time, saw Mr. Pocket relieve his mind by going through a performance","Great Expectations"
"that struck me as very extraordinary, but which made no impression on","Great Expectations"
"anybody else, and with which I soon became as familiar as the rest. He","Great Expectations"
"laid down the carving-knife and fork,—being engaged in carving, at the","Great Expectations"
"moment,—put his two hands into his disturbed hair, and appeared to make","Great Expectations"
"an extraordinary effort to lift himself up by it. When he had done","Great Expectations"
"this, and had not lifted himself up at all, he quietly went on with","Great Expectations"
"what he was about.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mrs. Coiler then changed the subject and began to flatter me. I liked","Great Expectations"
"it for a few moments, but she flattered me so very grossly that the","Great Expectations"
"pleasure was soon over. She had a serpentine way of coming close at me","Great Expectations"
"when she pretended to be vitally interested in the friends and","Great Expectations"
"localities I had left, which was altogether snaky and fork-tongued; and","Great Expectations"
"when she made an occasional bounce upon Startop (who said very little","Great Expectations"
"to her), or upon Drummle (who said less), I rather envied them for","Great Expectations"
"being on the opposite side of the table.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"After dinner the children were introduced, and Mrs. Coiler made","Great Expectations"
"admiring comments on their eyes, noses, and legs,—a sagacious way of","Great Expectations"
"improving their minds. There were four little girls, and two little","Great Expectations"
"boys, besides the baby who might have been either, and the baby’s next","Great Expectations"
"successor who was as yet neither. They were brought in by Flopson and","Great Expectations"
"Millers, much as though those two non-commissioned officers had been","Great Expectations"
"recruiting somewhere for children and had enlisted these, while Mrs.","Great Expectations"
"Pocket looked at the young Nobles that ought to have been as if she","Great Expectations"
"rather thought she had had the pleasure of inspecting them before, but","Great Expectations"
"didn’t quite know what to make of them.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Here! Give me your fork, Mum, and take the baby,” said Flopson. “Don’t","Great Expectations"
"take it that way, or you’ll get its head under the table.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Thus advised, Mrs. Pocket took it the other way, and got its head upon","Great Expectations"
"the table; which was announced to all present by a prodigious","Great Expectations"
"concussion.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Dear, dear! Give it me back, Mum,” said Flopson; “and Miss Jane, come","Great Expectations"
"and dance to baby, do!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"One of the little girls, a mere mite who seemed to have prematurely","Great Expectations"
"taken upon herself some charge of the others, stepped out of her place","Great Expectations"
"by me, and danced to and from the baby until it left off crying, and","Great Expectations"
"laughed. Then, all the children laughed, and Mr. Pocket (who in the","Great Expectations"
"meantime had twice endeavoured to lift himself up by the hair) laughed,","Great Expectations"
"and we all laughed and were glad.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Flopson, by dint of doubling the baby at the joints like a Dutch doll,","Great Expectations"
"then got it safely into Mrs. Pocket’s lap, and gave it the nut-crackers","Great Expectations"
"to play with; at the same time recommending Mrs. Pocket to take notice","Great Expectations"
"that the handles of that instrument were not likely to agree with its","Great Expectations"
"eyes, and sharply charging Miss Jane to look after the same. Then, the","Great Expectations"
"two nurses left the room, and had a lively scuffle on the staircase","Great Expectations"
"with a dissipated page who had waited at dinner, and who had clearly","Great Expectations"
"lost half his buttons at the gaming-table.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I was made very uneasy in my mind by Mrs. Pocket’s falling into a","Great Expectations"
"discussion with Drummle respecting two baronetcies, while she ate a","Great Expectations"
"sliced orange steeped in sugar and wine, and, forgetting all about the","Great Expectations"
"baby on her lap, who did most appalling things with the nut-crackers.","Great Expectations"
"At length little Jane, perceiving its young brains to be imperilled,","Great Expectations"
"softly left her place, and with many small artifices coaxed the","Great Expectations"
"dangerous weapon away. Mrs. Pocket finishing her orange at about the","Great Expectations"
"same time, and not approving of this, said to Jane,—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You naughty child, how dare you? Go and sit down this instant!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Mamma dear,” lisped the little girl, “baby ood have put hith eyeth","Great Expectations"
"out.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“How dare you tell me so?” retorted Mrs. Pocket. “Go and sit down in","Great Expectations"
"your chair this moment!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mrs. Pocket’s dignity was so crushing, that I felt quite abashed, as if","Great Expectations"
"I myself had done something to rouse it.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Belinda,” remonstrated Mr. Pocket, from the other end of the table,","Great Expectations"
"“how can you be so unreasonable? Jane only interfered for the","Great Expectations"
"protection of baby.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I will not allow anybody to interfere,” said Mrs. Pocket. “I am","Great Expectations"
"surprised, Matthew, that you should expose me to the affront of","Great Expectations"
"interference.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Good God!” cried Mr. Pocket, in an outbreak of desolate desperation.","Great Expectations"
"“Are infants to be nut-crackered into their tombs, and is nobody to","Great Expectations"
"save them?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I will not be interfered with by Jane,” said Mrs. Pocket, with a","Great Expectations"
"majestic glance at that innocent little offender. “I hope I know my","Great Expectations"
"poor grandpapa’s position. Jane, indeed!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Pocket got his hands in his hair again, and this time really did","Great Expectations"
"lift himself some inches out of his chair. “Hear this!” he helplessly","Great Expectations"
"exclaimed to the elements. “Babies are to be nut-crackered dead, for","Great Expectations"
"people’s poor grandpapa’s positions!” Then he let himself down again,","Great Expectations"
"and became silent.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We all looked awkwardly at the tablecloth while this was going on. A","Great Expectations"
"pause succeeded, during which the honest and irrepressible baby made a","Great Expectations"
"series of leaps and crows at little Jane, who appeared to me to be the","Great Expectations"
"only member of the family (irrespective of servants) with whom it had","Great Expectations"
"any decided acquaintance.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Mr. Drummle,” said Mrs. Pocket, “will you ring for Flopson? Jane, you","Great Expectations"
"undutiful little thing, go and lie down. Now, baby darling, come with","Great Expectations"
"ma!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The baby was the soul of honour, and protested with all its might. It","Great Expectations"
"doubled itself up the wrong way over Mrs. Pocket’s arm, exhibited a","Great Expectations"
"pair of knitted shoes and dimpled ankles to the company in lieu of its","Great Expectations"
"soft face, and was carried out in the highest state of mutiny. And it","Great Expectations"
"gained its point after all, for I saw it through the window within a","Great Expectations"
"few minutes, being nursed by little Jane.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It happened that the other five children were left behind at the","Great Expectations"
"dinner-table, through Flopson’s having some private engagement, and","Great Expectations"
"their not being anybody else’s business. I thus became aware of the","Great Expectations"
"mutual relations between them and Mr. Pocket, which were exemplified in","Great Expectations"
"the following manner. Mr. Pocket, with the normal perplexity of his","Great Expectations"
"face heightened and his hair rumpled, looked at them for some minutes,","Great Expectations"
"as if he couldn’t make out how they came to be boarding and lodging in","Great Expectations"
"that establishment, and why they hadn’t been billeted by Nature on","Great Expectations"
"somebody else. Then, in a distant Missionary way he asked them certain","Great Expectations"
"questions,—as why little Joe had that hole in his frill, who said, Pa,","Great Expectations"
"Flopson was going to mend it when she had time,—and how little Fanny","Great Expectations"
"came by that whitlow, who said, Pa, Millers was going to poultice it","Great Expectations"
"when she didn’t forget. Then, he melted into parental tenderness, and","Great Expectations"
"gave them a shilling apiece and told them to go and play; and then as","Great Expectations"
"they went out, with one very strong effort to lift himself up by the","Great Expectations"
"hair he dismissed the hopeless subject.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"In the evening there was rowing on the river. As Drummle and Startop","Great Expectations"
"had each a boat, I resolved to set up mine, and to cut them both out. I","Great Expectations"
"was pretty good at most exercises in which country boys are adepts, but","Great Expectations"
"as I was conscious of wanting elegance of style for the Thames,—not to","Great Expectations"
"say for other waters,—I at once engaged to place myself under the","Great Expectations"
"tuition of the winner of a prize-wherry who plied at our stairs, and to","Great Expectations"
"whom I was introduced by my new allies. This practical authority","Great Expectations"
"confused me very much by saying I had the arm of a blacksmith. If he","Great Expectations"
"could have known how nearly the compliment lost him his pupil, I doubt","Great Expectations"
"if he would have paid it.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"There was a supper-tray after we got home at night, and I think we","Great Expectations"
"should all have enjoyed ourselves, but for a rather disagreeable","Great Expectations"
"domestic occurrence. Mr. Pocket was in good spirits, when a housemaid","Great Expectations"
"came in, and said, “If you please, sir, I should wish to speak to you.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Speak to your master?” said Mrs. Pocket, whose dignity was roused","Great Expectations"
"again. “How can you think of such a thing? Go and speak to Flopson. Or","Great Expectations"
"speak to me—at some other time.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Begging your pardon, ma’am,” returned the housemaid, “I should wish to","Great Expectations"
"speak at once, and to speak to master.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Hereupon, Mr. Pocket went out of the room, and we made the best of","Great Expectations"
"ourselves until he came back.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“This is a pretty thing, Belinda!” said Mr. Pocket, returning with a","Great Expectations"
"countenance expressive of grief and despair. “Here’s the cook lying","Great Expectations"
"insensibly drunk on the kitchen floor, with a large bundle of fresh","Great Expectations"
"butter made up in the cupboard ready to sell for grease!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mrs. Pocket instantly showed much amiable emotion, and said, “This is","Great Expectations"
"that odious Sophia’s doing!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What do you mean, Belinda?” demanded Mr. Pocket.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Sophia has told you,” said Mrs. Pocket. “Did I not see her with my own","Great Expectations"
"eyes and hear her with my own ears, come into the room just now and ask","Great Expectations"
"to speak to you?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“But has she not taken me downstairs, Belinda,” returned Mr. Pocket,","Great Expectations"
"“and shown me the woman, and the bundle too?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And do you defend her, Matthew,” said Mrs. Pocket, “for making","Great Expectations"
"mischief?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Pocket uttered a dismal groan.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Am I, grandpapa’s granddaughter, to be nothing in the house?” said","Great Expectations"
"Mrs. Pocket. “Besides, the cook has always been a very nice respectful","Great Expectations"
"woman, and said in the most natural manner when she came to look after","Great Expectations"
"the situation, that she felt I was born to be a Duchess.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"There was a sofa where Mr. Pocket stood, and he dropped upon it in the","Great Expectations"
"attitude of the Dying Gladiator. Still in that attitude he said, with a","Great Expectations"
"hollow voice, “Good night, Mr. Pip,” when I deemed it advisable to go","Great Expectations"
"to bed and leave him.","Great Expectations"

"Chapter XXIV.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"After two or three days, when I had established myself in my room and","Great Expectations"
"had gone backwards and forwards to London several times, and had","Great Expectations"
"ordered all I wanted of my tradesmen, Mr. Pocket and I had a long talk","Great Expectations"
"together. He knew more of my intended career than I knew myself, for he","Great Expectations"
"referred to his having been told by Mr. Jaggers that I was not designed","Great Expectations"
"for any profession, and that I should be well enough educated for my","Great Expectations"
"destiny if I could “hold my own” with the average of young men in","Great Expectations"
"prosperous circumstances. I acquiesced, of course, knowing nothing to","Great Expectations"
"the contrary.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He advised my attending certain places in London, for the acquisition","Great Expectations"
"of such mere rudiments as I wanted, and my investing him with the","Great Expectations"
"functions of explainer and director of all my studies. He hoped that","Great Expectations"
"with intelligent assistance I should meet with little to discourage me,","Great Expectations"
"and should soon be able to dispense with any aid but his. Through his","Great Expectations"
"way of saying this, and much more to similar purpose, he placed himself","Great Expectations"
"on confidential terms with me in an admirable manner; and I may state","Great Expectations"
"at once that he was always so zealous and honourable in fulfilling his","Great Expectations"
"compact with me, that he made me zealous and honourable in fulfilling","Great Expectations"
"mine with him. If he had shown indifference as a master, I have no","Great Expectations"
"doubt I should have returned the compliment as a pupil; he gave me no","Great Expectations"
"such excuse, and each of us did the other justice. Nor did I ever","Great Expectations"
"regard him as having anything ludicrous about him—or anything but what","Great Expectations"
"was serious, honest, and good—in his tutor communication with me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"When these points were settled, and so far carried out as that I had","Great Expectations"
"begun to work in earnest, it occurred to me that if I could retain my","Great Expectations"
"bedroom in Barnard’s Inn, my life would be agreeably varied, while my","Great Expectations"
"manners would be none the worse for Herbert’s society. Mr. Pocket did","Great Expectations"
"not object to this arrangement, but urged that before any step could","Great Expectations"
"possibly be taken in it, it must be submitted to my guardian. I felt","Great Expectations"
"that this delicacy arose out of the consideration that the plan would","Great Expectations"
"save Herbert some expense, so I went off to Little Britain and imparted","Great Expectations"
"my wish to Mr. Jaggers.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“If I could buy the furniture now hired for me,” said I, “and one or","Great Expectations"
"two other little things, I should be quite at home there.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Go it!” said Mr. Jaggers, with a short laugh. “I told you you’d get","Great Expectations"
"on. Well! How much do you want?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I said I didn’t know how much.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Come!” retorted Mr. Jaggers. “How much? Fifty pounds?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“O, not nearly so much.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Five pounds?” said Mr. Jaggers.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"This was such a great fall, that I said in discomfiture, “O, more than","Great Expectations"
"that.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“More than that, eh!” retorted Mr. Jaggers, lying in wait for me, with","Great Expectations"
"his hands in his pockets, his head on one side, and his eyes on the","Great Expectations"
"wall behind me; “how much more?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It is so difficult to fix a sum,” said I, hesitating.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Come!” said Mr. Jaggers. “Let’s get at it. Twice five; will that do?","Great Expectations"
"Three times five; will that do? Four times five; will that do?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I said I thought that would do handsomely.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Four times five will do handsomely, will it?” said Mr. Jaggers,","Great Expectations"
"knitting his brows. “Now, what do you make of four times five?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What do I make of it?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Ah!” said Mr. Jaggers; “how much?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I suppose you make it twenty pounds,” said I, smiling.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Never mind what _I_ make it, my friend,” observed Mr. Jaggers, with a","Great Expectations"
"knowing and contradictory toss of his head. “I want to know what _you_","Great Expectations"
"make it.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Twenty pounds, of course.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Wemmick!” said Mr. Jaggers, opening his office door. “Take Mr. Pip’s","Great Expectations"
"written order, and pay him twenty pounds.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"This strongly marked way of doing business made a strongly marked","Great Expectations"
"impression on me, and that not of an agreeable kind. Mr. Jaggers never","Great Expectations"
"laughed; but he wore great bright creaking boots, and, in poising","Great Expectations"
"himself on these boots, with his large head bent down and his eyebrows","Great Expectations"
"joined together, awaiting an answer, he sometimes caused the boots to","Great Expectations"
"creak, as if _they_ laughed in a dry and suspicious way. As he happened","Great Expectations"
"to go out now, and as Wemmick was brisk and talkative, I said to","Great Expectations"
"Wemmick that I hardly knew what to make of Mr. Jaggers’s manner.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Tell him that, and he’ll take it as a compliment,” answered Wemmick;","Great Expectations"
"“he don’t mean that you _should_ know what to make of it.—Oh!” for I","Great Expectations"
"looked surprised, “it’s not personal; it’s professional: only","Great Expectations"
"professional.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Wemmick was at his desk, lunching—and crunching—on a dry hard biscuit;","Great Expectations"
"pieces of which he threw from time to time into his slit of a mouth, as","Great Expectations"
"if he were posting them.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Always seems to me,” said Wemmick, “as if he had set a man-trap and","Great Expectations"
"was watching it. Suddenly—click—you’re caught!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Without remarking that man-traps were not among the amenities of life,","Great Expectations"
"I said I supposed he was very skilful?","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Deep,” said Wemmick, “as Australia.” Pointing with his pen at the","Great Expectations"
"office floor, to express that Australia was understood, for the","Great Expectations"
"purposes of the figure, to be symmetrically on the opposite spot of the","Great Expectations"
"globe. “If there was anything deeper,” added Wemmick, bringing his pen","Great Expectations"
"to paper, “he’d be it.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Then, I said I supposed he had a fine business, and Wemmick said,","Great Expectations"
"“Ca-pi-tal!” Then I asked if there were many clerks? to which he","Great Expectations"
"replied,—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“We don’t run much into clerks, because there’s only one Jaggers, and","Great Expectations"
"people won’t have him at second hand. There are only four of us. Would","Great Expectations"
"you like to see ’em? You are one of us, as I may say.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I accepted the offer. When Mr. Wemmick had put all the biscuit into the","Great Expectations"
"post, and had paid me my money from a cash-box in a safe, the key of","Great Expectations"
"which safe he kept somewhere down his back and produced from his","Great Expectations"
"coat-collar like an iron-pigtail, we went upstairs. The house was dark","Great Expectations"
"and shabby, and the greasy shoulders that had left their mark in Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Jaggers’s room seemed to have been shuffling up and down the staircase","Great Expectations"
"for years. In the front first floor, a clerk who looked something","Great Expectations"
"between a publican and a rat-catcher—a large pale, puffed, swollen","Great Expectations"
"man—was attentively engaged with three or four people of shabby","Great Expectations"
"appearance, whom he treated as unceremoniously as everybody seemed to","Great Expectations"
"be treated who contributed to Mr. Jaggers’s coffers. “Getting evidence","Great Expectations"
"together,” said Mr. Wemmick, as we came out, “for the Bailey.” In the","Great Expectations"
"room over that, a little flabby terrier of a clerk with dangling hair","Great Expectations"
"(his cropping seemed to have been forgotten when he was a puppy) was","Great Expectations"
"similarly engaged with a man with weak eyes, whom Mr. Wemmick presented","Great Expectations"
"to me as a smelter who kept his pot always boiling, and who would melt","Great Expectations"
"me anything I pleased,—and who was in an excessive white-perspiration,","Great Expectations"
"as if he had been trying his art on himself. In a back room, a","Great Expectations"
"high-shouldered man with a face-ache tied up in dirty flannel, who was","Great Expectations"
"dressed in old black clothes that bore the appearance of having been","Great Expectations"
"waxed, was stooping over his work of making fair copies of the notes of","Great Expectations"
"the other two gentlemen, for Mr. Jaggers’s own use.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"This was all the establishment. When we went downstairs again, Wemmick","Great Expectations"
"led me into my guardian’s room, and said, “This you’ve seen already.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Pray,” said I, as the two odious casts with the twitchy leer upon them","Great Expectations"
"caught my sight again, “whose likenesses are those?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“These?” said Wemmick, getting upon a chair, and blowing the dust off","Great Expectations"
"the horrible heads before bringing them down. “These are two celebrated","Great Expectations"
"ones. Famous clients of ours that got us a world of credit. This chap","Great Expectations"
"(why you must have come down in the night and been peeping into the","Great Expectations"
"inkstand, to get this blot upon your eyebrow, you old rascal!) murdered","Great Expectations"
"his master, and, considering that he wasn’t brought up to evidence,","Great Expectations"
"didn’t plan it badly.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Is it like him?” I asked, recoiling from the brute, as Wemmick spat","Great Expectations"
"upon his eyebrow and gave it a rub with his sleeve.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Like him? It’s himself, you know. The cast was made in Newgate,","Great Expectations"
"directly after he was taken down. You had a particular fancy for me,","Great Expectations"
"hadn’t you, Old Artful?” said Wemmick. He then explained this","Great Expectations"
"affectionate apostrophe, by touching his brooch representing the lady","Great Expectations"
"and the weeping willow at the tomb with the urn upon it, and saying,","Great Expectations"
"“Had it made for me, express!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Is the lady anybody?” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No,” returned Wemmick. “Only his game. (You liked your bit of game,","Great Expectations"
"didn’t you?) No; deuce a bit of a lady in the case, Mr. Pip, except","Great Expectations"
"one,—and she wasn’t of this slender lady-like sort, and you wouldn’t","Great Expectations"
"have caught _her_ looking after this urn, unless there was something to","Great Expectations"
"drink in it.” Wemmick’s attention being thus directed to his brooch, he","Great Expectations"
"put down the cast, and polished the brooch with his","Great Expectations"
"pocket-handkerchief.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Did that other creature come to the same end?” I asked. “He has the","Great Expectations"
"same look.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You’re right,” said Wemmick; “it’s the genuine look. Much as if one","Great Expectations"
"nostril was caught up with a horse-hair and a little fish-hook. Yes, he","Great Expectations"
"came to the same end; quite the natural end here, I assure you. He","Great Expectations"
"forged wills, this blade did, if he didn’t also put the supposed","Great Expectations"
"testators to sleep too. You were a gentlemanly Cove, though” (Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Wemmick was again apostrophising), “and you said you could write Greek.","Great Expectations"
"Yah, Bounceable! What a liar you were! I never met such a liar as you!”","Great Expectations"
"Before putting his late friend on his shelf again, Wemmick touched the","Great Expectations"
"largest of his mourning rings and said, “Sent out to buy it for me,","Great Expectations"
"only the day before.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"While he was putting up the other cast and coming down from the chair,","Great Expectations"
"the thought crossed my mind that all his personal jewelry was derived","Great Expectations"
"from like sources. As he had shown no diffidence on the subject, I","Great Expectations"
"ventured on the liberty of asking him the question, when he stood","Great Expectations"
"before me, dusting his hands.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“O yes,” he returned, “these are all gifts of that kind. One brings","Great Expectations"
"another, you see; that’s the way of it. I always take ’em. They’re","Great Expectations"
"curiosities. And they’re property. They may not be worth much, but,","Great Expectations"
"after all, they’re property and portable. It don’t signify to you with","Great Expectations"
"your brilliant lookout, but as to myself, my guiding-star always is,","Great Expectations"
"‘Get hold of portable property’.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"When I had rendered homage to this light, he went on to say, in a","Great Expectations"
"friendly manner:—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“If at any odd time when you have nothing better to do, you wouldn’t","Great Expectations"
"mind coming over to see me at Walworth, I could offer you a bed, and I","Great Expectations"
"should consider it an honour. I have not much to show you; but such two","Great Expectations"
"or three curiosities as I have got you might like to look over; and I","Great Expectations"
"am fond of a bit of garden and a summer-house.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I said I should be delighted to accept his hospitality.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Thankee,” said he; “then we’ll consider that it’s to come off, when","Great Expectations"
"convenient to you. Have you dined with Mr. Jaggers yet?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Not yet.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well,” said Wemmick, “he’ll give you wine, and good wine. I’ll give","Great Expectations"
"you punch, and not bad punch. And now I’ll tell you something. When you","Great Expectations"
"go to dine with Mr. Jaggers, look at his housekeeper.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Shall I see something very uncommon?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well,” said Wemmick, “you’ll see a wild beast tamed. Not so very","Great Expectations"
"uncommon, you’ll tell me. I reply, that depends on the original","Great Expectations"
"wildness of the beast, and the amount of taming. It won’t lower your","Great Expectations"
"opinion of Mr. Jaggers’s powers. Keep your eye on it.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I told him I would do so, with all the interest and curiosity that his","Great Expectations"
"preparation awakened. As I was taking my departure, he asked me if I","Great Expectations"
"would like to devote five minutes to seeing Mr. Jaggers “at it?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"For several reasons, and not least because I didn’t clearly know what","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Jaggers would be found to be “at,” I replied in the affirmative. We","Great Expectations"
"dived into the City, and came up in a crowded police-court, where a","Great Expectations"
"blood-relation (in the murderous sense) of the deceased, with the","Great Expectations"
"fanciful taste in brooches, was standing at the bar, uncomfortably","Great Expectations"
"chewing something; while my guardian had a woman under examination or","Great Expectations"
"cross-examination,—I don’t know which,—and was striking her, and the","Great Expectations"
"bench, and everybody present, with awe. If anybody, of whatsoever","Great Expectations"
"degree, said a word that he didn’t approve of, he instantly required to","Great Expectations"
"have it “taken down.” If anybody wouldn’t make an admission, he said,","Great Expectations"
"“I’ll have it out of you!” and if anybody made an admission, he said,","Great Expectations"
"“Now I have got you!” The magistrates shivered under a single bite of","Great Expectations"
"his finger. Thieves and thief-takers hung in dread rapture on his","Great Expectations"
"words, and shrank when a hair of his eyebrows turned in their","Great Expectations"
"direction. Which side he was on I couldn’t make out, for he seemed to","Great Expectations"
"me to be grinding the whole place in a mill; I only know that when I","Great Expectations"
"stole out on tiptoe, he was not on the side of the bench; for, he was","Great Expectations"
"making the legs of the old gentleman who presided, quite convulsive","Great Expectations"
"under the table, by his denunciations of his conduct as the","Great Expectations"
"representative of British law and justice in that chair that day.","Great Expectations"

"Chapter XXV.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Bentley Drummle, who was so sulky a fellow that he even took up a book","Great Expectations"
"as if its writer had done him an injury, did not take up an","Great Expectations"
"acquaintance in a more agreeable spirit. Heavy in figure, movement, and","Great Expectations"
"comprehension,—in the sluggish complexion of his face, and in the","Great Expectations"
"large, awkward tongue that seemed to loll about in his mouth as he","Great Expectations"
"himself lolled about in a room,—he was idle, proud, niggardly,","Great Expectations"
"reserved, and suspicious. He came of rich people down in Somersetshire,","Great Expectations"
"who had nursed this combination of qualities until they made the","Great Expectations"
"discovery that it was just of age and a blockhead. Thus, Bentley","Great Expectations"
"Drummle had come to Mr. Pocket when he was a head taller than that","Great Expectations"
"gentleman, and half a dozen heads thicker than most gentlemen.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Startop had been spoilt by a weak mother and kept at home when he ought","Great Expectations"
"to have been at school, but he was devotedly attached to her, and","Great Expectations"
"admired her beyond measure. He had a woman’s delicacy of feature, and","Great Expectations"
"was—“as you may see, though you never saw her,” said Herbert to","Great Expectations"
"me—“exactly like his mother.” It was but natural that I should take to","Great Expectations"
"him much more kindly than to Drummle, and that, even in the earliest","Great Expectations"
"evenings of our boating, he and I should pull homeward abreast of one","Great Expectations"
"another, conversing from boat to boat, while Bentley Drummle came up in","Great Expectations"
"our wake alone, under the overhanging banks and among the rushes. He","Great Expectations"
"would always creep in-shore like some uncomfortable amphibious","Great Expectations"
"creature, even when the tide would have sent him fast upon his way; and","Great Expectations"
"I always think of him as coming after us in the dark or by the","Great Expectations"
"back-water, when our own two boats were breaking the sunset or the","Great Expectations"
"moonlight in mid-stream.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Herbert was my intimate companion and friend. I presented him with a","Great Expectations"
"half-share in my boat, which was the occasion of his often coming down","Great Expectations"
"to Hammersmith; and my possession of a half-share in his chambers often","Great Expectations"
"took me up to London. We used to walk between the two places at all","Great Expectations"
"hours. I have an affection for the road yet (though it is not so","Great Expectations"
"pleasant a road as it was then), formed in the impressibility of","Great Expectations"
"untried youth and hope.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"When I had been in Mr. Pocket’s family a month or two, Mr. and Mrs.","Great Expectations"
"Camilla turned up. Camilla was Mr. Pocket’s sister. Georgiana, whom I","Great Expectations"
"had seen at Miss Havisham’s on the same occasion, also turned up. She","Great Expectations"
"was a cousin,—an indigestive single woman, who called her rigidity","Great Expectations"
"religion, and her liver love. These people hated me with the hatred of","Great Expectations"
"cupidity and disappointment. As a matter of course, they fawned upon me","Great Expectations"
"in my prosperity with the basest meanness. Towards Mr. Pocket, as a","Great Expectations"
"grown-up infant with no notion of his own interests, they showed the","Great Expectations"
"complacent forbearance I had heard them express. Mrs. Pocket they held","Great Expectations"
"in contempt; but they allowed the poor soul to have been heavily","Great Expectations"
"disappointed in life, because that shed a feeble reflected light upon","Great Expectations"
"themselves.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"These were the surroundings among which I settled down, and applied","Great Expectations"
"myself to my education. I soon contracted expensive habits, and began","Great Expectations"
"to spend an amount of money that within a few short months I should","Great Expectations"
"have thought almost fabulous; but through good and evil I stuck to my","Great Expectations"
"books. There was no other merit in this, than my having sense enough to","Great Expectations"
"feel my deficiencies. Between Mr. Pocket and Herbert I got on fast;","Great Expectations"
"and, with one or the other always at my elbow to give me the start I","Great Expectations"
"wanted, and clear obstructions out of my road, I must have been as","Great Expectations"
"great a dolt as Drummle if I had done less.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I had not seen Mr. Wemmick for some weeks, when I thought I would write","Great Expectations"
"him a note and propose to go home with him on a certain evening. He","Great Expectations"
"replied that it would give him much pleasure, and that he would expect","Great Expectations"
"me at the office at six o’clock. Thither I went, and there I found him,","Great Expectations"
"putting the key of his safe down his back as the clock struck.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Did you think of walking down to Walworth?” said he.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Certainly,” said I, “if you approve.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Very much,” was Wemmick’s reply, “for I have had my legs under the","Great Expectations"
"desk all day, and shall be glad to stretch them. Now, I’ll tell you","Great Expectations"
"what I have got for supper, Mr. Pip. I have got a stewed steak,—which","Great Expectations"
"is of home preparation,—and a cold roast fowl,—which is from the","Great Expectations"
"cook’s-shop. I think it’s tender, because the master of the shop was a","Great Expectations"
"Juryman in some cases of ours the other day, and we let him down easy.","Great Expectations"
"I reminded him of it when I bought the fowl, and I said, “Pick us out a","Great Expectations"
"good one, old Briton, because if we had chosen to keep you in the box","Great Expectations"
"another day or two, we could easily have done it.” He said to that,","Great Expectations"
"“Let me make you a present of the best fowl in the shop.” I let him, of","Great Expectations"
"course. As far as it goes, it’s property and portable. You don’t object","Great Expectations"
"to an aged parent, I hope?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I really thought he was still speaking of the fowl, until he added,","Great Expectations"
"“Because I have got an aged parent at my place.” I then said what","Great Expectations"
"politeness required.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“So, you haven’t dined with Mr. Jaggers yet?” he pursued, as we walked","Great Expectations"
"along.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Not yet.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“He told me so this afternoon when he heard you were coming. I expect","Great Expectations"
"you’ll have an invitation to-morrow. He’s going to ask your pals, too.","Great Expectations"
"Three of ’em; ain’t there?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Although I was not in the habit of counting Drummle as one of my","Great Expectations"
"intimate associates, I answered, “Yes.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well, he’s going to ask the whole gang,”—I hardly felt complimented by","Great Expectations"
"the word,—“and whatever he gives you, he’ll give you good. Don’t look","Great Expectations"
"forward to variety, but you’ll have excellence. And there’s another rum","Great Expectations"
"thing in his house,” proceeded Wemmick, after a moment’s pause, as if","Great Expectations"
"the remark followed on the housekeeper understood; “he never lets a","Great Expectations"
"door or window be fastened at night.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Is he never robbed?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“That’s it!” returned Wemmick. “He says, and gives it out publicly, “I","Great Expectations"
"want to see the man who’ll rob _me_.” Lord bless you, I have heard him,","Great Expectations"
"a hundred times, if I have heard him once, say to regular cracksmen in","Great Expectations"
"our front office, “You know where I live; now, no bolt is ever drawn","Great Expectations"
"there; why don’t you do a stroke of business with me? Come; can’t I","Great Expectations"
"tempt you?” Not a man of them, sir, would be bold enough to try it on,","Great Expectations"
"for love or money.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“They dread him so much?” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Dread him,” said Wemmick. “I believe you they dread him. Not but what","Great Expectations"
"he’s artful, even in his defiance of them. No silver, sir. Britannia","Great Expectations"
"metal, every spoon.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“So they wouldn’t have much,” I observed, “even if they—”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Ah! But _he_ would have much,” said Wemmick, cutting me short, “and","Great Expectations"
"they know it. He’d have their lives, and the lives of scores of ’em.","Great Expectations"
"He’d have all he could get. And it’s impossible to say what he couldn’t","Great Expectations"
"get, if he gave his mind to it.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I was falling into meditation on my guardian’s greatness, when Wemmick","Great Expectations"
"remarked:—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“As to the absence of plate, that’s only his natural depth, you know. A","Great Expectations"
"river’s its natural depth, and he’s his natural depth. Look at his","Great Expectations"
"watch-chain. That’s real enough.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It’s very massive,” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Massive?” repeated Wemmick. “I think so. And his watch is a gold","Great Expectations"
"repeater, and worth a hundred pound if it’s worth a penny. Mr. Pip,","Great Expectations"
"there are about seven hundred thieves in this town who know all about","Great Expectations"
"that watch; there’s not a man, a woman, or a child, among them, who","Great Expectations"
"wouldn’t identify the smallest link in that chain, and drop it as if it","Great Expectations"
"was red hot, if inveigled into touching it.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"At first with such discourse, and afterwards with conversation of a","Great Expectations"
"more general nature, did Mr. Wemmick and I beguile the time and the","Great Expectations"
"road, until he gave me to understand that we had arrived in the","Great Expectations"
"district of Walworth.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It appeared to be a collection of back lanes, ditches, and little","Great Expectations"
"gardens, and to present the aspect of a rather dull retirement.","Great Expectations"
"Wemmick’s house was a little wooden cottage in the midst of plots of","Great Expectations"
"garden, and the top of it was cut out and painted like a battery","Great Expectations"
"mounted with guns.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“My own doing,” said Wemmick. “Looks pretty; don’t it?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I highly commended it, I think it was the smallest house I ever saw;","Great Expectations"
"with the queerest gothic windows (by far the greater part of them","Great Expectations"
"sham), and a gothic door almost too small to get in at.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“That’s a real flagstaff, you see,” said Wemmick, “and on Sundays I run","Great Expectations"
"up a real flag. Then look here. After I have crossed this bridge, I","Great Expectations"
"hoist it up—so—and cut off the communication.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The bridge was a plank, and it crossed a chasm about four feet wide and","Great Expectations"
"two deep. But it was very pleasant to see the pride with which he","Great Expectations"
"hoisted it up and made it fast; smiling as he did so, with a relish and","Great Expectations"
"not merely mechanically.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“At nine o’clock every night, Greenwich time,” said Wemmick, “the gun","Great Expectations"
"fires. There he is, you see! And when you hear him go, I think you’ll","Great Expectations"
"say he’s a Stinger.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The piece of ordnance referred to, was mounted in a separate fortress,","Great Expectations"
"constructed of lattice-work. It was protected from the weather by an","Great Expectations"
"ingenious little tarpaulin contrivance in the nature of an umbrella.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Then, at the back,” said Wemmick, “out of sight, so as not to impede","Great Expectations"
"the idea of fortifications,—for it’s a principle with me, if you have","Great Expectations"
"an idea, carry it out and keep it up,—I don’t know whether that’s your","Great Expectations"
"opinion—”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I said, decidedly.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“—At the back, there’s a pig, and there are fowls and rabbits; then, I","Great Expectations"
"knock together my own little frame, you see, and grow cucumbers; and","Great Expectations"
"you’ll judge at supper what sort of a salad I can raise. So, sir,” said","Great Expectations"
"Wemmick, smiling again, but seriously too, as he shook his head, “if","Great Expectations"
"you can suppose the little place besieged, it would hold out a devil of","Great Expectations"
"a time in point of provisions.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Then, he conducted me to a bower about a dozen yards off, but which was","Great Expectations"
"approached by such ingenious twists of path that it took quite a long","Great Expectations"
"time to get at; and in this retreat our glasses were already set forth.","Great Expectations"
"Our punch was cooling in an ornamental lake, on whose margin the bower","Great Expectations"
"was raised. This piece of water (with an island in the middle which","Great Expectations"
"might have been the salad for supper) was of a circular form, and he","Great Expectations"
"had constructed a fountain in it, which, when you set a little mill","Great Expectations"
"going and took a cork out of a pipe, played to that powerful extent","Great Expectations"
"that it made the back of your hand quite wet.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I am my own engineer, and my own carpenter, and my own plumber, and my","Great Expectations"
"own gardener, and my own Jack of all Trades,” said Wemmick, in","Great Expectations"
"acknowledging my compliments. “Well; it’s a good thing, you know. It","Great Expectations"
"brushes the Newgate cobwebs away, and pleases the Aged. You wouldn’t","Great Expectations"
"mind being at once introduced to the Aged, would you? It wouldn’t put","Great Expectations"
"you out?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I expressed the readiness I felt, and we went into the castle. There we","Great Expectations"
"found, sitting by a fire, a very old man in a flannel coat: clean,","Great Expectations"
"cheerful, comfortable, and well cared for, but intensely deaf.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well aged parent,” said Wemmick, shaking hands with him in a cordial","Great Expectations"
"and jocose way, “how am you?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“All right, John; all right!” replied the old man.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Here’s Mr. Pip, aged parent,” said Wemmick, “and I wish you could hear","Great Expectations"
"his name. Nod away at him, Mr. Pip; that’s what he likes. Nod away at","Great Expectations"
"him, if you please, like winking!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“This is a fine place of my son’s, sir,” cried the old man, while I","Great Expectations"
"nodded as hard as I possibly could. “This is a pretty pleasure-ground,","Great Expectations"
"sir. This spot and these beautiful works upon it ought to be kept","Great Expectations"
"together by the Nation, after my son’s time, for the people’s","Great Expectations"
"enjoyment.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You’re as proud of it as Punch; ain’t you, Aged?” said Wemmick,","Great Expectations"
"contemplating the old man, with his hard face really softened;","Great Expectations"
"“_there’s_ a nod for you;” giving him a tremendous one; “_there’s_","Great Expectations"
"another for you;” giving him a still more tremendous one; “you like","Great Expectations"
"that, don’t you? If you’re not tired, Mr. Pip—though I know it’s tiring","Great Expectations"
"to strangers—will you tip him one more? You can’t think how it pleases","Great Expectations"
"him.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I tipped him several more, and he was in great spirits. We left him","Great Expectations"
"bestirring himself to feed the fowls, and we sat down to our punch in","Great Expectations"
"the arbour; where Wemmick told me, as he smoked a pipe, that it had","Great Expectations"
"taken him a good many years to bring the property up to its present","Great Expectations"
"pitch of perfection.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Is it your own, Mr. Wemmick?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“O yes,” said Wemmick, “I have got hold of it, a bit at a time. It’s a","Great Expectations"
"freehold, by George!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Is it indeed? I hope Mr. Jaggers admires it?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Never seen it,” said Wemmick. “Never heard of it. Never seen the Aged.","Great Expectations"
"Never heard of him. No; the office is one thing, and private life is","Great Expectations"
"another. When I go into the office, I leave the Castle behind me, and","Great Expectations"
"when I come into the Castle, I leave the office behind me. If it’s not","Great Expectations"
"in any way disagreeable to you, you’ll oblige me by doing the same. I","Great Expectations"
"don’t wish it professionally spoken about.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Of course I felt my good faith involved in the observance of his","Great Expectations"
"request. The punch being very nice, we sat there drinking it and","Great Expectations"
"talking, until it was almost nine o’clock. “Getting near gun-fire,”","Great Expectations"
"said Wemmick then, as he laid down his pipe; “it’s the Aged’s treat.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Proceeding into the Castle again, we found the Aged heating the poker,","Great Expectations"
"with expectant eyes, as a preliminary to the performance of this great","Great Expectations"
"nightly ceremony. Wemmick stood with his watch in his hand until the","Great Expectations"
"moment was come for him to take the red-hot poker from the Aged, and","Great Expectations"
"repair to the battery. He took it, and went out, and presently the","Great Expectations"
"Stinger went off with a Bang that shook the crazy little box of a","Great Expectations"
"cottage as if it must fall to pieces, and made every glass and teacup","Great Expectations"
"in it ring. Upon this, the Aged—who I believe would have been blown out","Great Expectations"
"of his arm-chair but for holding on by the elbows—cried out exultingly,","Great Expectations"
"“He’s fired! I heerd him!” and I nodded at the old gentleman until it","Great Expectations"
"is no figure of speech to declare that I absolutely could not see him.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The interval between that time and supper Wemmick devoted to showing me","Great Expectations"
"his collection of curiosities. They were mostly of a felonious","Great Expectations"
"character; comprising the pen with which a celebrated forgery had been","Great Expectations"
"committed, a distinguished razor or two, some locks of hair, and","Great Expectations"
"several manuscript confessions written under condemnation,—upon which","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Wemmick set particular value as being, to use his own words, “every","Great Expectations"
"one of ’em Lies, sir.” These were agreeably dispersed among small","Great Expectations"
"specimens of china and glass, various neat trifles made by the","Great Expectations"
"proprietor of the museum, and some tobacco-stoppers carved by the Aged.","Great Expectations"
"They were all displayed in that chamber of the Castle into which I had","Great Expectations"
"been first inducted, and which served, not only as the general","Great Expectations"
"sitting-room but as the kitchen too, if I might judge from a saucepan","Great Expectations"
"on the hob, and a brazen bijou over the fireplace designed for the","Great Expectations"
"suspension of a roasting-jack.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"There was a neat little girl in attendance, who looked after the Aged","Great Expectations"
"in the day. When she had laid the supper-cloth, the bridge was lowered","Great Expectations"
"to give her means of egress, and she withdrew for the night. The supper","Great Expectations"
"was excellent; and though the Castle was rather subject to dry-rot","Great Expectations"
"insomuch that it tasted like a bad nut, and though the pig might have","Great Expectations"
"been farther off, I was heartily pleased with my whole entertainment.","Great Expectations"
"Nor was there any drawback on my little turret bedroom, beyond there","Great Expectations"
"being such a very thin ceiling between me and the flagstaff, that when","Great Expectations"
"I lay down on my back in bed, it seemed as if I had to balance that","Great Expectations"
"pole on my forehead all night.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Wemmick was up early in the morning, and I am afraid I heard him","Great Expectations"
"cleaning my boots. After that, he fell to gardening, and I saw him from","Great Expectations"
"my gothic window pretending to employ the Aged, and nodding at him in a","Great Expectations"
"most devoted manner. Our breakfast was as good as the supper, and at","Great Expectations"
"half-past eight precisely we started for Little Britain. By degrees,","Great Expectations"
"Wemmick got dryer and harder as we went along, and his mouth tightened","Great Expectations"
"into a post-office again. At last, when we got to his place of business","Great Expectations"
"and he pulled out his key from his coat-collar, he looked as","Great Expectations"
"unconscious of his Walworth property as if the Castle and the","Great Expectations"
"drawbridge and the arbour and the lake and the fountain and the Aged,","Great Expectations"
"had all been blown into space together by the last discharge of the","Great Expectations"
"Stinger.","Great Expectations"

"","Great Expectations"
"Chapter XXVI.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It fell out as Wemmick had told me it would, that I had an early","Great Expectations"
"opportunity of comparing my guardian’s establishment with that of his","Great Expectations"
"cashier and clerk. My guardian was in his room, washing his hands with","Great Expectations"
"his scented soap, when I went into the office from Walworth; and he","Great Expectations"
"called me to him, and gave me the invitation for myself and friends","Great Expectations"
"which Wemmick had prepared me to receive. “No ceremony,” he stipulated,","Great Expectations"
"“and no dinner dress, and say to-morrow.” I asked him where we should","Great Expectations"
"come to (for I had no idea where he lived), and I believe it was in his","Great Expectations"
"general objection to make anything like an admission, that he replied,","Great Expectations"
"“Come here, and I’ll take you home with me.” I embrace this opportunity","Great Expectations"
"of remarking that he washed his clients off, as if he were a surgeon or","Great Expectations"
"a dentist. He had a closet in his room, fitted up for the purpose,","Great Expectations"
"which smelt of the scented soap like a perfumer’s shop. It had an","Great Expectations"
"unusually large jack-towel on a roller inside the door, and he would","Great Expectations"
"wash his hands, and wipe them and dry them all over this towel,","Great Expectations"
"whenever he came in from a police court or dismissed a client from his","Great Expectations"
"room. When I and my friends repaired to him at six o’clock next day, he","Great Expectations"
"seemed to have been engaged on a case of a darker complexion than","Great Expectations"
"usual, for we found him with his head butted into this closet, not only","Great Expectations"
"washing his hands, but laving his face and gargling his throat. And","Great Expectations"
"even when he had done all that, and had gone all round the jack-towel,","Great Expectations"
"he took out his penknife and scraped the case out of his nails before","Great Expectations"
"he put his coat on.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"There were some people slinking about as usual when we passed out into","Great Expectations"
"the street, who were evidently anxious to speak with him; but there was","Great Expectations"
"something so conclusive in the halo of scented soap which encircled his","Great Expectations"
"presence, that they gave it up for that day. As we walked along","Great Expectations"
"westward, he was recognised ever and again by some face in the crowd of","Great Expectations"
"the streets, and whenever that happened he talked louder to me; but he","Great Expectations"
"never otherwise recognised anybody, or took notice that anybody","Great Expectations"
"recognised him.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He conducted us to Gerrard Street, Soho, to a house on the south side","Great Expectations"
"of that street. Rather a stately house of its kind, but dolefully in","Great Expectations"
"want of painting, and with dirty windows. He took out his key and","Great Expectations"
"opened the door, and we all went into a stone hall, bare, gloomy, and","Great Expectations"
"little used. So, up a dark brown staircase into a series of three dark","Great Expectations"
"brown rooms on the first floor. There were carved garlands on the","Great Expectations"
"panelled walls, and as he stood among them giving us welcome, I know","Great Expectations"
"what kind of loops I thought they looked like.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Dinner was laid in the best of these rooms; the second was his","Great Expectations"
"dressing-room; the third, his bedroom. He told us that he held the","Great Expectations"
"whole house, but rarely used more of it than we saw. The table was","Great Expectations"
"comfortably laid—no silver in the service, of course—and at the side of","Great Expectations"
"his chair was a capacious dumb-waiter, with a variety of bottles and","Great Expectations"
"decanters on it, and four dishes of fruit for dessert. I noticed","Great Expectations"
"throughout, that he kept everything under his own hand, and distributed","Great Expectations"
"everything himself.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"There was a bookcase in the room; I saw from the backs of the books,","Great Expectations"
"that they were about evidence, criminal law, criminal biography,","Great Expectations"
"trials, acts of Parliament, and such things. The furniture was all very","Great Expectations"
"solid and good, like his watch-chain. It had an official look, however,","Great Expectations"
"and there was nothing merely ornamental to be seen. In a corner was a","Great Expectations"
"little table of papers with a shaded lamp: so that he seemed to bring","Great Expectations"
"the office home with him in that respect too, and to wheel it out of an","Great Expectations"
"evening and fall to work.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As he had scarcely seen my three companions until now,—for he and I had","Great Expectations"
"walked together,—he stood on the hearth-rug, after ringing the bell,","Great Expectations"
"and took a searching look at them. To my surprise, he seemed at once to","Great Expectations"
"be principally if not solely interested in Drummle.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Pip,” said he, putting his large hand on my shoulder and moving me to","Great Expectations"
"the window, “I don’t know one from the other. Who’s the Spider?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“The spider?” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“The blotchy, sprawly, sulky fellow.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“That’s Bentley Drummle,” I replied; “the one with the delicate face is","Great Expectations"
"Startop.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Not making the least account of “the one with the delicate face,” he","Great Expectations"
"returned, “Bentley Drummle is his name, is it? I like the look of that","Great Expectations"
"fellow.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He immediately began to talk to Drummle: not at all deterred by his","Great Expectations"
"replying in his heavy reticent way, but apparently led on by it to","Great Expectations"
"screw discourse out of him. I was looking at the two, when there came","Great Expectations"
"between me and them the housekeeper, with the first dish for the table.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"She was a woman of about forty, I supposed,—but I may have thought her","Great Expectations"
"younger than she was. Rather tall, of a lithe nimble figure, extremely","Great Expectations"
"pale, with large faded eyes, and a quantity of streaming hair. I cannot","Great Expectations"
"say whether any diseased affection of the heart caused her lips to be","Great Expectations"
"parted as if she were panting, and her face to bear a curious","Great Expectations"
"expression of suddenness and flutter; but I know that I had been to see","Great Expectations"
"Macbeth at the theatre, a night or two before, and that her face looked","Great Expectations"
"to me as if it were all disturbed by fiery air, like the faces I had","Great Expectations"
"seen rise out of the Witches’ caldron.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"She set the dish on, touched my guardian quietly on the arm with a","Great Expectations"
"finger to notify that dinner was ready, and vanished. We took our seats","Great Expectations"
"at the round table, and my guardian kept Drummle on one side of him,","Great Expectations"
"while Startop sat on the other. It was a noble dish of fish that the","Great Expectations"
"housekeeper had put on table, and we had a joint of equally choice","Great Expectations"
"mutton afterwards, and then an equally choice bird. Sauces, wines, all","Great Expectations"
"the accessories we wanted, and all of the best, were given out by our","Great Expectations"
"host from his dumb-waiter; and when they had made the circuit of the","Great Expectations"
"table, he always put them back again. Similarly, he dealt us clean","Great Expectations"
"plates and knives and forks, for each course, and dropped those just","Great Expectations"
"disused into two baskets on the ground by his chair. No other attendant","Great Expectations"
"than the housekeeper appeared. She set on every dish; and I always saw","Great Expectations"
"in her face, a face rising out of the caldron. Years afterwards, I made","Great Expectations"
"a dreadful likeness of that woman, by causing a face that had no other","Great Expectations"
"natural resemblance to it than it derived from flowing hair to pass","Great Expectations"
"behind a bowl of flaming spirits in a dark room.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Induced to take particular notice of the housekeeper, both by her own","Great Expectations"
"striking appearance and by Wemmick’s preparation, I observed that","Great Expectations"
"whenever she was in the room she kept her eyes attentively on my","Great Expectations"
"guardian, and that she would remove her hands from any dish she put","Great Expectations"
"before him, hesitatingly, as if she dreaded his calling her back, and","Great Expectations"
"wanted him to speak when she was nigh, if he had anything to say. I","Great Expectations"
"fancied that I could detect in his manner a consciousness of this, and","Great Expectations"
"a purpose of always holding her in suspense.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Dinner went off gayly, and although my guardian seemed to follow rather","Great Expectations"
"than originate subjects, I knew that he wrenched the weakest part of","Great Expectations"
"our dispositions out of us. For myself, I found that I was expressing","Great Expectations"
"my tendency to lavish expenditure, and to patronise Herbert, and to","Great Expectations"
"boast of my great prospects, before I quite knew that I had opened my","Great Expectations"
"lips. It was so with all of us, but with no one more than Drummle: the","Great Expectations"
"development of whose inclination to gird in a grudging and suspicious","Great Expectations"
"way at the rest, was screwed out of him before the fish was taken off.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was not then, but when we had got to the cheese, that our","Great Expectations"
"conversation turned upon our rowing feats, and that Drummle was rallied","Great Expectations"
"for coming up behind of a night in that slow amphibious way of his.","Great Expectations"
"Drummle upon this, informed our host that he much preferred our room to","Great Expectations"
"our company, and that as to skill he was more than our master, and that","Great Expectations"
"as to strength he could scatter us like chaff. By some invisible","Great Expectations"
"agency, my guardian wound him up to a pitch little short of ferocity","Great Expectations"
"about this trifle; and he fell to baring and spanning his arm to show","Great Expectations"
"how muscular it was, and we all fell to baring and spanning our arms in","Great Expectations"
"a ridiculous manner.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Now the housekeeper was at that time clearing the table; my guardian,","Great Expectations"
"taking no heed of her, but with the side of his face turned from her,","Great Expectations"
"was leaning back in his chair biting the side of his forefinger and","Great Expectations"
"showing an interest in Drummle, that, to me, was quite inexplicable.","Great Expectations"
"Suddenly, he clapped his large hand on the housekeeper’s, like a trap,","Great Expectations"
"as she stretched it across the table. So suddenly and smartly did he do","Great Expectations"
"this, that we all stopped in our foolish contention.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“If you talk of strength,” said Mr. Jaggers, “_I_’ll show you a wrist.","Great Expectations"
"Molly, let them see your wrist.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Her entrapped hand was on the table, but she had already put her other","Great Expectations"
"hand behind her waist. “Master,” she said, in a low voice, with her","Great Expectations"
"eyes attentively and entreatingly fixed upon him. “Don’t.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“_I_’ll show you a wrist,” repeated Mr. Jaggers, with an immovable","Great Expectations"
"determination to show it. “Molly, let them see your wrist.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Master,” she again murmured. “Please!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Molly,” said Mr. Jaggers, not looking at her, but obstinately looking","Great Expectations"
"at the opposite side of the room, “let them see _both_ your wrists.","Great Expectations"
"Show them. Come!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He took his hand from hers, and turned that wrist up on the table. She","Great Expectations"
"brought her other hand from behind her, and held the two out side by","Great Expectations"
"side. The last wrist was much disfigured,—deeply scarred and scarred","Great Expectations"
"across and across. When she held her hands out she took her eyes from","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Jaggers, and turned them watchfully on every one of the rest of us","Great Expectations"
"in succession.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“There’s power here,” said Mr. Jaggers, coolly tracing out the sinews","Great Expectations"
"with his forefinger. “Very few men have the power of wrist that this","Great Expectations"
"woman has. It’s remarkable what mere force of grip there is in these","Great Expectations"
"hands. I have had occasion to notice many hands; but I never saw","Great Expectations"
"stronger in that respect, man’s or woman’s, than these.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"While he said these words in a leisurely, critical style, she continued","Great Expectations"
"to look at every one of us in regular succession as we sat. The moment","Great Expectations"
"he ceased, she looked at him again. “That’ll do, Molly,” said Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Jaggers, giving her a slight nod; “you have been admired, and can go.”","Great Expectations"
"She withdrew her hands and went out of the room, and Mr. Jaggers,","Great Expectations"
"putting the decanters on from his dumb-waiter, filled his glass and","Great Expectations"
"passed round the wine.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“At half-past nine, gentlemen,” said he, “we must break up. Pray make","Great Expectations"
"the best use of your time. I am glad to see you all. Mr. Drummle, I","Great Expectations"
"drink to you.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"If his object in singling out Drummle were to bring him out still more,","Great Expectations"
"it perfectly succeeded. In a sulky triumph, Drummle showed his morose","Great Expectations"
"depreciation of the rest of us, in a more and more offensive degree,","Great Expectations"
"until he became downright intolerable. Through all his stages, Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Jaggers followed him with the same strange interest. He actually seemed","Great Expectations"
"to serve as a zest to Mr. Jaggers’s wine.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"In our boyish want of discretion I dare say we took too much to drink,","Great Expectations"
"and I know we talked too much. We became particularly hot upon some","Great Expectations"
"boorish sneer of Drummle’s, to the effect that we were too free with","Great Expectations"
"our money. It led to my remarking, with more zeal than discretion, that","Great Expectations"
"it came with a bad grace from him, to whom Startop had lent money in my","Great Expectations"
"presence but a week or so before.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well,” retorted Drummle; “he’ll be paid.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I don’t mean to imply that he won’t,” said I, “but it might make you","Great Expectations"
"hold your tongue about us and our money, I should think.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“_You_ should think!” retorted Drummle. “Oh Lord!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I dare say,” I went on, meaning to be very severe, “that you wouldn’t","Great Expectations"
"lend money to any of us if we wanted it.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You are right,” said Drummle. “I wouldn’t lend one of you a sixpence.","Great Expectations"
"I wouldn’t lend anybody a sixpence.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Rather mean to borrow under those circumstances, I should say.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“_You_ should say,” repeated Drummle. “Oh Lord!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"This was so very aggravating—the more especially as I found myself","Great Expectations"
"making no way against his surly obtuseness—that I said, disregarding","Great Expectations"
"Herbert’s efforts to check me,—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Come, Mr. Drummle, since we are on the subject, I’ll tell you what","Great Expectations"
"passed between Herbert here and me, when you borrowed that money.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“_I_ don’t want to know what passed between Herbert there and you,”","Great Expectations"
"growled Drummle. And I think he added in a lower growl, that we might","Great Expectations"
"both go to the devil and shake ourselves.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I’ll tell you, however,” said I, “whether you want to know or not. We","Great Expectations"
"said that as you put it in your pocket very glad to get it, you seemed","Great Expectations"
"to be immensely amused at his being so weak as to lend it.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Drummle laughed outright, and sat laughing in our faces, with his hands","Great Expectations"
"in his pockets and his round shoulders raised; plainly signifying that","Great Expectations"
"it was quite true, and that he despised us as asses all.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Hereupon Startop took him in hand, though with a much better grace than","Great Expectations"
"I had shown, and exhorted him to be a little more agreeable. Startop,","Great Expectations"
"being a lively, bright young fellow, and Drummle being the exact","Great Expectations"
"opposite, the latter was always disposed to resent him as a direct","Great Expectations"
"personal affront. He now retorted in a coarse, lumpish way, and Startop","Great Expectations"
"tried to turn the discussion aside with some small pleasantry that made","Great Expectations"
"us all laugh. Resenting this little success more than anything,","Great Expectations"
"Drummle, without any threat or warning, pulled his hands out of his","Great Expectations"
"pockets, dropped his round shoulders, swore, took up a large glass, and","Great Expectations"
"would have flung it at his adversary’s head, but for our entertainer’s","Great Expectations"
"dexterously seizing it at the instant when it was raised for that","Great Expectations"
"purpose.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Gentlemen,” said Mr. Jaggers, deliberately putting down the glass, and","Great Expectations"
"hauling out his gold repeater by its massive chain, “I am exceedingly","Great Expectations"
"sorry to announce that it’s half past nine.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"On this hint we all rose to depart. Before we got to the street door,","Great Expectations"
"Startop was cheerily calling Drummle “old boy,” as if nothing had","Great Expectations"
"happened. But the old boy was so far from responding, that he would not","Great Expectations"
"even walk to Hammersmith on the same side of the way; so Herbert and I,","Great Expectations"
"who remained in town, saw them going down the street on opposite sides;","Great Expectations"
"Startop leading, and Drummle lagging behind in the shadow of the","Great Expectations"
"houses, much as he was wont to follow in his boat.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As the door was not yet shut, I thought I would leave Herbert there for","Great Expectations"
"a moment, and run upstairs again to say a word to my guardian. I found","Great Expectations"
"him in his dressing-room surrounded by his stock of boots, already hard","Great Expectations"
"at it, washing his hands of us.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I told him I had come up again to say how sorry I was that anything","Great Expectations"
"disagreeable should have occurred, and that I hoped he would not blame","Great Expectations"
"me much.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Pooh!” said he, sluicing his face, and speaking through the","Great Expectations"
"water-drops; “it’s nothing, Pip. I like that Spider though.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He had turned towards me now, and was shaking his head, and blowing,","Great Expectations"
"and towelling himself.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I am glad you like him, sir,” said I—“but I don’t.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No, no,” my guardian assented; “don’t have too much to do with him.","Great Expectations"
"Keep as clear of him as you can. But I like the fellow, Pip; he is one","Great Expectations"
"of the true sort. Why, if I was a fortune-teller—”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Looking out of the towel, he caught my eye.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“But I am not a fortune-teller,” he said, letting his head drop into a","Great Expectations"
"festoon of towel, and towelling away at his two ears. “You know what I","Great Expectations"
"am, don’t you? Good night, Pip.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Good night, sir.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"In about a month after that, the Spider’s time with Mr. Pocket was up","Great Expectations"
"for good, and, to the great relief of all the house but Mrs. Pocket, he","Great Expectations"
"went home to the family hole.","Great Expectations"

"Chapter XXVII.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“MY DEAR MR PIP:—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I write this by request of Mr. Gargery, for to let you know that he is","Great Expectations"
"going to London in company with Mr. Wopsle and would be glad if","Great Expectations"
"agreeable to be allowed to see you. He would call at Barnard’s Hotel","Great Expectations"
"Tuesday morning at nine o’clock, when if not agreeable please leave","Great Expectations"
"word. Your poor sister is much the same as when you left. We talk of","Great Expectations"
"you in the kitchen every night, and wonder what you are saying and","Great Expectations"
"doing. If now considered in the light of a liberty, excuse it for the","Great Expectations"
"love of poor old days. No more, dear Mr. Pip, from","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Your ever obliged, and affectionate servant,","Great Expectations"
"“BIDDY.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“P.S. He wishes me most particular to write _what larks_. He says you","Great Expectations"
"will understand. I hope and do not doubt it will be agreeable to see","Great Expectations"
"him, even though a gentleman, for you had ever a good heart, and he is","Great Expectations"
"a worthy, worthy man. I have read him all, excepting only the last","Great Expectations"
"little sentence, and he wishes me most particular to write again _what","Great Expectations"
"larks_.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I received this letter by the post on Monday morning, and therefore its","Great Expectations"
"appointment was for next day. Let me confess exactly with what feelings","Great Expectations"
"I looked forward to Joe’s coming.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Not with pleasure, though I was bound to him by so many ties; no; with","Great Expectations"
"considerable disturbance, some mortification, and a keen sense of","Great Expectations"
"incongruity. If I could have kept him away by paying money, I certainly","Great Expectations"
"would have paid money. My greatest reassurance was that he was coming","Great Expectations"
"to Barnard’s Inn, not to Hammersmith, and consequently would not fall","Great Expectations"
"in Bentley Drummle’s way. I had little objection to his being seen by","Great Expectations"
"Herbert or his father, for both of whom I had a respect; but I had the","Great Expectations"
"sharpest sensitiveness as to his being seen by Drummle, whom I held in","Great Expectations"
"contempt. So, throughout life, our worst weaknesses and meannesses are","Great Expectations"
"usually committed for the sake of the people whom we most despise.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I had begun to be always decorating the chambers in some quite","Great Expectations"
"unnecessary and inappropriate way or other, and very expensive those","Great Expectations"
"wrestles with Barnard proved to be. By this time, the rooms were vastly","Great Expectations"
"different from what I had found them, and I enjoyed the honour of","Great Expectations"
"occupying a few prominent pages in the books of a neighbouring","Great Expectations"
"upholsterer. I had got on so fast of late, that I had even started a","Great Expectations"
"boy in boots,—top boots,—in bondage and slavery to whom I might have","Great Expectations"
"been said to pass my days. For, after I had made the monster (out of","Great Expectations"
"the refuse of my washerwoman’s family), and had clothed him with a blue","Great Expectations"
"coat, canary waistcoat, white cravat, creamy breeches, and the boots","Great Expectations"
"already mentioned, I had to find him a little to do and a great deal to","Great Expectations"
"eat; and with both of those horrible requirements he haunted my","Great Expectations"
"existence.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"This avenging phantom was ordered to be on duty at eight on Tuesday","Great Expectations"
"morning in the hall, (it was two feet square, as charged for","Great Expectations"
"floorcloth,) and Herbert suggested certain things for breakfast that he","Great Expectations"
"thought Joe would like. While I felt sincerely obliged to him for being","Great Expectations"
"so interested and considerate, I had an odd half-provoked sense of","Great Expectations"
"suspicion upon me, that if Joe had been coming to see _him_, he","Great Expectations"
"wouldn’t have been quite so brisk about it.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"However, I came into town on the Monday night to be ready for Joe, and","Great Expectations"
"I got up early in the morning, and caused the sitting-room and","Great Expectations"
"breakfast-table to assume their most splendid appearance. Unfortunately","Great Expectations"
"the morning was drizzly, and an angel could not have concealed the fact","Great Expectations"
"that Barnard was shedding sooty tears outside the window, like some","Great Expectations"
"weak giant of a Sweep.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As the time approached I should have liked to run away, but the Avenger","Great Expectations"
"pursuant to orders was in the hall, and presently I heard Joe on the","Great Expectations"
"staircase. I knew it was Joe, by his clumsy manner of coming","Great Expectations"
"upstairs,—his state boots being always too big for him,—and by the time","Great Expectations"
"it took him to read the names on the other floors in the course of his","Great Expectations"
"ascent. When at last he stopped outside our door, I could hear his","Great Expectations"
"finger tracing over the painted letters of my name, and I afterwards","Great Expectations"
"distinctly heard him breathing in at the keyhole. Finally he gave a","Great Expectations"
"faint single rap, and Pepper—such was the compromising name of the","Great Expectations"
"avenging boy—announced “Mr. Gargery!” I thought he never would have","Great Expectations"
"done wiping his feet, and that I must have gone out to lift him off the","Great Expectations"
"mat, but at last he came in.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Joe, how are you, Joe?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Pip, how AIR you, Pip?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"With his good honest face all glowing and shining, and his hat put down","Great Expectations"
"on the floor between us, he caught both my hands and worked them","Great Expectations"
"straight up and down, as if I had been the last-patented Pump.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I am glad to see you, Joe. Give me your hat.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"But Joe, taking it up carefully with both hands, like a bird’s-nest","Great Expectations"
"with eggs in it, wouldn’t hear of parting with that piece of property,","Great Expectations"
"and persisted in standing talking over it in a most uncomfortable way.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Which you have that growed,” said Joe, “and that swelled, and that","Great Expectations"
"gentle-folked;” Joe considered a little before he discovered this word;","Great Expectations"
"“as to be sure you are a honour to your king and country.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And you, Joe, look wonderfully well.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Thank God,” said Joe, “I’m ekerval to most. And your sister, she’s no","Great Expectations"
"worse than she were. And Biddy, she’s ever right and ready. And all","Great Expectations"
"friends is no backerder, if not no forarder. ’Ceptin Wopsle; he’s had a","Great Expectations"
"drop.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"All this time (still with both hands taking great care of the","Great Expectations"
"bird’s-nest), Joe was rolling his eyes round and round the room, and","Great Expectations"
"round and round the flowered pattern of my dressing-gown.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Had a drop, Joe?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Why yes,” said Joe, lowering his voice, “he’s left the Church and went","Great Expectations"
"into the playacting. Which the playacting have likeways brought him to","Great Expectations"
"London along with me. And his wish were,” said Joe, getting the","Great Expectations"
"bird’s-nest under his left arm for the moment, and groping in it for an","Great Expectations"
"egg with his right; “if no offence, as I would ’and you that.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I took what Joe gave me, and found it to be the crumpled play-bill of a","Great Expectations"
"small metropolitan theatre, announcing the first appearance, in that","Great Expectations"
"very week, of “the celebrated Provincial Amateur of Roscian renown,","Great Expectations"
"whose unique performance in the highest tragic walk of our National","Great Expectations"
"Bard has lately occasioned so great a sensation in local dramatic","Great Expectations"
"circles.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Were you at his performance, Joe?” I inquired.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I _were_,” said Joe, with emphasis and solemnity.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Was there a great sensation?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Why,” said Joe, “yes, there certainly were a peck of orange-peel.","Great Expectations"
"Partickler when he see the ghost. Though I put it to yourself, sir,","Great Expectations"
"whether it were calc’lated to keep a man up to his work with a good","Great Expectations"
"hart, to be continiwally cutting in betwixt him and the Ghost with","Great Expectations"
"“Amen!” A man may have had a misfortun’ and been in the Church,” said","Great Expectations"
"Joe, lowering his voice to an argumentative and feeling tone, “but that","Great Expectations"
"is no reason why you should put him out at such a time. Which I","Great Expectations"
"meantersay, if the ghost of a man’s own father cannot be allowed to","Great Expectations"
"claim his attention, what can, Sir? Still more, when his mourning ’at","Great Expectations"
"is unfortunately made so small as that the weight of the black feathers","Great Expectations"
"brings it off, try to keep it on how you may.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"A ghost-seeing effect in Joe’s own countenance informed me that Herbert","Great Expectations"
"had entered the room. So, I presented Joe to Herbert, who held out his","Great Expectations"
"hand; but Joe backed from it, and held on by the bird’s-nest.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Your servant, Sir,” said Joe, “which I hope as you and Pip”—here his","Great Expectations"
"eye fell on the Avenger, who was putting some toast on table, and so","Great Expectations"
"plainly denoted an intention to make that young gentleman one of the","Great Expectations"
"family, that I frowned it down and confused him more—“I meantersay, you","Great Expectations"
"two gentlemen,—which I hope as you get your elths in this close spot?","Great Expectations"
"For the present may be a werry good inn, according to London opinions,”","Great Expectations"
"said Joe, confidentially, “and I believe its character do stand it; but","Great Expectations"
"I wouldn’t keep a pig in it myself,—not in the case that I wished him","Great Expectations"
"to fatten wholesome and to eat with a meller flavour on him.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Having borne this flattering testimony to the merits of our","Great Expectations"
"dwelling-place, and having incidentally shown this tendency to call me","Great Expectations"
"“sir,” Joe, being invited to sit down to table, looked all round the","Great Expectations"
"room for a suitable spot on which to deposit his hat,—as if it were","Great Expectations"
"only on some very few rare substances in nature that it could find a","Great Expectations"
"resting place,—and ultimately stood it on an extreme corner of the","Great Expectations"
"chimney-piece, from which it ever afterwards fell off at intervals.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Do you take tea, or coffee, Mr. Gargery?” asked Herbert, who always","Great Expectations"
"presided of a morning.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Thankee, Sir,” said Joe, stiff from head to foot, “I’ll take whichever","Great Expectations"
"is most agreeable to yourself.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What do you say to coffee?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Thankee, Sir,” returned Joe, evidently dispirited by the proposal,","Great Expectations"
"“since you _are_ so kind as make chice of coffee, I will not run","Great Expectations"
"contrairy to your own opinions. But don’t you never find it a little","Great Expectations"
"’eating?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Say tea then,” said Herbert, pouring it out.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Here Joe’s hat tumbled off the mantel-piece, and he started out of his","Great Expectations"
"chair and picked it up, and fitted it to the same exact spot. As if it","Great Expectations"
"were an absolute point of good breeding that it should tumble off again","Great Expectations"
"soon.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“When did you come to town, Mr. Gargery?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Were it yesterday afternoon?” said Joe, after coughing behind his","Great Expectations"
"hand, as if he had had time to catch the whooping-cough since he came.","Great Expectations"
"“No it were not. Yes it were. Yes. It were yesterday afternoon” (with","Great Expectations"
"an appearance of mingled wisdom, relief, and strict impartiality).","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Have you seen anything of London yet?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Why, yes, Sir,” said Joe, “me and Wopsle went off straight to look at","Great Expectations"
"the Blacking Ware’us. But we didn’t find that it come up to its","Great Expectations"
"likeness in the red bills at the shop doors; which I meantersay,” added","Great Expectations"
"Joe, in an explanatory manner, “as it is there drawd too","Great Expectations"
"architectooralooral.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I really believe Joe would have prolonged this word (mightily","Great Expectations"
"expressive to my mind of some architecture that I know) into a perfect","Great Expectations"
"Chorus, but for his attention being providentially attracted by his","Great Expectations"
"hat, which was toppling. Indeed, it demanded from him a constant","Great Expectations"
"attention, and a quickness of eye and hand, very like that exacted by","Great Expectations"
"wicket-keeping. He made extraordinary play with it, and showed the","Great Expectations"
"greatest skill; now, rushing at it and catching it neatly as it","Great Expectations"
"dropped; now, merely stopping it midway, beating it up, and humouring","Great Expectations"
"it in various parts of the room and against a good deal of the pattern","Great Expectations"
"of the paper on the wall, before he felt it safe to close with it;","Great Expectations"
"finally splashing it into the slop-basin, where I took the liberty of","Great Expectations"
"laying hands upon it.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"[Illustration]","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As to his shirt-collar, and his coat-collar, they were perplexing to","Great Expectations"
"reflect upon,—insoluble mysteries both. Why should a man scrape himself","Great Expectations"
"to that extent, before he could consider himself full dressed? Why","Great Expectations"
"should he suppose it necessary to be purified by suffering for his","Great Expectations"
"holiday clothes? Then he fell into such unaccountable fits of","Great Expectations"
"meditation, with his fork midway between his plate and his mouth; had","Great Expectations"
"his eyes attracted in such strange directions; was afflicted with such","Great Expectations"
"remarkable coughs; sat so far from the table, and dropped so much more","Great Expectations"
"than he ate, and pretended that he hadn’t dropped it; that I was","Great Expectations"
"heartily glad when Herbert left us for the City.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I had neither the good sense nor the good feeling to know that this was","Great Expectations"
"all my fault, and that if I had been easier with Joe, Joe would have","Great Expectations"
"been easier with me. I felt impatient of him and out of temper with","Great Expectations"
"him; in which condition he heaped coals of fire on my head.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Us two being now alone, sir,”—began Joe.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Joe,” I interrupted, pettishly, “how can you call me, sir?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Joe looked at me for a single instant with something faintly like","Great Expectations"
"reproach. Utterly preposterous as his cravat was, and as his collars","Great Expectations"
"were, I was conscious of a sort of dignity in the look.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Us two being now alone,” resumed Joe, “and me having the intentions","Great Expectations"
"and abilities to stay not many minutes more, I will now","Great Expectations"
"conclude—leastways begin—to mention what have led to my having had the","Great Expectations"
"present honour. For was it not,” said Joe, with his old air of lucid","Great Expectations"
"exposition, “that my only wish were to be useful to you, I should not","Great Expectations"
"have had the honour of breaking wittles in the company and abode of","Great Expectations"
"gentlemen.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I was so unwilling to see the look again, that I made no remonstrance","Great Expectations"
"against this tone.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well, sir,” pursued Joe, “this is how it were. I were at the Bargemen","Great Expectations"
"t’other night, Pip;”—whenever he subsided into affection, he called me","Great Expectations"
"Pip, and whenever he relapsed into politeness he called me sir; “when","Great Expectations"
"there come up in his shay-cart, Pumblechook. Which that same","Great Expectations"
"identical,” said Joe, going down a new track, “do comb my ’air the","Great Expectations"
"wrong way sometimes, awful, by giving out up and down town as it were","Great Expectations"
"him which ever had your infant companionation and were looked upon as a","Great Expectations"
"playfellow by yourself.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Nonsense. It was you, Joe.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Which I fully believed it were, Pip,” said Joe, slightly tossing his","Great Expectations"
"head, “though it signify little now, sir. Well, Pip; this same","Great Expectations"
"identical, which his manners is given to blusterous, come to me at the","Great Expectations"
"Bargemen (wot a pipe and a pint of beer do give refreshment to the","Great Expectations"
"workingman, sir, and do not over stimilate), and his word were,","Great Expectations"
"‘Joseph, Miss Havisham she wish to speak to you.’”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Miss Havisham, Joe?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“‘She wish,’ were Pumblechook’s word, ‘to speak to you.’” Joe sat and","Great Expectations"
"rolled his eyes at the ceiling.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, Joe? Go on, please.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Next day, sir,” said Joe, looking at me as if I were a long way off,","Great Expectations"
"“having cleaned myself, I go and I see Miss A.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Miss A., Joe? Miss Havisham?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Which I say, sir,” replied Joe, with an air of legal formality, as if","Great Expectations"
"he were making his will, “Miss A., or otherways Havisham. Her","Great Expectations"
"expression air then as follering: ‘Mr. Gargery. You air in","Great Expectations"
"correspondence with Mr. Pip?’ Having had a letter from you, I were able","Great Expectations"
"to say ‘I am.’ (When I married your sister, sir, I said ‘I will;’ and","Great Expectations"
"when I answered your friend, Pip, I said ‘I am.’) ‘Would you tell him,","Great Expectations"
"then,’ said she, ‘that which Estella has come home and would be glad to","Great Expectations"
"see him.’”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I felt my face fire up as I looked at Joe. I hope one remote cause of","Great Expectations"
"its firing may have been my consciousness that if I had known his","Great Expectations"
"errand, I should have given him more encouragement.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Biddy,” pursued Joe, “when I got home and asked her fur to write the","Great Expectations"
"message to you, a little hung back. Biddy says, ‘I know he will be very","Great Expectations"
"glad to have it by word of mouth, it is holiday time, you want to see","Great Expectations"
"him, go!’ I have now concluded, sir,” said Joe, rising from his chair,","Great Expectations"
"“and, Pip, I wish you ever well and ever prospering to a greater and a","Great Expectations"
"greater height.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“But you are not going now, Joe?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes I am,” said Joe.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“But you are coming back to dinner, Joe?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No I am not,” said Joe.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Our eyes met, and all the “Sir” melted out of that manly heart as he","Great Expectations"
"gave me his hand.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Pip, dear old chap, life is made of ever so many partings welded","Great Expectations"
"together, as I may say, and one man’s a blacksmith, and one’s a","Great Expectations"
"whitesmith, and one’s a goldsmith, and one’s a coppersmith. Diwisions","Great Expectations"
"among such must come, and must be met as they come. If there’s been any","Great Expectations"
"fault at all to-day, it’s mine. You and me is not two figures to be","Great Expectations"
"together in London; nor yet anywheres else but what is private, and","Great Expectations"
"beknown, and understood among friends. It ain’t that I am proud, but","Great Expectations"
"that I want to be right, as you shall never see me no more in these","Great Expectations"
"clothes. I’m wrong in these clothes. I’m wrong out of the forge, the","Great Expectations"
"kitchen, or off th’ meshes. You won’t find half so much fault in me if","Great Expectations"
"you think of me in my forge dress, with my hammer in my hand, or even","Great Expectations"
"my pipe. You won’t find half so much fault in me if, supposing as you","Great Expectations"
"should ever wish to see me, you come and put your head in at the forge","Great Expectations"
"window and see Joe the blacksmith, there, at the old anvil, in the old","Great Expectations"
"burnt apron, sticking to the old work. I’m awful dull, but I hope I’ve","Great Expectations"
"beat out something nigh the rights of this at last. And so GOD bless","Great Expectations"
"you, dear old Pip, old chap, GOD bless you!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I had not been mistaken in my fancy that there was a simple dignity in","Great Expectations"
"him. The fashion of his dress could no more come in its way when he","Great Expectations"
"spoke these words than it could come in its way in Heaven. He touched","Great Expectations"
"me gently on the forehead, and went out. As soon as I could recover","Great Expectations"
"myself sufficiently, I hurried out after him and looked for him in the","Great Expectations"
"neighbouring streets; but he was gone.","Great Expectations"

"","Great Expectations"
"Chapter XXVIII.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was clear that I must repair to our town next day, and in the first","Great Expectations"
"flow of my repentance, it was equally clear that I must stay at Joe’s.","Great Expectations"
"But, when I had secured my box-place by to-morrow’s coach, and had been","Great Expectations"
"down to Mr. Pocket’s and back, I was not by any means convinced on the","Great Expectations"
"last point, and began to invent reasons and make excuses for putting up","Great Expectations"
"at the Blue Boar. I should be an inconvenience at Joe’s; I was not","Great Expectations"
"expected, and my bed would not be ready; I should be too far from Miss","Great Expectations"
"Havisham’s, and she was exacting and mightn’t like it. All other","Great Expectations"
"swindlers upon earth are nothing to the self-swindlers, and with such","Great Expectations"
"pretences did I cheat myself. Surely a curious thing. That I should","Great Expectations"
"innocently take a bad half-crown of somebody else’s manufacture is","Great Expectations"
"reasonable enough; but that I should knowingly reckon the spurious coin","Great Expectations"
"of my own make as good money! An obliging stranger, under pretence of","Great Expectations"
"compactly folding up my bank-notes for security’s sake, abstracts the","Great Expectations"
"notes and gives me nutshells; but what is his sleight of hand to mine,","Great Expectations"
"when I fold up my own nutshells and pass them on myself as notes!","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Having settled that I must go to the Blue Boar, my mind was much","Great Expectations"
"disturbed by indecision whether or not to take the Avenger. It was","Great Expectations"
"tempting to think of that expensive Mercenary publicly airing his boots","Great Expectations"
"in the archway of the Blue Boar’s posting-yard; it was almost solemn to","Great Expectations"
"imagine him casually produced in the tailor’s shop, and confounding the","Great Expectations"
"disrespectful senses of Trabb’s boy. On the other hand, Trabb’s boy","Great Expectations"
"might worm himself into his intimacy and tell him things; or, reckless","Great Expectations"
"and desperate wretch as I knew he could be, might hoot him in the High","Great Expectations"
"Street. My patroness, too, might hear of him, and not approve. On the","Great Expectations"
"whole, I resolved to leave the Avenger behind.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was the afternoon coach by which I had taken my place, and, as","Great Expectations"
"winter had now come round, I should not arrive at my destination until","Great Expectations"
"two or three hours after dark. Our time of starting from the Cross Keys","Great Expectations"
"was two o’clock. I arrived on the ground with a quarter of an hour to","Great Expectations"
"spare, attended by the Avenger,—if I may connect that expression with","Great Expectations"
"one who never attended on me if he could possibly help it.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"At that time it was customary to carry Convicts down to the dock-yards","Great Expectations"
"by stage-coach. As I had often heard of them in the capacity of outside","Great Expectations"
"passengers, and had more than once seen them on the high road dangling","Great Expectations"
"their ironed legs over the coach roof, I had no cause to be surprised","Great Expectations"
"when Herbert, meeting me in the yard, came up and told me there were","Great Expectations"
"two convicts going down with me. But I had a reason that was an old","Great Expectations"
"reason now for constitutionally faltering whenever I heard the word","Great Expectations"
"“convict.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You don’t mind them, Handel?” said Herbert.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“O no!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I thought you seemed as if you didn’t like them?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I can’t pretend that I do like them, and I suppose you don’t","Great Expectations"
"particularly. But I don’t mind them.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“See! There they are,” said Herbert, “coming out of the Tap. What a","Great Expectations"
"degraded and vile sight it is!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"They had been treating their guard, I suppose, for they had a gaoler","Great Expectations"
"with them, and all three came out wiping their mouths on their hands.","Great Expectations"
"The two convicts were handcuffed together, and had irons on their","Great Expectations"
"legs,—irons of a pattern that I knew well. They wore the dress that I","Great Expectations"
"likewise knew well. Their keeper had a brace of pistols, and carried a","Great Expectations"
"thick-knobbed bludgeon under his arm; but he was on terms of good","Great Expectations"
"understanding with them, and stood with them beside him, looking on at","Great Expectations"
"the putting-to of the horses, rather with an air as if the convicts","Great Expectations"
"were an interesting Exhibition not formally open at the moment, and he","Great Expectations"
"the Curator. One was a taller and stouter man than the other, and","Great Expectations"
"appeared as a matter of course, according to the mysterious ways of the","Great Expectations"
"world, both convict and free, to have had allotted to him the smaller","Great Expectations"
"suit of clothes. His arms and legs were like great pincushions of those","Great Expectations"
"shapes, and his attire disguised him absurdly; but I knew his","Great Expectations"
"half-closed eye at one glance. There stood the man whom I had seen on","Great Expectations"
"the settle at the Three Jolly Bargemen on a Saturday night, and who had","Great Expectations"
"brought me down with his invisible gun!","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was easy to make sure that as yet he knew me no more than if he had","Great Expectations"
"never seen me in his life. He looked across at me, and his eye","Great Expectations"
"appraised my watch-chain, and then he incidentally spat and said","Great Expectations"
"something to the other convict, and they laughed and slued themselves","Great Expectations"
"round with a clink of their coupling manacle, and looked at something","Great Expectations"
"else. The great numbers on their backs, as if they were street doors;","Great Expectations"
"their coarse mangy ungainly outer surface, as if they were lower","Great Expectations"
"animals; their ironed legs, apologetically garlanded with","Great Expectations"
"pocket-handkerchiefs; and the way in which all present looked at them","Great Expectations"
"and kept from them; made them (as Herbert had said) a most disagreeable","Great Expectations"
"and degraded spectacle.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"But this was not the worst of it. It came out that the whole of the","Great Expectations"
"back of the coach had been taken by a family removing from London, and","Great Expectations"
"that there were no places for the two prisoners but on the seat in","Great Expectations"
"front behind the coachman. Hereupon, a choleric gentleman, who had","Great Expectations"
"taken the fourth place on that seat, flew into a most violent passion,","Great Expectations"
"and said that it was a breach of contract to mix him up with such","Great Expectations"
"villainous company, and that it was poisonous, and pernicious, and","Great Expectations"
"infamous, and shameful, and I don’t know what else. At this time the","Great Expectations"
"coach was ready and the coachman impatient, and we were all preparing","Great Expectations"
"to get up, and the prisoners had come over with their keeper,—bringing","Great Expectations"
"with them that curious flavour of bread-poultice, baize, rope-yarn, and","Great Expectations"
"hearthstone, which attends the convict presence.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Don’t take it so much amiss, sir,” pleaded the keeper to the angry","Great Expectations"
"passenger; “I’ll sit next you myself. I’ll put ’em on the outside of","Great Expectations"
"the row. They won’t interfere with you, sir. You needn’t know they’re","Great Expectations"
"there.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And don’t blame _me_,” growled the convict I had recognised. “_I_","Great Expectations"
"don’t want to go. _I_ am quite ready to stay behind. As fur as I am","Great Expectations"
"concerned any one’s welcome to _my_ place.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Or mine,” said the other, gruffly. “_I_ wouldn’t have incommoded none","Great Expectations"
"of you, if I’d had _my_ way.” Then they both laughed, and began","Great Expectations"
"cracking nuts, and spitting the shells about.—As I really think I","Great Expectations"
"should have liked to do myself, if I had been in their place and so","Great Expectations"
"despised.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"At length, it was voted that there was no help for the angry gentleman,","Great Expectations"
"and that he must either go in his chance company or remain behind. So","Great Expectations"
"he got into his place, still making complaints, and the keeper got into","Great Expectations"
"the place next him, and the convicts hauled themselves up as well as","Great Expectations"
"they could, and the convict I had recognised sat behind me with his","Great Expectations"
"breath on the hair of my head.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Good-bye, Handel!” Herbert called out as we started. I thought what a","Great Expectations"
"blessed fortune it was, that he had found another name for me than Pip.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It is impossible to express with what acuteness I felt the convict’s","Great Expectations"
"breathing, not only on the back of my head, but all along my spine. The","Great Expectations"
"sensation was like being touched in the marrow with some pungent and","Great Expectations"
"searching acid, it set my very teeth on edge. He seemed to have more","Great Expectations"
"breathing business to do than another man, and to make more noise in","Great Expectations"
"doing it; and I was conscious of growing high-shouldered on one side,","Great Expectations"
"in my shrinking endeavours to fend him off.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The weather was miserably raw, and the two cursed the cold. It made us","Great Expectations"
"all lethargic before we had gone far, and when we had left the Half-way","Great Expectations"
"House behind, we habitually dozed and shivered and were silent. I dozed","Great Expectations"
"off, myself, in considering the question whether I ought to restore a","Great Expectations"
"couple of pounds sterling to this creature before losing sight of him,","Great Expectations"
"and how it could best be done. In the act of dipping forward as if I","Great Expectations"
"were going to bathe among the horses, I woke in a fright and took the","Great Expectations"
"question up again.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"But I must have lost it longer than I had thought, since, although I","Great Expectations"
"could recognise nothing in the darkness and the fitful lights and","Great Expectations"
"shadows of our lamps, I traced marsh country in the cold damp wind that","Great Expectations"
"blew at us. Cowering forward for warmth and to make me a screen against","Great Expectations"
"the wind, the convicts were closer to me than before. The very first","Great Expectations"
"words I heard them interchange as I became conscious, were the words of","Great Expectations"
"my own thought, “Two One Pound notes.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“How did he get ’em?” said the convict I had never seen.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“How should I know?” returned the other. “He had ’em stowed away","Great Expectations"
"somehows. Giv him by friends, I expect.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I wish,” said the other, with a bitter curse upon the cold, “that I","Great Expectations"
"had ’em here.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Two one pound notes, or friends?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Two one pound notes. I’d sell all the friends I ever had for one, and","Great Expectations"
"think it a blessed good bargain. Well? So he says—?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“So he says,” resumed the convict I had recognised,—“it was all said","Great Expectations"
"and done in half a minute, behind a pile of timber in the","Great Expectations"
"Dock-yard,—‘You’re a-going to be discharged?’ Yes, I was. Would I find","Great Expectations"
"out that boy that had fed him and kep his secret, and give him them two","Great Expectations"
"one pound notes? Yes, I would. And I did.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“More fool you,” growled the other. “I’d have spent ’em on a Man, in","Great Expectations"
"wittles and drink. He must have been a green one. Mean to say he knowed","Great Expectations"
"nothing of you?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Not a ha’porth. Different gangs and different ships. He was tried","Great Expectations"
"again for prison breaking, and got made a Lifer.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And was that—Honour!—the only time you worked out, in this part of the","Great Expectations"
"country?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“The only time.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What might have been your opinion of the place?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“A most beastly place. Mudbank, mist, swamp, and work; work, swamp,","Great Expectations"
"mist, and mudbank.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"They both execrated the place in very strong language, and gradually","Great Expectations"
"growled themselves out, and had nothing left to say.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"After overhearing this dialogue, I should assuredly have got down and","Great Expectations"
"been left in the solitude and darkness of the highway, but for feeling","Great Expectations"
"certain that the man had no suspicion of my identity. Indeed, I was not","Great Expectations"
"only so changed in the course of nature, but so differently dressed and","Great Expectations"
"so differently circumstanced, that it was not at all likely he could","Great Expectations"
"have known me without accidental help. Still, the coincidence of our","Great Expectations"
"being together on the coach, was sufficiently strange to fill me with a","Great Expectations"
"dread that some other coincidence might at any moment connect me, in","Great Expectations"
"his hearing, with my name. For this reason, I resolved to alight as","Great Expectations"
"soon as we touched the town, and put myself out of his hearing. This","Great Expectations"
"device I executed successfully. My little portmanteau was in the boot","Great Expectations"
"under my feet; I had but to turn a hinge to get it out; I threw it down","Great Expectations"
"before me, got down after it, and was left at the first lamp on the","Great Expectations"
"first stones of the town pavement. As to the convicts, they went their","Great Expectations"
"way with the coach, and I knew at what point they would be spirited off","Great Expectations"
"to the river. In my fancy, I saw the boat with its convict crew waiting","Great Expectations"
"for them at the slime-washed stairs,—again heard the gruff “Give way,","Great Expectations"
"you!” like and order to dogs,—again saw the wicked Noah’s Ark lying out","Great Expectations"
"on the black water.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I could not have said what I was afraid of, for my fear was altogether","Great Expectations"
"undefined and vague, but there was great fear upon me. As I walked on","Great Expectations"
"to the hotel, I felt that a dread, much exceeding the mere apprehension","Great Expectations"
"of a painful or disagreeable recognition, made me tremble. I am","Great Expectations"
"confident that it took no distinctness of shape, and that it was the","Great Expectations"
"revival for a few minutes of the terror of childhood.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The coffee-room at the Blue Boar was empty, and I had not only ordered","Great Expectations"
"my dinner there, but had sat down to it, before the waiter knew me. As","Great Expectations"
"soon as he had apologised for the remissness of his memory, he asked me","Great Expectations"
"if he should send Boots for Mr. Pumblechook?","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No,” said I, “certainly not.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The waiter (it was he who had brought up the Great Remonstrance from","Great Expectations"
"the Commercials, on the day when I was bound) appeared surprised, and","Great Expectations"
"took the earliest opportunity of putting a dirty old copy of a local","Great Expectations"
"newspaper so directly in my way, that I took it up and read this","Great Expectations"
"paragraph:—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Our readers will learn, not altogether without interest, in reference","Great Expectations"
"to the recent romantic rise in fortune of a young artificer in iron of","Great Expectations"
"this neighbourhood (what a theme, by the way, for the magic pen of our","Great Expectations"
"as yet not universally acknowledged townsman TOOBY, the poet of our","Great Expectations"
"columns!) that the youth’s earliest patron, companion, and friend, was","Great Expectations"
"a highly respected individual not entirely unconnected with the corn","Great Expectations"
"and seed trade, and whose eminently convenient and commodious business","Great Expectations"
"premises are situate within a hundred miles of the High Street. It is","Great Expectations"
"not wholly irrespective of our personal feelings that we record HIM as","Great Expectations"
"the Mentor of our young Telemachus, for it is good to know that our","Great Expectations"
"town produced the founder of the latter’s fortunes. Does the","Great Expectations"
"thought-contracted brow of the local Sage or the lustrous eye of local","Great Expectations"
"Beauty inquire whose fortunes? We believe that Quintin Matsys was the","Great Expectations"

"","Great Expectations"
"I entertain a conviction, based upon large experience, that if in the","Great Expectations"
"days of my prosperity I had gone to the North Pole, I should have met","Great Expectations"

"rooms, set the clocks a-going and the cold hearths a-blazing, tear down","Great Expectations"
"the cobwebs, destroy the vermin,—in short, do all the shining deeds of","Great Expectations"
"the young Knight of romance, and marry the Princess. I had stopped to","Great Expectations"
"look at the house as I passed; and its seared red brick walls, blocked","Great Expectations"
"windows, and strong green ivy clasping even the stacks of chimneys with","Great Expectations"
"its twigs and tendons, as if with sinewy old arms, had made up a rich","Great Expectations"
"attractive mystery, of which I was the hero. Estella was the","Great Expectations"
"inspiration of it, and the heart of it, of course. But, though she had","Great Expectations"
"taken such strong possession of me, though my fancy and my hope were so","Great Expectations"
"set upon her, though her influence on my boyish life and character had","Great Expectations"
"been all-powerful, I did not, even that romantic morning, invest her","Great Expectations"
"with any attributes save those she possessed. I mention this in this","Great Expectations"
"place, of a fixed purpose, because it is the clue by which I am to be","Great Expectations"
"followed into my poor labyrinth. According to my experience, the","Great Expectations"
"conventional notion of a lover cannot be always true. The unqualified","Great Expectations"
"truth is, that when I loved Estella with the love of a man, I loved her","Great Expectations"
"simply because I found her irresistible. Once for all; I knew to my","Great Expectations"
"sorrow, often and often, if not always, that I loved her against","Great Expectations"
"reason, against promise, against peace, against hope, against","Great Expectations"
"happiness, against all discouragement that could be. Once for all; I","Great Expectations"
"loved her none the less because I knew it, and it had no more influence","Great Expectations"
"in restraining me than if I had devoutly believed her to be human","Great Expectations"
"perfection.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I so shaped out my walk as to arrive at the gate at my old time. When I","Great Expectations"
"had rung at the bell with an unsteady hand, I turned my back upon the","Great Expectations"
"gate, while I tried to get my breath and keep the beating of my heart","Great Expectations"
"moderately quiet. I heard the side-door open, and steps come across the","Great Expectations"
"courtyard; but I pretended not to hear, even when the gate swung on its","Great Expectations"
"rusty hinges.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Being at last touched on the shoulder, I started and turned. I started","Great Expectations"
"much more naturally then, to find myself confronted by a man in a sober","Great Expectations"
"grey dress. The last man I should have expected to see in that place of","Great Expectations"
"porter at Miss Havisham’s door.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Orlick!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Ah, young master, there’s more changes than yours. But come in, come","Great Expectations"
"in. It’s opposed to my orders to hold the gate open.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I entered and he swung it, and locked it, and took the key out. “Yes!”","Great Expectations"
"said he, facing round, after doggedly preceding me a few steps towards","Great Expectations"
"the house. “Here I am!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“How did you come here?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I come here,” he retorted, “on my legs. I had my box brought alongside","Great Expectations"
"me in a barrow.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Are you here for good?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I ain’t here for harm, young master, I suppose?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I was not so sure of that. I had leisure to entertain the retort in my","Great Expectations"
"mind, while he slowly lifted his heavy glance from the pavement, up my","Great Expectations"
"legs and arms, to my face.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Then you have left the forge?” I said.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Do this look like a forge?” replied Orlick, sending his glance all","Great Expectations"
"round him with an air of injury. “Now, do it look like it?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I asked him how long he had left Gargery’s forge?","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“One day is so like another here,” he replied, “that I don’t know","Great Expectations"
"without casting it up. However, I come here some time since you left.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I could have told you that, Orlick.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Ah!” said he, dryly. “But then you’ve got to be a scholar.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"By this time we had come to the house, where I found his room to be one","Great Expectations"
"just within the side-door, with a little window in it looking on the","Great Expectations"
"courtyard. In its small proportions, it was not unlike the kind of","Great Expectations"
"place usually assigned to a gate-porter in Paris. Certain keys were","Great Expectations"
"hanging on the wall, to which he now added the gate key; and his","Great Expectations"
"patchwork-covered bed was in a little inner division or recess. The","Great Expectations"
"whole had a slovenly, confined, and sleepy look, like a cage for a","Great Expectations"
"human dormouse; while he, looming dark and heavy in the shadow of a","Great Expectations"
"corner by the window, looked like the human dormouse for whom it was","Great Expectations"
"fitted up,—as indeed he was.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I never saw this room before,” I remarked; “but there used to be no","Great Expectations"
"Porter here.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No,” said he; “not till it got about that there was no protection on","Great Expectations"
"the premises, and it come to be considered dangerous, with convicts and","Great Expectations"
"Tag and Rag and Bobtail going up and down. And then I was recommended","Great Expectations"
"to the place as a man who could give another man as good as he brought,","Great Expectations"
"and I took it. It’s easier than bellowsing and hammering.—That’s","Great Expectations"
"loaded, that is.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"My eye had been caught by a gun with a brass-bound stock over the","Great Expectations"
"chimney-piece, and his eye had followed mine.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well,” said I, not desirous of more conversation, “shall I go up to","Great Expectations"
"Miss Havisham?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Burn me, if I know!” he retorted, first stretching himself and then","Great Expectations"
"shaking himself; “my orders ends here, young master. I give this here","Great Expectations"
"bell a rap with this here hammer, and you go on along the passage till","Great Expectations"
"you meet somebody.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I am expected, I believe?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Burn me twice over, if I can say!” said he.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Upon that, I turned down the long passage which I had first trodden in","Great Expectations"
"my thick boots, and he made his bell sound. At the end of the passage,","Great Expectations"
"while the bell was still reverberating, I found Sarah Pocket, who","Great Expectations"
"appeared to have now become constitutionally green and yellow by reason","Great Expectations"
"of me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Oh!” said she. “You, is it, Mr. Pip?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It is, Miss Pocket. I am glad to tell you that Mr. Pocket and family","Great Expectations"
"are all well.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Are they any wiser?” said Sarah, with a dismal shake of the head;","Great Expectations"
"“they had better be wiser, than well. Ah, Matthew, Matthew! You know","Great Expectations"
"your way, sir?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Tolerably, for I had gone up the staircase in the dark, many a time. I","Great Expectations"
"ascended it now, in lighter boots than of yore, and tapped in my old","Great Expectations"
"way at the door of Miss Havisham’s room. “Pip’s rap,” I heard her say,","Great Expectations"
"immediately; “come in, Pip.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"She was in her chair near the old table, in the old dress, with her two","Great Expectations"
"hands crossed on her stick, her chin resting on them, and her eyes on","Great Expectations"
"the fire. Sitting near her, with the white shoe, that had never been","Great Expectations"
"worn, in her hand, and her head bent as she looked at it, was an","Great Expectations"
"elegant lady whom I had never seen.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Come in, Pip,” Miss Havisham continued to mutter, without looking","Great Expectations"
"round or up; “come in, Pip, how do you do, Pip? so you kiss my hand as","Great Expectations"
"if I were a queen, eh?—Well?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"She looked up at me suddenly, only moving her eyes, and repeated in a","Great Expectations"
"grimly playful manner,—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I heard, Miss Havisham,” said I, rather at a loss, “that you were so","Great Expectations"
"kind as to wish me to come and see you, and I came directly.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The lady whom I had never seen before, lifted up her eyes and looked","Great Expectations"
"archly at me, and then I saw that the eyes were Estella’s eyes. But she","Great Expectations"
"was so much changed, was so much more beautiful, so much more womanly,","Great Expectations"
"in all things winning admiration, had made such wonderful advance, that","Great Expectations"
"I seemed to have made none. I fancied, as I looked at her, that I","Great Expectations"
"slipped hopelessly back into the coarse and common boy again. O the","Great Expectations"
"sense of distance and disparity that came upon me, and the","Great Expectations"
"inaccessibility that came about her!","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"She gave me her hand. I stammered something about the pleasure I felt","Great Expectations"
"in seeing her again, and about my having looked forward to it, for a","Great Expectations"
"long, long time.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Do you find her much changed, Pip?” asked Miss Havisham, with her","Great Expectations"
"greedy look, and striking her stick upon a chair that stood between","Great Expectations"
"them, as a sign to me to sit down there.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“When I came in, Miss Havisham, I thought there was nothing of Estella","Great Expectations"
"in the face or figure; but now it all settles down so curiously into","Great Expectations"
"the old—”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What? You are not going to say into the old Estella?” Miss Havisham","Great Expectations"
"interrupted. “She was proud and insulting, and you wanted to go away","Great Expectations"
"from her. Don’t you remember?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I said confusedly that that was long ago, and that I knew no better","Great Expectations"
"then, and the like. Estella smiled with perfect composure, and said she","Great Expectations"
"had no doubt of my having been quite right, and of her having been very","Great Expectations"
"disagreeable.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Is _he_ changed?” Miss Havisham asked her.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Very much,” said Estella, looking at me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Less coarse and common?” said Miss Havisham, playing with Estella’s","Great Expectations"
"hair.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Estella laughed, and looked at the shoe in her hand, and laughed again,","Great Expectations"
"and looked at me, and put the shoe down. She treated me as a boy still,","Great Expectations"
"but she lured me on.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We sat in the dreamy room among the old strange influences which had so","Great Expectations"
"wrought upon me, and I learnt that she had but just come home from","Great Expectations"
"France, and that she was going to London. Proud and wilful as of old,","Great Expectations"
"she had brought those qualities into such subjection to her beauty that","Great Expectations"
"it was impossible and out of nature—or I thought so—to separate them","Great Expectations"
"from her beauty. Truly it was impossible to dissociate her presence","Great Expectations"
"from all those wretched hankerings after money and gentility that had","Great Expectations"
"disturbed my boyhood,—from all those ill-regulated aspirations that had","Great Expectations"
"first made me ashamed of home and Joe,—from all those visions that had","Great Expectations"
"raised her face in the glowing fire, struck it out of the iron on the","Great Expectations"
"anvil, extracted it from the darkness of night to look in at the wooden","Great Expectations"
"window of the forge, and flit away. In a word, it was impossible for me","Great Expectations"
"to separate her, in the past or in the present, from the innermost life","Great Expectations"
"of my life.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was settled that I should stay there all the rest of the day, and","Great Expectations"
"return to the hotel at night, and to London to-morrow. When we had","Great Expectations"
"conversed for a while, Miss Havisham sent us two out to walk in the","Great Expectations"
"neglected garden: on our coming in by and by, she said, I should wheel","Great Expectations"
"her about a little, as in times of yore.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"So, Estella and I went out into the garden by the gate through which I","Great Expectations"
"had strayed to my encounter with the pale young gentleman, now Herbert;","Great Expectations"
"I, trembling in spirit and worshipping the very hem of her dress; she,","Great Expectations"
"quite composed and most decidedly not worshipping the hem of mine. As","Great Expectations"
"we drew near to the place of encounter, she stopped and said,—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I must have been a singular little creature to hide and see that fight","Great Expectations"
"that day; but I did, and I enjoyed it very much.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You rewarded me very much.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Did I?” she replied, in an incidental and forgetful way. “I remember I","Great Expectations"
"entertained a great objection to your adversary, because I took it ill","Great Expectations"
"that he should be brought here to pester me with his company.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“He and I are great friends now.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Are you? I think I recollect though, that you read with his father?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I made the admission with reluctance, for it seemed to have a boyish","Great Expectations"
"look, and she already treated me more than enough like a boy.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Since your change of fortune and prospects, you have changed your","Great Expectations"
"companions,” said Estella.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Naturally,” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And necessarily,” she added, in a haughty tone; “what was fit company","Great Expectations"
"for you once, would be quite unfit company for you now.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"In my conscience, I doubt very much whether I had any lingering","Great Expectations"
"intention left of going to see Joe; but if I had, this observation put","Great Expectations"
"it to flight.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You had no idea of your impending good fortune, in those times?” said","Great Expectations"
"Estella, with a slight wave of her hand, signifying in the fighting","Great Expectations"
"times.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Not the least.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The air of completeness and superiority with which she walked at my","Great Expectations"
"side, and the air of youthfulness and submission with which I walked at","Great Expectations"
"hers, made a contrast that I strongly felt. It would have rankled in me","Great Expectations"
"more than it did, if I had not regarded myself as eliciting it by being","Great Expectations"
"so set apart for her and assigned to her.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The garden was too overgrown and rank for walking in with ease, and","Great Expectations"
"after we had made the round of it twice or thrice, we came out again","Great Expectations"
"into the brewery yard. I showed her to a nicety where I had seen her","Great Expectations"
"walking on the casks, that first old day, and she said, with a cold and","Great Expectations"
"careless look in that direction, “Did I?” I reminded her where she had","Great Expectations"
"come out of the house and given me my meat and drink, and she said, “I","Great Expectations"
"don’t remember.” “Not remember that you made me cry?” said I. “No,”","Great Expectations"
"said she, and shook her head and looked about her. I verily believe","Great Expectations"
"that her not remembering and not minding in the least, made me cry","Great Expectations"
"again, inwardly,—and that is the sharpest crying of all.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You must know,” said Estella, condescending to me as a brilliant and","Great Expectations"
"beautiful woman might, “that I have no heart,—if that has anything to","Great Expectations"
"do with my memory.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I got through some jargon to the effect that I took the liberty of","Great Expectations"
"doubting that. That I knew better. That there could be no such beauty","Great Expectations"
"without it.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Oh! I have a heart to be stabbed in or shot in, I have no doubt,” said","Great Expectations"
"Estella, “and of course if it ceased to beat I should cease to be. But","Great Expectations"
"you know what I mean. I have no softness there,","Great Expectations"
"no—sympathy—sentiment—nonsense.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"What _was_ it that was borne in upon my mind when she stood still and","Great Expectations"
"looked attentively at me? Anything that I had seen in Miss Havisham?","Great Expectations"
"No. In some of her looks and gestures there was that tinge of","Great Expectations"
"resemblance to Miss Havisham which may often be noticed to have been","Great Expectations"
"acquired by children, from grown person with whom they have been much","Great Expectations"
"associated and secluded, and which, when childhood is passed, will","Great Expectations"
"produce a remarkable occasional likeness of expression between faces","Great Expectations"
"that are otherwise quite different. And yet I could not trace this to","Great Expectations"
"Miss Havisham. I looked again, and though she was still looking at me,","Great Expectations"
"the suggestion was gone.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"What _was_ it?","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I am serious,” said Estella, not so much with a frown (for her brow","Great Expectations"
"was smooth) as with a darkening of her face; “if we are to be thrown","Great Expectations"
"much together, you had better believe it at once. No!” imperiously","Great Expectations"
"stopping me as I opened my lips. “I have not bestowed my tenderness","Great Expectations"
"anywhere. I have never had any such thing.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"In another moment we were in the brewery, so long disused, and she","Great Expectations"
"pointed to the high gallery where I had seen her going out on that same","Great Expectations"
"first day, and told me she remembered to have been up there, and to","Great Expectations"
"have seen me standing scared below. As my eyes followed her white hand,","Great Expectations"
"again the same dim suggestion that I could not possibly grasp crossed","Great Expectations"
"me. My involuntary start occasioned her to lay her hand upon my arm.","Great Expectations"
"Instantly the ghost passed once more and was gone.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"What _was_ it?","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What is the matter?” asked Estella. “Are you scared again?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I should be, if I believed what you said just now,” I replied, to turn","Great Expectations"
"it off.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Then you don’t? Very well. It is said, at any rate. Miss Havisham will","Great Expectations"
"soon be expecting you at your old post, though I think that might be","Great Expectations"
"laid aside now, with other old belongings. Let us make one more round","Great Expectations"
"of the garden, and then go in. Come! You shall not shed tears for my","Great Expectations"
"cruelty to-day; you shall be my Page, and give me your shoulder.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Her handsome dress had trailed upon the ground. She held it in one hand","Great Expectations"
"now, and with the other lightly touched my shoulder as we walked. We","Great Expectations"
"walked round the ruined garden twice or thrice more, and it was all in","Great Expectations"
"bloom for me. If the green and yellow growth of weed in the chinks of","Great Expectations"
"the old wall had been the most precious flowers that ever blew, it","Great Expectations"
"could not have been more cherished in my remembrance.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"There was no discrepancy of years between us to remove her far from me;","Great Expectations"
"we were of nearly the same age, though of course the age told for more","Great Expectations"
"in her case than in mine; but the air of inaccessibility which her","Great Expectations"
"beauty and her manner gave her, tormented me in the midst of my","Great Expectations"
"delight, and at the height of the assurance I felt that our patroness","Great Expectations"
"had chosen us for one another. Wretched boy!","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"At last we went back into the house, and there I heard, with surprise,","Great Expectations"
"that my guardian had come down to see Miss Havisham on business, and","Great Expectations"
"would come back to dinner. The old wintry branches of chandeliers in","Great Expectations"
"the room where the mouldering table was spread had been lighted while","Great Expectations"
"we were out, and Miss Havisham was in her chair and waiting for me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was like pushing the chair itself back into the past, when we began","Great Expectations"
"the old slow circuit round about the ashes of the bridal feast. But, in","Great Expectations"
"the funereal room, with that figure of the grave fallen back in the","Great Expectations"
"chair fixing its eyes upon her, Estella looked more bright and","Great Expectations"
"beautiful than before, and I was under stronger enchantment.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The time so melted away, that our early dinner-hour drew close at hand,","Great Expectations"
"and Estella left us to prepare herself. We had stopped near the centre","Great Expectations"
"of the long table, and Miss Havisham, with one of her withered arms","Great Expectations"
"stretched out of the chair, rested that clenched hand upon the yellow","Great Expectations"
"cloth. As Estella looked back over her shoulder before going out at the","Great Expectations"
"door, Miss Havisham kissed that hand to her, with a ravenous intensity","Great Expectations"
"that was of its kind quite dreadful.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Then, Estella being gone and we two left alone, she turned to me, and","Great Expectations"
"said in a whisper,—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Is she beautiful, graceful, well-grown? Do you admire her?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Everybody must who sees her, Miss Havisham.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"She drew an arm round my neck, and drew my head close down to hers as","Great Expectations"
"she sat in the chair. “Love her, love her, love her! How does she use","Great Expectations"
"you?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Before I could answer (if I could have answered so difficult a question","Great Expectations"
"at all) she repeated, “Love her, love her, love her! If she favours","Great Expectations"
"you, love her. If she wounds you, love her. If she tears your heart to","Great Expectations"
"pieces,—and as it gets older and stronger it will tear deeper,—love","Great Expectations"
"her, love her, love her!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Never had I seen such passionate eagerness as was joined to her","Great Expectations"
"utterance of these words. I could feel the muscles of the thin arm","Great Expectations"
"round my neck swell with the vehemence that possessed her.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Hear me, Pip! I adopted her, to be loved. I bred her and educated her,","Great Expectations"
"to be loved. I developed her into what she is, that she might be loved.","Great Expectations"
"Love her!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"She said the word often enough, and there could be no doubt that she","Great Expectations"
"meant to say it; but if the often repeated word had been hate instead","Great Expectations"
"of love—despair—revenge—dire death—it could not have sounded from her","Great Expectations"
"lips more like a curse.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I’ll tell you,” said she, in the same hurried passionate whisper,","Great Expectations"
"“what real love is. It is blind devotion, unquestioning","Great Expectations"
"self-humiliation, utter submission, trust and belief against yourself","Great Expectations"
"and against the whole world, giving up your whole heart and soul to the","Great Expectations"
"smiter—as I did!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"When she came to that, and to a wild cry that followed that, I caught","Great Expectations"
"her round the waist. For she rose up in the chair, in her shroud of a","Great Expectations"
"dress, and struck at the air as if she would as soon have struck","Great Expectations"
"herself against the wall and fallen dead.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"All this passed in a few seconds. As I drew her down into her chair, I","Great Expectations"
"was conscious of a scent that I knew, and turning, saw my guardian in","Great Expectations"
"the room.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He always carried (I have not yet mentioned it, I think) a","Great Expectations"
"pocket-handkerchief of rich silk and of imposing proportions, which was","Great Expectations"
"of great value to him in his profession. I have seen him so terrify a","Great Expectations"
"client or a witness by ceremoniously unfolding this pocket-handkerchief","Great Expectations"
"as if he were immediately going to blow his nose, and then pausing, as","Great Expectations"
"if he knew he should not have time to do it before such client or","Great Expectations"
"witness committed himself, that the self-committal has followed","Great Expectations"
"directly, quite as a matter of course. When I saw him in the room he","Great Expectations"
"had this expressive pocket-handkerchief in both hands, and was looking","Great Expectations"
"at us. On meeting my eye, he said plainly, by a momentary and silent","Great Expectations"
"pause in that attitude, “Indeed? Singular!” and then put the","Great Expectations"
"handkerchief to its right use with wonderful effect.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Miss Havisham had seen him as soon as I, and was (like everybody else)","Great Expectations"
"afraid of him. She made a strong attempt to compose herself, and","Great Expectations"
"stammered that he was as punctual as ever.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“As punctual as ever,” he repeated, coming up to us. “(How do you do,","Great Expectations"
"Pip? Shall I give you a ride, Miss Havisham? Once round?) And so you","Great Expectations"
"are here, Pip?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I told him when I had arrived, and how Miss Havisham had wished me to","Great Expectations"
"come and see Estella. To which he replied, “Ah! Very fine young lady!”","Great Expectations"
"Then he pushed Miss Havisham in her chair before him, with one of his","Great Expectations"
"large hands, and put the other in his trousers-pocket as if the pocket","Great Expectations"
"were full of secrets.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well, Pip! How often have you seen Miss Estella before?” said he, when","Great Expectations"
"he came to a stop.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“How often?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Ah! How many times? Ten thousand times?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Oh! Certainly not so many.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Twice?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Jaggers,” interposed Miss Havisham, much to my relief, “leave my Pip","Great Expectations"
"alone, and go with him to your dinner.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He complied, and we groped our way down the dark stairs together. While","Great Expectations"
"we were still on our way to those detached apartments across the paved","Great Expectations"
"yard at the back, he asked me how often I had seen Miss Havisham eat","Great Expectations"
"and drink; offering me a breadth of choice, as usual, between a hundred","Great Expectations"
"times and once.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I considered, and said, “Never.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And never will, Pip,” he retorted, with a frowning smile. “She has","Great Expectations"
"never allowed herself to be seen doing either, since she lived this","Great Expectations"
"present life of hers. She wanders about in the night, and then lays","Great Expectations"
"hands on such food as she takes.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Pray, sir,” said I, “may I ask you a question?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You may,” said he, “and I may decline to answer it. Put your","Great Expectations"

"","Great Expectations"
"“Estella’s name. Is it Havisham or—?” I had nothing to add.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Or what?” said he.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Is it Havisham?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It is Havisham.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"This brought us to the dinner-table, where she and Sarah Pocket awaited","Great Expectations"
"us. Mr. Jaggers presided, Estella sat opposite to him, I faced my green","Great Expectations"
"and yellow friend. We dined very well, and were waited on by a","Great Expectations"
"maid-servant whom I had never seen in all my comings and goings, but","Great Expectations"
"who, for anything I know, had been in that mysterious house the whole","Great Expectations"
"time. After dinner a bottle of choice old port was placed before my","Great Expectations"
"guardian (he was evidently well acquainted with the vintage), and the","Great Expectations"
"two ladies left us.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Anything to equal the determined reticence of Mr. Jaggers under that","Great Expectations"
"roof I never saw elsewhere, even in him. He kept his very looks to","Great Expectations"
"himself, and scarcely directed his eyes to Estella’s face once during","Great Expectations"
"dinner. When she spoke to him, he listened, and in due course answered,","Great Expectations"
"but never looked at her, that I could see. On the other hand, she often","Great Expectations"
"looked at him, with interest and curiosity, if not distrust, but his","Great Expectations"
"face never showed the least consciousness. Throughout dinner he took a","Great Expectations"
"dry delight in making Sarah Pocket greener and yellower, by often","Great Expectations"
"referring in conversation with me to my expectations; but here, again,","Great Expectations"
"he showed no consciousness, and even made it appear that he","Great Expectations"
"extorted—and even did extort, though I don’t know how—those references","Great Expectations"
"out of my innocent self.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"And when he and I were left alone together, he sat with an air upon him","Great Expectations"
"of general lying by in consequence of information he possessed, that","Great Expectations"
"really was too much for me. He cross-examined his very wine when he had","Great Expectations"
"nothing else in hand. He held it between himself and the candle, tasted","Great Expectations"
"the port, rolled it in his mouth, swallowed it, looked at his glass","Great Expectations"
"again, smelt the port, tried it, drank it, filled again, and","Great Expectations"
"cross-examined the glass again, until I was as nervous as if I had","Great Expectations"
"known the wine to be telling him something to my disadvantage. Three or","Great Expectations"
"four times I feebly thought I would start conversation; but whenever he","Great Expectations"
"saw me going to ask him anything, he looked at me with his glass in his","Great Expectations"
"hand, and rolling his wine about in his mouth, as if requesting me to","Great Expectations"
"take notice that it was of no use, for he couldn’t answer.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I think Miss Pocket was conscious that the sight of me involved her in","Great Expectations"
"the danger of being goaded to madness, and perhaps tearing off her","Great Expectations"
"cap,—which was a very hideous one, in the nature of a muslin mop,—and","Great Expectations"
"strewing the ground with her hair,—which assuredly had never grown on","Great Expectations"
"_her_ head. She did not appear when we afterwards went up to Miss","Great Expectations"
"Havisham’s room, and we four played at whist. In the interval, Miss","Great Expectations"
"Havisham, in a fantastic way, had put some of the most beautiful jewels","Great Expectations"
"from her dressing-table into Estella’s hair, and about her bosom and","Great Expectations"
"arms; and I saw even my guardian look at her from under his thick","Great Expectations"
"eyebrows, and raise them a little, when her loveliness was before him,","Great Expectations"
"with those rich flushes of glitter and colour in it.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"[Illustration]","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Of the manner and extent to which he took our trumps into custody, and","Great Expectations"
"came out with mean little cards at the ends of hands, before which the","Great Expectations"
"glory of our Kings and Queens was utterly abased, I say nothing; nor,","Great Expectations"
"of the feeling that I had, respecting his looking upon us personally in","Great Expectations"
"the light of three very obvious and poor riddles that he had found out","Great Expectations"
"long ago. What I suffered from, was the incompatibility between his","Great Expectations"
"cold presence and my feelings towards Estella. It was not that I knew I","Great Expectations"
"could never bear to speak to him about her, that I knew I could never","Great Expectations"
"bear to hear him creak his boots at her, that I knew I could never bear","Great Expectations"
"to see him wash his hands of her; it was, that my admiration should be","Great Expectations"
"within a foot or two of him,—it was, that my feelings should be in the","Great Expectations"
"same place with him,—_that_, was the agonizing circumstance.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We played until nine o’clock, and then it was arranged that when","Great Expectations"
"Estella came to London I should be forewarned of her coming and should","Great Expectations"
"meet her at the coach; and then I took leave of her, and touched her","Great Expectations"
"and left her.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"My guardian lay at the Boar in the next room to mine. Far into the","Great Expectations"
"night, Miss Havisham’s words, “Love her, love her, love her!” sounded","Great Expectations"
"in my ears. I adapted them for my own repetition, and said to my","Great Expectations"
"pillow, “I love her, I love her, I love her!” hundreds of times. Then,","Great Expectations"
"a burst of gratitude came upon me, that she should be destined for me,","Great Expectations"
"once the blacksmith’s boy. Then I thought if she were, as I feared, by","Great Expectations"
"no means rapturously grateful for that destiny yet, when would she","Great Expectations"
"begin to be interested in me? When should I awaken the heart within her","Great Expectations"
"that was mute and sleeping now?","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Ah me! I thought those were high and great emotions. But I never","Great Expectations"
"thought there was anything low and small in my keeping away from Joe,","Great Expectations"
"because I knew she would be contemptuous of him. It was but a day gone,","Great Expectations"
"and Joe had brought the tears into my eyes; they had soon dried, God","Great Expectations"
"forgive me! soon dried.","Great Expectations"

"Chapter XXX.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"After well considering the matter while I was dressing at the Blue Boar","Great Expectations"
"in the morning, I resolved to tell my guardian that I doubted Orlick’s","Great Expectations"
"being the right sort of man to fill a post of trust at Miss Havisham’s.","Great Expectations"
"“Why of course he is not the right sort of man, Pip,” said my guardian,","Great Expectations"
"comfortably satisfied beforehand on the general head, “because the man","Great Expectations"
"who fills the post of trust never is the right sort of man.” It seemed","Great Expectations"
"quite to put him into spirits to find that this particular post was not","Great Expectations"
"exceptionally held by the right sort of man, and he listened in a","Great Expectations"
"satisfied manner while I told him what knowledge I had of Orlick. “Very","Great Expectations"
"good, Pip,” he observed, when I had concluded, “I’ll go round","Great Expectations"
"presently, and pay our friend off.” Rather alarmed by this summary","Great Expectations"
"action, I was for a little delay, and even hinted that our friend","Great Expectations"
"himself might be difficult to deal with. “Oh no he won’t,” said my","Great Expectations"
"guardian, making his pocket-handkerchief-point, with perfect","Great Expectations"
"confidence; “I should like to see him argue the question with _me_.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As we were going back together to London by the midday coach, and as I","Great Expectations"
"breakfasted under such terrors of Pumblechook that I could scarcely","Great Expectations"
"hold my cup, this gave me an opportunity of saying that I wanted a","Great Expectations"
"walk, and that I would go on along the London road while Mr. Jaggers","Great Expectations"
"was occupied, if he would let the coachman know that I would get into","Great Expectations"
"my place when overtaken. I was thus enabled to fly from the Blue Boar","Great Expectations"
"immediately after breakfast. By then making a loop of about a couple of","Great Expectations"
"miles into the open country at the back of Pumblechook’s premises, I","Great Expectations"
"got round into the High Street again, a little beyond that pitfall, and","Great Expectations"
"felt myself in comparative security.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was interesting to be in the quiet old town once more, and it was","Great Expectations"
"not disagreeable to be here and there suddenly recognised and stared","Great Expectations"
"after. One or two of the tradespeople even darted out of their shops","Great Expectations"
"and went a little way down the street before me, that they might turn,","Great Expectations"
"as if they had forgotten something, and pass me face to face,—on which","Great Expectations"
"occasions I don’t know whether they or I made the worse pretence; they","Great Expectations"
"of not doing it, or I of not seeing it. Still my position was a","Great Expectations"
"distinguished one, and I was not at all dissatisfied with it, until","Great Expectations"
"Fate threw me in the way of that unlimited miscreant, Trabb’s boy.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Casting my eyes along the street at a certain point of my progress, I","Great Expectations"
"beheld Trabb’s boy approaching, lashing himself with an empty blue bag.","Great Expectations"
"Deeming that a serene and unconscious contemplation of him would best","Great Expectations"
"beseem me, and would be most likely to quell his evil mind, I advanced","Great Expectations"
"with that expression of countenance, and was rather congratulating","Great Expectations"
"myself on my success, when suddenly the knees of Trabb’s boy smote","Great Expectations"
"together, his hair uprose, his cap fell off, he trembled violently in","Great Expectations"
"every limb, staggered out into the road, and crying to the populace,","Great Expectations"
"“Hold me! I’m so frightened!” feigned to be in a paroxysm of terror and","Great Expectations"
"contrition, occasioned by the dignity of my appearance. As I passed","Great Expectations"
"him, his teeth loudly chattered in his head, and with every mark of","Great Expectations"
"extreme humiliation, he prostrated himself in the dust.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"This was a hard thing to bear, but this was nothing. I had not advanced","Great Expectations"
"another two hundred yards when, to my inexpressible terror, amazement,","Great Expectations"
"and indignation, I again beheld Trabb’s boy approaching. He was coming","Great Expectations"
"round a narrow corner. His blue bag was slung over his shoulder, honest","Great Expectations"
"industry beamed in his eyes, a determination to proceed to Trabb’s with","Great Expectations"
"cheerful briskness was indicated in his gait. With a shock he became","Great Expectations"
"aware of me, and was severely visited as before; but this time his","Great Expectations"
"motion was rotatory, and he staggered round and round me with knees","Great Expectations"
"more afflicted, and with uplifted hands as if beseeching for mercy. His","Great Expectations"
"sufferings were hailed with the greatest joy by a knot of spectators,","Great Expectations"
"and I felt utterly confounded.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I had not got as much further down the street as the post-office, when","Great Expectations"
"I again beheld Trabb’s boy shooting round by a back way. This time, he","Great Expectations"
"was entirely changed. He wore the blue bag in the manner of my","Great Expectations"
"great-coat, and was strutting along the pavement towards me on the","Great Expectations"
"opposite side of the street, attended by a company of delighted young","Great Expectations"
"friends to whom he from time to time exclaimed, with a wave of his","Great Expectations"
"hand, “Don’t know yah!” Words cannot state the amount of aggravation","Great Expectations"
"and injury wreaked upon me by Trabb’s boy, when passing abreast of me,","Great Expectations"
"he pulled up his shirt-collar, twined his side-hair, stuck an arm","Great Expectations"
"akimbo, and smirked extravagantly by, wriggling his elbows and body,","Great Expectations"
"and drawling to his attendants, “Don’t know yah, don’t know yah, ’pon","Great Expectations"
"my soul don’t know yah!” The disgrace attendant on his immediately","Great Expectations"
"afterwards taking to crowing and pursuing me across the bridge with","Great Expectations"
"crows, as from an exceedingly dejected fowl who had known me when I was","Great Expectations"
"a blacksmith, culminated the disgrace with which I left the town, and","Great Expectations"
"was, so to speak, ejected by it into the open country.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"[Illustration]","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"But unless I had taken the life of Trabb’s boy on that occasion, I","Great Expectations"
"really do not even now see what I could have done save endure. To have","Great Expectations"
"struggled with him in the street, or to have exacted any lower","Great Expectations"
"recompense from him than his heart’s best blood, would have been futile","Great Expectations"
"and degrading. Moreover, he was a boy whom no man could hurt; an","Great Expectations"
"invulnerable and dodging serpent who, when chased into a corner, flew","Great Expectations"
"out again between his captor’s legs, scornfully yelping. I wrote,","Great Expectations"
"however, to Mr. Trabb by next day’s post, to say that Mr. Pip must","Great Expectations"
"decline to deal further with one who could so far forget what he owed","Great Expectations"
"to the best interests of society, as to employ a boy who excited","Great Expectations"
"Loathing in every respectable mind.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The coach, with Mr. Jaggers inside, came up in due time, and I took my","Great Expectations"
"box-seat again, and arrived in London safe,—but not sound, for my heart","Great Expectations"
"was gone. As soon as I arrived, I sent a penitential codfish and barrel","Great Expectations"
"of oysters to Joe (as reparation for not having gone myself), and then","Great Expectations"
"went on to Barnard’s Inn.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I found Herbert dining on cold meat, and delighted to welcome me back.","Great Expectations"
"Having despatched The Avenger to the coffee-house for an addition to","Great Expectations"
"the dinner, I felt that I must open my breast that very evening to my","Great Expectations"
"friend and chum. As confidence was out of the question with The Avenger","Great Expectations"
"in the hall, which could merely be regarded in the light of an","Great Expectations"
"antechamber to the keyhole, I sent him to the Play. A better proof of","Great Expectations"
"the severity of my bondage to that taskmaster could scarcely be","Great Expectations"
"afforded, than the degrading shifts to which I was constantly driven to","Great Expectations"
"find him employment. So mean is extremity, that I sometimes sent him to","Great Expectations"
"Hyde Park corner to see what o’clock it was.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Dinner done and we sitting with our feet upon the fender, I said to","Great Expectations"
"Herbert, “My dear Herbert, I have something very particular to tell","Great Expectations"
"you.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“My dear Handel,” he returned, “I shall esteem and respect your","Great Expectations"
"confidence.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It concerns myself, Herbert,” said I, “and one other person.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Herbert crossed his feet, looked at the fire with his head on one side,","Great Expectations"
"and having looked at it in vain for some time, looked at me because I","Great Expectations"
"didn’t go on.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Herbert,” said I, laying my hand upon his knee, “I love—I","Great Expectations"
"adore—Estella.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Instead of being transfixed, Herbert replied in an easy","Great Expectations"
"matter-of-course way, “Exactly. Well?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well, Herbert? Is that all you say? Well?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What next, I mean?” said Herbert. “Of course I know _that_.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“How do you know it?” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“How do I know it, Handel? Why, from you.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I never told you.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Told me! You have never told me when you have got your hair cut, but I","Great Expectations"
"have had senses to perceive it. You have always adored her, ever since","Great Expectations"
"I have known you. You brought your adoration and your portmanteau here","Great Expectations"
"together. Told me! Why, you have always told me all day long. When you","Great Expectations"
"told me your own story, you told me plainly that you began adoring her","Great Expectations"
"the first time you saw her, when you were very young indeed.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Very well, then,” said I, to whom this was a new and not unwelcome","Great Expectations"
"light, “I have never left off adoring her. And she has come back, a","Great Expectations"
"most beautiful and most elegant creature. And I saw her yesterday. And","Great Expectations"
"if I adored her before, I now doubly adore her.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Lucky for you then, Handel,” said Herbert, “that you are picked out","Great Expectations"
"for her and allotted to her. Without encroaching on forbidden ground,","Great Expectations"
"we may venture to say that there can be no doubt between ourselves of","Great Expectations"
"that fact. Have you any idea yet, of Estella’s views on the adoration","Great Expectations"
"question?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I shook my head gloomily. “Oh! She is thousands of miles away, from","Great Expectations"
"me,” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Patience, my dear Handel: time enough, time enough. But you have","Great Expectations"
"something more to say?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I am ashamed to say it,” I returned, “and yet it’s no worse to say it","Great Expectations"
"than to think it. You call me a lucky fellow. Of course, I am. I was a","Great Expectations"
"blacksmith’s boy but yesterday; I am—what shall I say I am—to-day?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Say a good fellow, if you want a phrase,” returned Herbert, smiling,","Great Expectations"
"and clapping his hand on the back of mine—“a good fellow, with","Great Expectations"
"impetuosity and hesitation, boldness and diffidence, action and","Great Expectations"
"dreaming, curiously mixed in him.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I stopped for a moment to consider whether there really was this","Great Expectations"
"mixture in my character. On the whole, I by no means recognised the","Great Expectations"
"analysis, but thought it not worth disputing.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“When I ask what I am to call myself to-day, Herbert,” I went on, “I","Great Expectations"
"suggest what I have in my thoughts. You say I am lucky. I know I have","Great Expectations"
"done nothing to raise myself in life, and that Fortune alone has raised","Great Expectations"
"me; that is being very lucky. And yet, when I think of Estella—”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"(“And when don’t you, you know?” Herbert threw in, with his eyes on the","Great Expectations"
"fire; which I thought kind and sympathetic of him.)","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“—Then, my dear Herbert, I cannot tell you how dependent and uncertain","Great Expectations"
"I feel, and how exposed to hundreds of chances. Avoiding forbidden","Great Expectations"
"ground, as you did just now, I may still say that on the constancy of","Great Expectations"
"one person (naming no person) all my expectations depend. And at the","Great Expectations"
"best, how indefinite and unsatisfactory, only to know so vaguely what","Great Expectations"
"they are!” In saying this, I relieved my mind of what had always been","Great Expectations"
"there, more or less, though no doubt most since yesterday.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Now, Handel,” Herbert replied, in his gay, hopeful way, “it seems to","Great Expectations"
"me that in the despondency of the tender passion, we are looking into","Great Expectations"
"our gift-horse’s mouth with a magnifying-glass. Likewise, it seems to","Great Expectations"
"me that, concentrating our attention on the examination, we altogether","Great Expectations"
"overlook one of the best points of the animal. Didn’t you tell me that","Great Expectations"
"your guardian, Mr. Jaggers, told you in the beginning, that you were","Great Expectations"
"not endowed with expectations only? And even if he had not told you","Great Expectations"
"so,—though that is a very large If, I grant,—could you believe that of","Great Expectations"
"all men in London, Mr. Jaggers is the man to hold his present relations","Great Expectations"
"towards you unless he were sure of his ground?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I said I could not deny that this was a strong point. I said it (people","Great Expectations"
"often do so, in such cases) like a rather reluctant concession to truth","Great Expectations"
"and justice;—as if I wanted to deny it!","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I should think it _was_ a strong point,” said Herbert, “and I should","Great Expectations"
"think you would be puzzled to imagine a stronger; as to the rest, you","Great Expectations"
"must bide your guardian’s time, and he must bide his client’s time.","Great Expectations"
"You’ll be one-and-twenty before you know where you are, and then","Great Expectations"
"perhaps you’ll get some further enlightenment. At all events, you’ll be","Great Expectations"
"nearer getting it, for it must come at last.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What a hopeful disposition you have!” said I, gratefully admiring his","Great Expectations"
"cheery ways.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I ought to have,” said Herbert, “for I have not much else. I must","Great Expectations"
"acknowledge, by the by, that the good sense of what I have just said is","Great Expectations"
"not my own, but my father’s. The only remark I ever heard him make on","Great Expectations"
"your story, was the final one, “The thing is settled and done, or Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Jaggers would not be in it.” And now before I say anything more about","Great Expectations"
"my father, or my father’s son, and repay confidence with confidence, I","Great Expectations"
"want to make myself seriously disagreeable to you for a","Great Expectations"
"moment,—positively repulsive.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You won’t succeed,” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“O yes I shall!” said he. “One, two, three, and now I am in for it.","Great Expectations"
"Handel, my good fellow;”—though he spoke in this light tone, he was","Great Expectations"
"very much in earnest,—“I have been thinking since we have been talking","Great Expectations"
"with our feet on this fender, that Estella surely cannot be a condition","Great Expectations"
"of your inheritance, if she was never referred to by your guardian. Am","Great Expectations"
"I right in so understanding what you have told me, as that he never","Great Expectations"
"referred to her, directly or indirectly, in any way? Never even hinted,","Great Expectations"
"for instance, that your patron might have views as to your marriage","Great Expectations"
"ultimately?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Never.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Now, Handel, I am quite free from the flavour of sour grapes, upon my","Great Expectations"
"soul and honour! Not being bound to her, can you not detach yourself","Great Expectations"
"from her?—I told you I should be disagreeable.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I turned my head aside, for, with a rush and a sweep, like the old","Great Expectations"
"marsh winds coming up from the sea, a feeling like that which had","Great Expectations"
"subdued me on the morning when I left the forge, when the mists were","Great Expectations"
"solemnly rising, and when I laid my hand upon the village finger-post,","Great Expectations"
"smote upon my heart again. There was silence between us for a little","Great Expectations"
"while.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes; but my dear Handel,” Herbert went on, as if we had been talking,","Great Expectations"
"instead of silent, “its having been so strongly rooted in the breast of","Great Expectations"
"a boy whom nature and circumstances made so romantic, renders it very","Great Expectations"
"serious. Think of her bringing-up, and think of Miss Havisham. Think of","Great Expectations"
"what she is herself (now I am repulsive and you abominate me). This may","Great Expectations"
"lead to miserable things.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I know it, Herbert,” said I, with my head still turned away, “but I","Great Expectations"
"can’t help it.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You can’t detach yourself?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No. Impossible!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You can’t try, Handel?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No. Impossible!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well!” said Herbert, getting up with a lively shake as if he had been","Great Expectations"
"asleep, and stirring the fire, “now I’ll endeavour to make myself","Great Expectations"
"agreeable again!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"So he went round the room and shook the curtains out, put the chairs in","Great Expectations"
"their places, tidied the books and so forth that were lying about,","Great Expectations"
"looked into the hall, peeped into the letter-box, shut the door, and","Great Expectations"
"came back to his chair by the fire: where he sat down, nursing his left","Great Expectations"
"leg in both arms.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I was going to say a word or two, Handel, concerning my father and my","Great Expectations"
"father’s son. I am afraid it is scarcely necessary for my father’s son","Great Expectations"
"to remark that my father’s establishment is not particularly brilliant","Great Expectations"
"in its housekeeping.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“There is always plenty, Herbert,” said I, to say something","Great Expectations"
"encouraging.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“O yes! and so the dustman says, I believe, with the strongest","Great Expectations"
"approval, and so does the marine-store shop in the back street.","Great Expectations"
"Gravely, Handel, for the subject is grave enough, you know how it is as","Great Expectations"
"well as I do. I suppose there was a time once when my father had not","Great Expectations"
"given matters up; but if ever there was, the time is gone. May I ask","Great Expectations"
"you if you have ever had an opportunity of remarking, down in your part","Great Expectations"
"of the country, that the children of not exactly suitable marriages are","Great Expectations"
"always most particularly anxious to be married?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"This was such a singular question, that I asked him in return, “Is it","Great Expectations"
"so?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I don’t know,” said Herbert, “that’s what I want to know. Because it","Great Expectations"
"is decidedly the case with us. My poor sister Charlotte, who was next","Great Expectations"
"me and died before she was fourteen, was a striking example. Little","Great Expectations"
"Jane is the same. In her desire to be matrimonially established, you","Great Expectations"
"might suppose her to have passed her short existence in the perpetual","Great Expectations"
"contemplation of domestic bliss. Little Alick in a frock has already","Great Expectations"
"made arrangements for his union with a suitable young person at Kew.","Great Expectations"
"And indeed, I think we are all engaged, except the baby.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Then you are?” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I am,” said Herbert; “but it’s a secret.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I assured him of my keeping the secret, and begged to be favoured with","Great Expectations"
"further particulars. He had spoken so sensibly and feelingly of my","Great Expectations"
"weakness that I wanted to know something about his strength.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“May I ask the name?” I said.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Name of Clara,” said Herbert.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Live in London?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, perhaps I ought to mention,” said Herbert, who had become","Great Expectations"
"curiously crestfallen and meek, since we entered on the interesting","Great Expectations"
"theme, “that she is rather below my mother’s nonsensical family","Great Expectations"
"notions. Her father had to do with the victualling of passenger-ships.","Great Expectations"
"I think he was a species of purser.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What is he now?” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“He’s an invalid now,” replied Herbert.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Living on—?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“On the first floor,” said Herbert. Which was not at all what I meant,","Great Expectations"
"for I had intended my question to apply to his means. “I have never","Great Expectations"
"seen him, for he has always kept his room overhead, since I have known","Great Expectations"
"Clara. But I have heard him constantly. He makes tremendous","Great Expectations"
"rows,—roars, and pegs at the floor with some frightful instrument.” In","Great Expectations"
"looking at me and then laughing heartily, Herbert for the time","Great Expectations"
"recovered his usual lively manner.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Don’t you expect to see him?” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“O yes, I constantly expect to see him,” returned Herbert, “because I","Great Expectations"
"never hear him, without expecting him to come tumbling through the","Great Expectations"
"ceiling. But I don’t know how long the rafters may hold.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"When he had once more laughed heartily, he became meek again, and told","Great Expectations"
"me that the moment he began to realise Capital, it was his intention to","Great Expectations"
"marry this young lady. He added as a self-evident proposition,","Great Expectations"
"engendering low spirits, “But you _can’t_ marry, you know, while you’re","Great Expectations"
"looking about you.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As we contemplated the fire, and as I thought what a difficult vision","Great Expectations"
"to realise this same Capital sometimes was, I put my hands in my","Great Expectations"
"pockets. A folded piece of paper in one of them attracting my","Great Expectations"
"attention, I opened it and found it to be the play-bill I had received","Great Expectations"
"from Joe, relative to the celebrated provincial amateur of Roscian","Great Expectations"
"renown. “And bless my heart,” I involuntarily added aloud, “it’s","Great Expectations"
"to-night!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"This changed the subject in an instant, and made us hurriedly resolve","Great Expectations"
"to go to the play. So, when I had pledged myself to comfort and abet","Great Expectations"
"Herbert in the affair of his heart by all practicable and impracticable","Great Expectations"
"means, and when Herbert had told me that his affianced already knew me","Great Expectations"
"by reputation and that I should be presented to her, and when we had","Great Expectations"
"warmly shaken hands upon our mutual confidence, we blew out our","Great Expectations"
"candles, made up our fire, locked our door, and issued forth in quest","Great Expectations"
"of Mr. Wopsle and Denmark.","Great Expectations"

"Chapter XXXI.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"On our arrival in Denmark, we found the king and queen of that country","Great Expectations"
"elevated in two arm-chairs on a kitchen-table, holding a Court. The","Great Expectations"
"whole of the Danish nobility were in attendance; consisting of a noble","Great Expectations"
"boy in the wash-leather boots of a gigantic ancestor, a venerable Peer","Great Expectations"
"with a dirty face who seemed to have risen from the people late in","Great Expectations"
"life, and the Danish chivalry with a comb in its hair and a pair of","Great Expectations"
"white silk legs, and presenting on the whole a feminine appearance. My","Great Expectations"
"gifted townsman stood gloomily apart, with folded arms, and I could","Great Expectations"
"have wished that his curls and forehead had been more probable.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Several curious little circumstances transpired as the action","Great Expectations"
"proceeded. The late king of the country not only appeared to have been","Great Expectations"
"troubled with a cough at the time of his decease, but to have taken it","Great Expectations"
"with him to the tomb, and to have brought it back. The royal phantom","Great Expectations"
"also carried a ghostly manuscript round its truncheon, to which it had","Great Expectations"
"the appearance of occasionally referring, and that too, with an air of","Great Expectations"
"anxiety and a tendency to lose the place of reference which were","Great Expectations"
"suggestive of a state of mortality. It was this, I conceive, which led","Great Expectations"
"to the Shade’s being advised by the gallery to “turn over!”—a","Great Expectations"
"recommendation which it took extremely ill. It was likewise to be noted","Great Expectations"
"of this majestic spirit, that whereas it always appeared with an air of","Great Expectations"
"having been out a long time and walked an immense distance, it","Great Expectations"
"perceptibly came from a closely contiguous wall. This occasioned its","Great Expectations"
"terrors to be received derisively. The Queen of Denmark, a very buxom","Great Expectations"
"lady, though no doubt historically brazen, was considered by the public","Great Expectations"
"to have too much brass about her; her chin being attached to her diadem","Great Expectations"
"by a broad band of that metal (as if she had a gorgeous toothache), her","Great Expectations"
"waist being encircled by another, and each of her arms by another, so","Great Expectations"
"that she was openly mentioned as “the kettle-drum.” The noble boy in","Great Expectations"
"the ancestral boots was inconsistent, representing himself, as it were","Great Expectations"
"in one breath, as an able seaman, a strolling actor, a grave-digger, a","Great Expectations"
"clergyman, and a person of the utmost importance at a Court","Great Expectations"
"fencing-match, on the authority of whose practised eye and nice","Great Expectations"
"discrimination the finest strokes were judged. This gradually led to a","Great Expectations"
"want of toleration for him, and even—on his being detected in holy","Great Expectations"
"orders, and declining to perform the funeral service—to the general","Great Expectations"
"indignation taking the form of nuts. Lastly, Ophelia was a prey to such","Great Expectations"
"slow musical madness, that when, in course of time, she had taken off","Great Expectations"
"her white muslin scarf, folded it up, and buried it, a sulky man who","Great Expectations"
"had been long cooling his impatient nose against an iron bar in the","Great Expectations"
"front row of the gallery, growled, “Now the baby’s put to bed let’s","Great Expectations"
"have supper!” Which, to say the least of it, was out of keeping.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Upon my unfortunate townsman all these incidents accumulated with","Great Expectations"
"playful effect. Whenever that undecided Prince had to ask a question or","Great Expectations"
"state a doubt, the public helped him out with it. As for example; on","Great Expectations"
"the question whether ’twas nobler in the mind to suffer, some roared","Great Expectations"
"yes, and some no, and some inclining to both opinions said “Toss up for","Great Expectations"
"it;” and quite a Debating Society arose. When he asked what should such","Great Expectations"
"fellows as he do crawling between earth and heaven, he was encouraged","Great Expectations"
"with loud cries of “Hear, hear!” When he appeared with his stocking","Great Expectations"
"disordered (its disorder expressed, according to usage, by one very","Great Expectations"
"neat fold in the top, which I suppose to be always got up with a flat","Great Expectations"
"iron), a conversation took place in the gallery respecting the paleness","Great Expectations"
"of his leg, and whether it was occasioned by the turn the ghost had","Great Expectations"
"given him. On his taking the recorders,—very like a little black flute","Great Expectations"
"that had just been played in the orchestra and handed out at the","Great Expectations"
"door,—he was called upon unanimously for Rule Britannia. When he","Great Expectations"
"recommended the player not to saw the air thus, the sulky man said,","Great Expectations"
"“And don’t _you_ do it, neither; you’re a deal worse than _him_!” And I","Great Expectations"
"grieve to add that peals of laughter greeted Mr. Wopsle on every one of","Great Expectations"
"these occasions.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"But his greatest trials were in the churchyard, which had the","Great Expectations"
"appearance of a primeval forest, with a kind of small ecclesiastical","Great Expectations"
"wash-house on one side, and a turnpike gate on the other. Mr. Wopsle in","Great Expectations"
"a comprehensive black cloak, being descried entering at the turnpike,","Great Expectations"
"the gravedigger was admonished in a friendly way, “Look out! Here’s the","Great Expectations"
"undertaker a coming, to see how you’re a getting on with your work!” I","Great Expectations"
"believe it is well known in a constitutional country that Mr. Wopsle","Great Expectations"
"could not possibly have returned the skull, after moralizing over it,","Great Expectations"
"without dusting his fingers on a white napkin taken from his breast;","Great Expectations"
"but even that innocent and indispensable action did not pass without","Great Expectations"
"the comment, “Wai-ter!” The arrival of the body for interment (in an","Great Expectations"
"empty black box with the lid tumbling open), was the signal for a","Great Expectations"
"general joy, which was much enhanced by the discovery, among the","Great Expectations"
"bearers, of an individual obnoxious to identification. The joy attended","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Wopsle through his struggle with Laertes on the brink of the","Great Expectations"
"orchestra and the grave, and slackened no more until he had tumbled the","Great Expectations"
"king off the kitchen-table, and had died by inches from the ankles","Great Expectations"
"upward.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We had made some pale efforts in the beginning to applaud Mr. Wopsle;","Great Expectations"
"but they were too hopeless to be persisted in. Therefore we had sat,","Great Expectations"
"feeling keenly for him, but laughing, nevertheless, from ear to ear. I","Great Expectations"
"laughed in spite of myself all the time, the whole thing was so droll;","Great Expectations"
"and yet I had a latent impression that there was something decidedly","Great Expectations"
"fine in Mr. Wopsle’s elocution,—not for old associations’ sake, I am","Great Expectations"
"afraid, but because it was very slow, very dreary, very uphill and","Great Expectations"
"downhill, and very unlike any way in which any man in any natural","Great Expectations"
"circumstances of life or death ever expressed himself about anything.","Great Expectations"
"When the tragedy was over, and he had been called for and hooted, I","Great Expectations"
"said to Herbert, “Let us go at once, or perhaps we shall meet him.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We made all the haste we could downstairs, but we were not quick enough","Great Expectations"
"either. Standing at the door was a Jewish man with an unnatural heavy","Great Expectations"
"smear of eyebrow, who caught my eyes as we advanced, and said, when we","Great Expectations"
"came up with him,—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Mr. Pip and friend?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Identity of Mr. Pip and friend confessed.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Mr. Waldengarver,” said the man, “would be glad to have the honour.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Waldengarver?” I repeated—when Herbert murmured in my ear, “Probably","Great Expectations"
"Wopsle.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Oh!” said I. “Yes. Shall we follow you?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“A few steps, please.” When we were in a side alley, he turned and","Great Expectations"
"asked, “How did you think he looked?—I dressed him.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I don’t know what he had looked like, except a funeral; with the","Great Expectations"
"addition of a large Danish sun or star hanging round his neck by a blue","Great Expectations"
"ribbon, that had given him the appearance of being insured in some","Great Expectations"
"extraordinary Fire Office. But I said he had looked very nice.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“When he come to the grave,” said our conductor, “he showed his cloak","Great Expectations"
"beautiful. But, judging from the wing, it looked to me that when he see","Great Expectations"
"the ghost in the queen’s apartment, he might have made more of his","Great Expectations"
"stockings.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I modestly assented, and we all fell through a little dirty swing door,","Great Expectations"
"into a sort of hot packing-case immediately behind it. Here Mr. Wopsle","Great Expectations"
"was divesting himself of his Danish garments, and here there was just","Great Expectations"
"room for us to look at him over one another’s shoulders, by keeping the","Great Expectations"
"packing-case door, or lid, wide open.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Gentlemen,” said Mr. Wopsle, “I am proud to see you. I hope, Mr. Pip,","Great Expectations"
"you will excuse my sending round. I had the happiness to know you in","Great Expectations"
"former times, and the Drama has ever had a claim which has ever been","Great Expectations"
"acknowledged, on the noble and the affluent.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Meanwhile, Mr. Waldengarver, in a frightful perspiration, was trying to","Great Expectations"
"get himself out of his princely sables.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Skin the stockings off Mr. Waldengarver,” said the owner of that","Great Expectations"
"property, “or you’ll bust ’em. Bust ’em, and you’ll bust","Great Expectations"
"five-and-thirty shillings. Shakspeare never was complimented with a","Great Expectations"
"finer pair. Keep quiet in your chair now, and leave ’em to me.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"With that, he went upon his knees, and began to flay his victim; who,","Great Expectations"
"on the first stocking coming off, would certainly have fallen over","Great Expectations"
"backward with his chair, but for there being no room to fall anyhow.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I had been afraid until then to say a word about the play. But then,","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Waldengarver looked up at us complacently, and said,—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Gentlemen, how did it seem to you, to go, in front?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Herbert said from behind (at the same time poking me), “Capitally.” So","Great Expectations"
"I said “Capitally.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“How did you like my reading of the character, gentlemen?” said Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Waldengarver, almost, if not quite, with patronage.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Herbert said from behind (again poking me), “Massive and concrete.” So","Great Expectations"
"I said boldly, as if I had originated it, and must beg to insist upon","Great Expectations"
"it, “Massive and concrete.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I am glad to have your approbation, gentlemen,” said Mr. Waldengarver,","Great Expectations"
"with an air of dignity, in spite of his being ground against the wall","Great Expectations"
"at the time, and holding on by the seat of the chair.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“But I’ll tell you one thing, Mr. Waldengarver,” said the man who was","Great Expectations"
"on his knees, “in which you’re out in your reading. Now mind! I don’t","Great Expectations"
"care who says contrairy; I tell you so. You’re out in your reading of","Great Expectations"
"Hamlet when you get your legs in profile. The last Hamlet as I dressed,","Great Expectations"
"made the same mistakes in his reading at rehearsal, till I got him to","Great Expectations"
"put a large red wafer on each of his shins, and then at that rehearsal","Great Expectations"
"(which was the last) I went in front, sir, to the back of the pit, and","Great Expectations"
"whenever his reading brought him into profile, I called out “I don’t","Great Expectations"
"see no wafers!” And at night his reading was lovely.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Waldengarver smiled at me, as much as to say “a faithful","Great Expectations"
"Dependent—I overlook his folly;” and then said aloud, “My view is a","Great Expectations"
"little classic and thoughtful for them here; but they will improve,","Great Expectations"
"they will improve.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Herbert and I said together, O, no doubt they would improve.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Did you observe, gentlemen,” said Mr. Waldengarver, “that there was a","Great Expectations"
"man in the gallery who endeavoured to cast derision on the service,—I","Great Expectations"
"mean, the representation?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We basely replied that we rather thought we had noticed such a man. I","Great Expectations"
"added, “He was drunk, no doubt.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“O dear no, sir,” said Mr. Wopsle, “not drunk. His employer would see","Great Expectations"
"to that, sir. His employer would not allow him to be drunk.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You know his employer?” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Wopsle shut his eyes, and opened them again; performing both","Great Expectations"
"ceremonies very slowly. “You must have observed, gentlemen,” said he,","Great Expectations"
"“an ignorant and a blatant ass, with a rasping throat and a countenance","Great Expectations"
"expressive of low malignity, who went through—I will not say","Great Expectations"
"sustained—the rôle (if I may use a French expression) of Claudius, King","Great Expectations"
"of Denmark. That is his employer, gentlemen. Such is the profession!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Without distinctly knowing whether I should have been more sorry for","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Wopsle if he had been in despair, I was so sorry for him as it was,","Great Expectations"
"that I took the opportunity of his turning round to have his braces put","Great Expectations"
"on,—which jostled us out at the doorway,—to ask Herbert what he thought","Great Expectations"
"of having him home to supper? Herbert said he thought it would be kind","Great Expectations"
"to do so; therefore I invited him, and he went to Barnard’s with us,","Great Expectations"
"wrapped up to the eyes, and we did our best for him, and he sat until","Great Expectations"
"two o’clock in the morning, reviewing his success and developing his","Great Expectations"
"plans. I forget in detail what they were, but I have a general","Great Expectations"
"recollection that he was to begin with reviving the Drama, and to end","Great Expectations"
"with crushing it; inasmuch as his decease would leave it utterly bereft","Great Expectations"
"and without a chance or hope.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Miserably I went to bed after all, and miserably thought of Estella,","Great Expectations"
"and miserably dreamed that my expectations were all cancelled, and that","Great Expectations"
"I had to give my hand in marriage to Herbert’s Clara, or play Hamlet to","Great Expectations"
"Miss Havisham’s Ghost, before twenty thousand people, without knowing","Great Expectations"
"twenty words of it.","Great Expectations"

"Chapter XXXII.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"One day when I was busy with my books and Mr. Pocket, I received a note","Great Expectations"
"by the post, the mere outside of which threw me into a great flutter;","Great Expectations"
"for, though I had never seen the handwriting in which it was addressed,","Great Expectations"
"I divined whose hand it was. It had no set beginning, as Dear Mr. Pip,","Great Expectations"
"or Dear Pip, or Dear Sir, or Dear Anything, but ran thus:—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I am to come to London the day after to-morrow by the midday coach. I","Great Expectations"
"believe it was settled you should meet me? At all events Miss Havisham","Great Expectations"
"has that impression, and I write in obedience to it. She sends you her","Great Expectations"
"regard.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yours, ESTELLA.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"If there had been time, I should probably have ordered several suits of","Great Expectations"
"clothes for this occasion; but as there was not, I was fain to be","Great Expectations"
"content with those I had. My appetite vanished instantly, and I knew no","Great Expectations"
"peace or rest until the day arrived. Not that its arrival brought me","Great Expectations"
"either; for, then I was worse than ever, and began haunting the","Great Expectations"
"coach-office in Wood Street, Cheapside, before the coach had left the","Great Expectations"
"Blue Boar in our town. For all that I knew this perfectly well, I still","Great Expectations"
"felt as if it were not safe to let the coach-office be out of my sight","Great Expectations"
"longer than five minutes at a time; and in this condition of unreason I","Great Expectations"
"had performed the first half-hour of a watch of four or five hours,","Great Expectations"
"when Wemmick ran against me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Halloa, Mr. Pip,” said he; “how do you do? I should hardly have","Great Expectations"
"thought this was _your_ beat.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I explained that I was waiting to meet somebody who was coming up by","Great Expectations"
"coach, and I inquired after the Castle and the Aged.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Both flourishing thankye,” said Wemmick, “and particularly the Aged.","Great Expectations"
"He’s in wonderful feather. He’ll be eighty-two next birthday. I have a","Great Expectations"
"notion of firing eighty-two times, if the neighbourhood shouldn’t","Great Expectations"
"complain, and that cannon of mine should prove equal to the pressure.","Great Expectations"
"However, this is not London talk. Where do you think I am going to?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“To the office?” said I, for he was tending in that direction.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Next thing to it,” returned Wemmick, “I am going to Newgate. We are in","Great Expectations"
"a banker’s-parcel case just at present, and I have been down the road","Great Expectations"
"taking a squint at the scene of action, and thereupon must have a word","Great Expectations"
"or two with our client.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Did your client commit the robbery?” I asked.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Bless your soul and body, no,” answered Wemmick, very drily. “But he","Great Expectations"
"is accused of it. So might you or I be. Either of us might be accused","Great Expectations"
"of it, you know.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Only neither of us is,” I remarked.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yah!” said Wemmick, touching me on the breast with his forefinger;","Great Expectations"
"“you’re a deep one, Mr. Pip! Would you like to have a look at Newgate?","Great Expectations"
"Have you time to spare?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I had so much time to spare, that the proposal came as a relief,","Great Expectations"
"notwithstanding its irreconcilability with my latent desire to keep my","Great Expectations"
"eye on the coach-office. Muttering that I would make the inquiry","Great Expectations"
"whether I had time to walk with him, I went into the office, and","Great Expectations"
"ascertained from the clerk with the nicest precision and much to the","Great Expectations"
"trying of his temper, the earliest moment at which the coach could be","Great Expectations"
"expected,—which I knew beforehand, quite as well as he. I then rejoined","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Wemmick, and affecting to consult my watch, and to be surprised by","Great Expectations"
"the information I had received, accepted his offer.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We were at Newgate in a few minutes, and we passed through the lodge","Great Expectations"
"where some fetters were hanging up on the bare walls among the prison","Great Expectations"
"rules, into the interior of the jail. At that time jails were much","Great Expectations"
"neglected, and the period of exaggerated reaction consequent on all","Great Expectations"
"public wrongdoing—and which is always its heaviest and longest","Great Expectations"
"punishment—was still far off. So, felons were not lodged and fed better","Great Expectations"
"than soldiers (to say nothing of paupers), and seldom set fire to their","Great Expectations"
"prisons with the excusable object of improving the flavour of their","Great Expectations"
"soup. It was visiting time when Wemmick took me in, and a potman was","Great Expectations"
"going his rounds with beer; and the prisoners, behind bars in yards,","Great Expectations"
"were buying beer, and talking to friends; and a frowzy, ugly,","Great Expectations"
"disorderly, depressing scene it was.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It struck me that Wemmick walked among the prisoners much as a gardener","Great Expectations"
"might walk among his plants. This was first put into my head by his","Great Expectations"
"seeing a shoot that had come up in the night, and saying, “What,","Great Expectations"
"Captain Tom? Are _you_ there? Ah, indeed!” and also, “Is that Black","Great Expectations"
"Bill behind the cistern? Why I didn’t look for you these two months;","Great Expectations"
"how do you find yourself?” Equally in his stopping at the bars and","Great Expectations"
"attending to anxious whisperers,—always singly,—Wemmick with his","Great Expectations"
"post-office in an immovable state, looked at them while in conference,","Great Expectations"
"as if he were taking particular notice of the advance they had made,","Great Expectations"
"since last observed, towards coming out in full blow at their trial.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He was highly popular, and I found that he took the familiar department","Great Expectations"
"of Mr. Jaggers’s business; though something of the state of Mr. Jaggers","Great Expectations"
"hung about him too, forbidding approach beyond certain limits. His","Great Expectations"
"personal recognition of each successive client was comprised in a nod,","Great Expectations"
"and in his settling his hat a little easier on his head with both","Great Expectations"
"hands, and then tightening the post-office, and putting his hands in","Great Expectations"
"his pockets. In one or two instances there was a difficulty respecting","Great Expectations"
"the raising of fees, and then Mr. Wemmick, backing as far as possible","Great Expectations"
"from the insufficient money produced, said, “it’s no use, my boy. I’m","Great Expectations"
"only a subordinate. I can’t take it. Don’t go on in that way with a","Great Expectations"
"subordinate. If you are unable to make up your quantum, my boy, you had","Great Expectations"
"better address yourself to a principal; there are plenty of principals","Great Expectations"
"in the profession, you know, and what is not worth the while of one,","Great Expectations"
"may be worth the while of another; that’s my recommendation to you,","Great Expectations"
"speaking as a subordinate. Don’t try on useless measures. Why should","Great Expectations"
"you? Now, who’s next?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Thus, we walked through Wemmick’s greenhouse, until he turned to me and","Great Expectations"
"said, “Notice the man I shall shake hands with.” I should have done so,","Great Expectations"
"without the preparation, as he had shaken hands with no one yet.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Almost as soon as he had spoken, a portly upright man (whom I can see","Great Expectations"
"now, as I write) in a well-worn olive-coloured frock-coat, with a","Great Expectations"
"peculiar pallor overspreading the red in his complexion, and eyes that","Great Expectations"
"went wandering about when he tried to fix them, came up to a corner of","Great Expectations"
"the bars, and put his hand to his hat—which had a greasy and fatty","Great Expectations"
"surface like cold broth—with a half-serious and half-jocose military","Great Expectations"
"salute.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Colonel, to you!” said Wemmick; “how are you, Colonel?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“All right, Mr. Wemmick.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Everything was done that could be done, but the evidence was too","Great Expectations"
"strong for us, Colonel.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, it was too strong, sir,—but _I_ don’t care.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No, no,” said Wemmick, coolly, “_you_ don’t care.” Then, turning to","Great Expectations"
"me, “Served His Majesty this man. Was a soldier in the line and bought","Great Expectations"
"his discharge.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I said, “Indeed?” and the man’s eyes looked at me, and then looked over","Great Expectations"
"my head, and then looked all round me, and then he drew his hand across","Great Expectations"
"his lips and laughed.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I think I shall be out of this on Monday, sir,” he said to Wemmick.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Perhaps,” returned my friend, “but there’s no knowing.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I am glad to have the chance of bidding you good-bye, Mr. Wemmick,”","Great Expectations"
"said the man, stretching out his hand between two bars.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Thankye,” said Wemmick, shaking hands with him. “Same to you,","Great Expectations"
"Colonel.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“If what I had upon me when taken had been real, Mr. Wemmick,” said the","Great Expectations"
"man, unwilling to let his hand go, “I should have asked the favour of","Great Expectations"
"your wearing another ring—in acknowledgment of your attentions.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I’ll accept the will for the deed,” said Wemmick. “By the by; you were","Great Expectations"
"quite a pigeon-fancier.” The man looked up at the sky. “I am told you","Great Expectations"
"had a remarkable breed of tumblers. _Could_ you commission any friend","Great Expectations"
"of yours to bring me a pair, if you’ve no further use for ’em?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It shall be done, sir.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“All right,” said Wemmick, “they shall be taken care of.","Great Expectations"
"Good-afternoon, Colonel. Good-bye!” They shook hands again, and as we","Great Expectations"
"walked away Wemmick said to me, “A Coiner, a very good workman. The","Great Expectations"
"Recorder’s report is made to-day, and he is sure to be executed on","Great Expectations"
"Monday. Still you see, as far as it goes, a pair of pigeons are","Great Expectations"
"portable property all the same.” With that, he looked back, and nodded","Great Expectations"
"at this dead plant, and then cast his eyes about him in walking out of","Great Expectations"
"the yard, as if he were considering what other pot would go best in its","Great Expectations"
"place.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As we came out of the prison through the lodge, I found that the great","Great Expectations"
"importance of my guardian was appreciated by the turnkeys, no less than","Great Expectations"
"by those whom they held in charge. “Well, Mr. Wemmick,” said the","Great Expectations"
"turnkey, who kept us between the two studded and spiked lodge gates,","Great Expectations"
"and who carefully locked one before he unlocked the other, “what’s Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Jaggers going to do with that water-side murder? Is he going to make it","Great Expectations"
"manslaughter, or what’s he going to make of it?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Why don’t you ask him?” returned Wemmick.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“O yes, I dare say!” said the turnkey.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Now, that’s the way with them here, Mr. Pip,” remarked Wemmick,","Great Expectations"
"turning to me with his post-office elongated. “They don’t mind what","Great Expectations"
"they ask of me, the subordinate; but you’ll never catch ’em asking any","Great Expectations"
"questions of my principal.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Is this young gentleman one of the ’prentices or articled ones of your","Great Expectations"
"office?” asked the turnkey, with a grin at Mr. Wemmick’s humour.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“There he goes again, you see!” cried Wemmick, “I told you so! Asks","Great Expectations"
"another question of the subordinate before his first is dry! Well,","Great Expectations"
"supposing Mr. Pip is one of them?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Why then,” said the turnkey, grinning again, “he knows what Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Jaggers is.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yah!” cried Wemmick, suddenly hitting out at the turnkey in a","Great Expectations"
"facetious way, “you’re dumb as one of your own keys when you have to do","Great Expectations"
"with my principal, you know you are. Let us out, you old fox, or I’ll","Great Expectations"
"get him to bring an action against you for false imprisonment.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The turnkey laughed, and gave us good day, and stood laughing at us","Great Expectations"
"over the spikes of the wicket when we descended the steps into the","Great Expectations"
"street.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Mind you, Mr. Pip,” said Wemmick, gravely in my ear, as he took my arm","Great Expectations"
"to be more confidential; “I don’t know that Mr. Jaggers does a better","Great Expectations"
"thing than the way in which he keeps himself so high. He’s always so","Great Expectations"
"high. His constant height is of a piece with his immense abilities.","Great Expectations"
"That Colonel durst no more take leave of _him_, than that turnkey durst","Great Expectations"
"ask him his intentions respecting a case. Then, between his height and","Great Expectations"
"them, he slips in his subordinate,—don’t you see?—and so he has ’em,","Great Expectations"
"soul and body.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I was very much impressed, and not for the first time, by my guardian’s","Great Expectations"
"subtlety. To confess the truth, I very heartily wished, and not for the","Great Expectations"
"first time, that I had had some other guardian of minor abilities.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Wemmick and I parted at the office in Little Britain, where","Great Expectations"
"suppliants for Mr. Jaggers’s notice were lingering about as usual, and","Great Expectations"
"I returned to my watch in the street of the coach-office, with some","Great Expectations"
"three hours on hand. I consumed the whole time in thinking how strange","Great Expectations"
"it was that I should be encompassed by all this taint of prison and","Great Expectations"
"crime; that, in my childhood out on our lonely marshes on a winter","Great Expectations"
"evening, I should have first encountered it; that, it should have","Great Expectations"
"reappeared on two occasions, starting out like a stain that was faded","Great Expectations"
"but not gone; that, it should in this new way pervade my fortune and","Great Expectations"
"advancement. While my mind was thus engaged, I thought of the beautiful","Great Expectations"
"young Estella, proud and refined, coming towards me, and I thought with","Great Expectations"
"absolute abhorrence of the contrast between the jail and her. I wished","Great Expectations"
"that Wemmick had not met me, or that I had not yielded to him and gone","Great Expectations"
"with him, so that, of all days in the year on this day, I might not","Great Expectations"
"have had Newgate in my breath and on my clothes. I beat the prison dust","Great Expectations"
"off my feet as I sauntered to and fro, and I shook it out of my dress,","Great Expectations"
"and I exhaled its air from my lungs. So contaminated did I feel,","Great Expectations"
"remembering who was coming, that the coach came quickly after all, and","Great Expectations"
"I was not yet free from the soiling consciousness of Mr. Wemmick’s","Great Expectations"
"conservatory, when I saw her face at the coach window and her hand","Great Expectations"
"waving to me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"What _was_ the nameless shadow which again in that one instant had","Great Expectations"
"passed?","Great Expectations"

"Chapter XXXIII.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"In her furred travelling-dress, Estella seemed more delicately","Great Expectations"
"beautiful than she had ever seemed yet, even in my eyes. Her manner was","Great Expectations"
"more winning than she had cared to let it be to me before, and I","Great Expectations"
"thought I saw Miss Havisham’s influence in the change.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We stood in the Inn Yard while she pointed out her luggage to me, and","Great Expectations"
"when it was all collected I remembered—having forgotten everything but","Great Expectations"
"herself in the meanwhile—that I knew nothing of her destination.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I am going to Richmond,” she told me. “Our lesson is, that there are","Great Expectations"
"two Richmonds, one in Surrey and one in Yorkshire, and that mine is the","Great Expectations"
"Surrey Richmond. The distance is ten miles. I am to have a carriage,","Great Expectations"
"and you are to take me. This is my purse, and you are to pay my charges","Great Expectations"
"out of it. O, you must take the purse! We have no choice, you and I,","Great Expectations"
"but to obey our instructions. We are not free to follow our own","Great Expectations"
"devices, you and I.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As she looked at me in giving me the purse, I hoped there was an inner","Great Expectations"
"meaning in her words. She said them slightingly, but not with","Great Expectations"
"displeasure.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“A carriage will have to be sent for, Estella. Will you rest here a","Great Expectations"
"little?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, I am to rest here a little, and I am to drink some tea, and you","Great Expectations"
"are to take care of me the while.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"She drew her arm through mine, as if it must be done, and I requested a","Great Expectations"
"waiter who had been staring at the coach like a man who had never seen","Great Expectations"
"such a thing in his life, to show us a private sitting-room. Upon that,","Great Expectations"
"he pulled out a napkin, as if it were a magic clue without which he","Great Expectations"
"couldn’t find the way upstairs, and led us to the black hole of the","Great Expectations"
"establishment, fitted up with a diminishing mirror (quite a superfluous","Great Expectations"
"article, considering the hole’s proportions), an anchovy sauce-cruet,","Great Expectations"
"and somebody’s pattens. On my objecting to this retreat, he took us","Great Expectations"
"into another room with a dinner-table for thirty, and in the grate a","Great Expectations"
"scorched leaf of a copy-book under a bushel of coal-dust. Having looked","Great Expectations"
"at this extinct conflagration and shaken his head, he took my order;","Great Expectations"
"which, proving to be merely, “Some tea for the lady,” sent him out of","Great Expectations"
"the room in a very low state of mind.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I was, and I am, sensible that the air of this chamber, in its strong","Great Expectations"
"combination of stable with soup-stock, might have led one to infer that","Great Expectations"
"the coaching department was not doing well, and that the enterprising","Great Expectations"
"proprietor was boiling down the horses for the refreshment department.","Great Expectations"
"Yet the room was all in all to me, Estella being in it. I thought that","Great Expectations"
"with her I could have been happy there for life. (I was not at all","Great Expectations"
"happy there at the time, observe, and I knew it well.)","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Where are you going to, at Richmond?” I asked Estella.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I am going to live,” said she, “at a great expense, with a lady there,","Great Expectations"
"who has the power—or says she has—of taking me about, and introducing","Great Expectations"
"me, and showing people to me and showing me to people.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I suppose you will be glad of variety and admiration?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, I suppose so.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"She answered so carelessly, that I said, “You speak of yourself as if","Great Expectations"
"you were some one else.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Where did you learn how I speak of others? Come, come,” said Estella,","Great Expectations"
"smiling delightfully, “you must not expect me to go to school to _you_;","Great Expectations"
"I must talk in my own way. How do you thrive with Mr. Pocket?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I live quite pleasantly there; at least—” It appeared to me that I was","Great Expectations"
"losing a chance.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“At least?” repeated Estella.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“As pleasantly as I could anywhere, away from you.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You silly boy,” said Estella, quite composedly, “how can you talk such","Great Expectations"
"nonsense? Your friend Mr. Matthew, I believe, is superior to the rest","Great Expectations"
"of his family?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Very superior indeed. He is nobody’s enemy—”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Don’t add but his own,” interposed Estella, “for I hate that class of","Great Expectations"
"man. But he really is disinterested, and above small jealousy and","Great Expectations"
"spite, I have heard?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I am sure I have every reason to say so.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You have not every reason to say so of the rest of his people,” said","Great Expectations"
"Estella, nodding at me with an expression of face that was at once","Great Expectations"
"grave and rallying, “for they beset Miss Havisham with reports and","Great Expectations"
"insinuations to your disadvantage. They watch you, misrepresent you,","Great Expectations"
"write letters about you (anonymous sometimes), and you are the torment","Great Expectations"
"and the occupation of their lives. You can scarcely realise to yourself","Great Expectations"
"the hatred those people feel for you.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“They do me no harm, I hope?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Instead of answering, Estella burst out laughing. This was very","Great Expectations"
"singular to me, and I looked at her in considerable perplexity. When","Great Expectations"
"she left off—and she had not laughed languidly, but with real","Great Expectations"
"enjoyment—I said, in my diffident way with her,—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I hope I may suppose that you would not be amused if they did me any","Great Expectations"
"harm.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No, no you may be sure of that,” said Estella. “You may be certain","Great Expectations"
"that I laugh because they fail. O, those people with Miss Havisham, and","Great Expectations"
"the tortures they undergo!” She laughed again, and even now when she","Great Expectations"
"had told me why, her laughter was very singular to me, for I could not","Great Expectations"
"doubt its being genuine, and yet it seemed too much for the occasion. I","Great Expectations"
"thought there must really be something more here than I knew; she saw","Great Expectations"
"the thought in my mind, and answered it.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It is not easy for even you.” said Estella, “to know what satisfaction","Great Expectations"
"it gives me to see those people thwarted, or what an enjoyable sense of","Great Expectations"
"the ridiculous I have when they are made ridiculous. For you were not","Great Expectations"
"brought up in that strange house from a mere baby. I was. You had not","Great Expectations"
"your little wits sharpened by their intriguing against you, suppressed","Great Expectations"
"and defenceless, under the mask of sympathy and pity and what not that","Great Expectations"
"is soft and soothing. I had. You did not gradually open your round","Great Expectations"
"childish eyes wider and wider to the discovery of that impostor of a","Great Expectations"
"woman who calculates her stores of peace of mind for when she wakes up","Great Expectations"
"in the night. I did.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was no laughing matter with Estella now, nor was she summoning these","Great Expectations"
"remembrances from any shallow place. I would not have been the cause of","Great Expectations"
"that look of hers for all my expectations in a heap.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Two things I can tell you,” said Estella. “First, notwithstanding the","Great Expectations"
"proverb that constant dropping will wear away a stone, you may set your","Great Expectations"
"mind at rest that these people never will—never would in a hundred","Great Expectations"
"years—impair your ground with Miss Havisham, in any particular, great","Great Expectations"
"or small. Second, I am beholden to you as the cause of their being so","Great Expectations"
"busy and so mean in vain, and there is my hand upon it.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As she gave it to me playfully,—for her darker mood had been but","Great Expectations"
"momentary—I held it and put it to my lips. “You ridiculous boy,” said","Great Expectations"
"Estella, “will you never take warning? Or do you kiss my hand in the","Great Expectations"
"same spirit in which I once let you kiss my cheek?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What spirit was that?” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I must think a moment. A spirit of contempt for the fawners and","Great Expectations"
"plotters.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“If I say yes, may I kiss the cheek again?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You should have asked before you touched the hand. But, yes, if you","Great Expectations"
"like.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I leaned down, and her calm face was like a statue’s. “Now,” said","Great Expectations"
"Estella, gliding away the instant I touched her cheek, “you are to take","Great Expectations"
"care that I have some tea, and you are to take me to Richmond.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Her reverting to this tone as if our association were forced upon us,","Great Expectations"
"and we were mere puppets, gave me pain; but everything in our","Great Expectations"
"intercourse did give me pain. Whatever her tone with me happened to be,","Great Expectations"
"I could put no trust in it, and build no hope on it; and yet I went on","Great Expectations"
"against trust and against hope. Why repeat it a thousand times? So it","Great Expectations"
"always was.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I rang for the tea, and the waiter, reappearing with his magic clue,","Great Expectations"
"brought in by degrees some fifty adjuncts to that refreshment, but of","Great Expectations"
"tea not a glimpse. A teaboard, cups and saucers, plates, knives and","Great Expectations"
"forks (including carvers), spoons (various), salt-cellars, a meek","Great Expectations"
"little muffin confined with the utmost precaution under a strong iron","Great Expectations"
"cover, Moses in the bulrushes typified by a soft bit of butter in a","Great Expectations"
"quantity of parsley, a pale loaf with a powdered head, two proof","Great Expectations"
"impressions of the bars of the kitchen fireplace on triangular bits of","Great Expectations"
"bread, and ultimately a fat family urn; which the waiter staggered in","Great Expectations"
"with, expressing in his countenance burden and suffering. After a","Great Expectations"
"prolonged absence at this stage of the entertainment, he at length came","Great Expectations"
"back with a casket of precious appearance containing twigs. These I","Great Expectations"
"steeped in hot water, and so from the whole of these appliances","Great Expectations"
"extracted one cup of I don’t know what for Estella.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The bill paid, and the waiter remembered, and the ostler not forgotten,","Great Expectations"
"and the chambermaid taken into consideration,—in a word, the whole","Great Expectations"
"house bribed into a state of contempt and animosity, and Estella’s","Great Expectations"
"purse much lightened,—we got into our post-coach and drove away.","Great Expectations"
"Turning into Cheapside and rattling up Newgate Street, we were soon","Great Expectations"
"under the walls of which I was so ashamed.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What place is that?” Estella asked me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I made a foolish pretence of not at first recognising it, and then told","Great Expectations"
"her. As she looked at it, and drew in her head again, murmuring,","Great Expectations"
"“Wretches!” I would not have confessed to my visit for any","Great Expectations"
"consideration.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Mr. Jaggers,” said I, by way of putting it neatly on somebody else,","Great Expectations"
"“has the reputation of being more in the secrets of that dismal place","Great Expectations"
"than any man in London.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“He is more in the secrets of every place, I think,” said Estella, in a","Great Expectations"
"low voice.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You have been accustomed to see him often, I suppose?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I have been accustomed to see him at uncertain intervals, ever since I","Great Expectations"
"can remember. But I know him no better now, than I did before I could","Great Expectations"
"speak plainly. What is your own experience of him? Do you advance with","Great Expectations"
"him?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Once habituated to his distrustful manner,” said I, “I have done very","Great Expectations"
"well.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Are you intimate?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I have dined with him at his private house.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I fancy,” said Estella, shrinking “that must be a curious place.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It is a curious place.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I should have been chary of discussing my guardian too freely even with","Great Expectations"
"her; but I should have gone on with the subject so far as to describe","Great Expectations"
"the dinner in Gerrard Street, if we had not then come into a sudden","Great Expectations"
"glare of gas. It seemed, while it lasted, to be all alight and alive","Great Expectations"
"with that inexplicable feeling I had had before; and when we were out","Great Expectations"
"of it, I was as much dazed for a few moments as if I had been in","Great Expectations"
"lightning.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"So we fell into other talk, and it was principally about the way by","Great Expectations"
"which we were travelling, and about what parts of London lay on this","Great Expectations"
"side of it, and what on that. The great city was almost new to her, she","Great Expectations"
"told me, for she had never left Miss Havisham’s neighbourhood until she","Great Expectations"
"had gone to France, and she had merely passed through London then in","Great Expectations"
"going and returning. I asked her if my guardian had any charge of her","Great Expectations"
"while she remained here? To that she emphatically said “God forbid!”","Great Expectations"
"and no more.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was impossible for me to avoid seeing that she cared to attract me;","Great Expectations"
"that she made herself winning, and would have won me even if the task","Great Expectations"
"had needed pains. Yet this made me none the happier, for even if she","Great Expectations"
"had not taken that tone of our being disposed of by others, I should","Great Expectations"
"have felt that she held my heart in her hand because she wilfully chose","Great Expectations"
"to do it, and not because it would have wrung any tenderness in her to","Great Expectations"
"crush it and throw it away.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"When we passed through Hammersmith, I showed her where Mr. Matthew","Great Expectations"
"Pocket lived, and said it was no great way from Richmond, and that I","Great Expectations"
"hoped I should see her sometimes.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“O yes, you are to see me; you are to come when you think proper; you","Great Expectations"
"are to be mentioned to the family; indeed you are already mentioned.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I inquired was it a large household she was going to be a member of?","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No; there are only two; mother and daughter. The mother is a lady of","Great Expectations"
"some station, though not averse to increasing her income.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I wonder Miss Havisham could part with you again so soon.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It is a part of Miss Havisham’s plans for me, Pip,” said Estella, with","Great Expectations"
"a sigh, as if she were tired; “I am to write to her constantly and see","Great Expectations"
"her regularly and report how I go on,—I and the jewels,—for they are","Great Expectations"
"nearly all mine now.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was the first time she had ever called me by my name. Of course she","Great Expectations"
"did so purposely, and knew that I should treasure it up.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We came to Richmond all too soon, and our destination there was a house","Great Expectations"
"by the green,—a staid old house, where hoops and powder and patches,","Great Expectations"
"embroidered coats, rolled stockings, ruffles and swords, had had their","Great Expectations"
"court days many a time. Some ancient trees before the house were still","Great Expectations"
"cut into fashions as formal and unnatural as the hoops and wigs and","Great Expectations"
"stiff skirts; but their own allotted places in the great procession of","Great Expectations"
"the dead were not far off, and they would soon drop into them and go","Great Expectations"
"the silent way of the rest.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"A bell with an old voice—which I dare say in its time had often said to","Great Expectations"
"the house, Here is the green farthingale, Here is the diamond-hilted","Great Expectations"
"sword, Here are the shoes with red heels and the blue solitaire—sounded","Great Expectations"
"gravely in the moonlight, and two cherry-coloured maids came fluttering","Great Expectations"
"out to receive Estella. The doorway soon absorbed her boxes, and she","Great Expectations"
"gave me her hand and a smile, and said good-night, and was absorbed","Great Expectations"
"likewise. And still I stood looking at the house, thinking how happy I","Great Expectations"
"should be if I lived there with her, and knowing that I never was happy","Great Expectations"
"with her, but always miserable.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I got into the carriage to be taken back to Hammersmith, and I got in","Great Expectations"
"with a bad heart-ache, and I got out with a worse heart-ache. At our","Great Expectations"
"own door, I found little Jane Pocket coming home from a little party","Great Expectations"
"escorted by her little lover; and I envied her little lover, in spite","Great Expectations"
"of his being subject to Flopson.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Pocket was out lecturing; for, he was a most delightful lecturer on","Great Expectations"
"domestic economy, and his treatises on the management of children and","Great Expectations"
"servants were considered the very best text-books on those themes. But","Great Expectations"
"Mrs. Pocket was at home, and was in a little difficulty, on account of","Great Expectations"
"the baby’s having been accommodated with a needle-case to keep him","Great Expectations"
"quiet during the unaccountable absence (with a relative in the Foot","Great Expectations"
"Guards) of Millers. And more needles were missing than it could be","Great Expectations"
"regarded as quite wholesome for a patient of such tender years either","Great Expectations"
"to apply externally or to take as a tonic.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Pocket being justly celebrated for giving most excellent practical","Great Expectations"
"advice, and for having a clear and sound perception of things and a","Great Expectations"
"highly judicious mind, I had some notion in my heart-ache of begging","Great Expectations"
"him to accept my confidence. But happening to look up at Mrs. Pocket as","Great Expectations"
"she sat reading her book of dignities after prescribing Bed as a","Great Expectations"
"sovereign remedy for baby, I thought—Well—No, I wouldn’t.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"

"","Great Expectations"
"Chapter XXXIV.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As I had grown accustomed to my expectations, I had insensibly begun to","Great Expectations"
"notice their effect upon myself and those around me. Their influence on","Great Expectations"
"my own character I disguised from my recognition as much as possible,","Great Expectations"
"but I knew very well that it was not all good. I lived in a state of","Great Expectations"
"chronic uneasiness respecting my behaviour to Joe. My conscience was","Great Expectations"
"not by any means comfortable about Biddy. When I woke up in the","Great Expectations"
"night,—like Camilla,—I used to think, with a weariness on my spirits,","Great Expectations"
"that I should have been happier and better if I had never seen Miss","Great Expectations"
"Havisham’s face, and had risen to manhood content to be partners with","Great Expectations"
"Joe in the honest old forge. Many a time of an evening, when I sat","Great Expectations"
"alone looking at the fire, I thought, after all there was no fire like","Great Expectations"
"the forge fire and the kitchen fire at home.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Yet Estella was so inseparable from all my restlessness and disquiet of","Great Expectations"
"mind, that I really fell into confusion as to the limits of my own part","Great Expectations"
"in its production. That is to say, supposing I had had no expectations,","Great Expectations"
"and yet had had Estella to think of, I could not make out to my","Great Expectations"
"satisfaction that I should have done much better. Now, concerning the","Great Expectations"
"influence of my position on others, I was in no such difficulty, and so","Great Expectations"
"I perceived—though dimly enough perhaps—that it was not beneficial to","Great Expectations"
"anybody, and, above all, that it was not beneficial to Herbert. My","Great Expectations"
"lavish habits led his easy nature into expenses that he could not","Great Expectations"
"afford, corrupted the simplicity of his life, and disturbed his peace","Great Expectations"
"with anxieties and regrets. I was not at all remorseful for having","Great Expectations"
"unwittingly set those other branches of the Pocket family to the poor","Great Expectations"
"arts they practised; because such littlenesses were their natural bent,","Great Expectations"
"and would have been evoked by anybody else, if I had left them","Great Expectations"
"slumbering. But Herbert’s was a very different case, and it often","Great Expectations"
"caused me a twinge to think that I had done him evil service in","Great Expectations"
"crowding his sparely furnished chambers with incongruous upholstery","Great Expectations"
"work, and placing the Canary-breasted Avenger at his disposal.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"So now, as an infallible way of making little ease great ease, I began","Great Expectations"
"to contract a quantity of debt. I could hardly begin but Herbert must","Great Expectations"
"begin too, so he soon followed. At Startop’s suggestion, we put","Great Expectations"
"ourselves down for election into a club called The Finches of the","Great Expectations"
"Grove: the object of which institution I have never divined, if it were","Great Expectations"
"not that the members should dine expensively once a fortnight, to","Great Expectations"
"quarrel among themselves as much as possible after dinner, and to cause","Great Expectations"
"six waiters to get drunk on the stairs. I know that these gratifying","Great Expectations"
"social ends were so invariably accomplished, that Herbert and I","Great Expectations"
"understood nothing else to be referred to in the first standing toast","Great Expectations"
"of the society: which ran “Gentlemen, may the present promotion of good","Great Expectations"
"feeling ever reign predominant among the Finches of the Grove.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The Finches spent their money foolishly (the Hotel we dined at was in","Great Expectations"
"Covent Garden), and the first Finch I saw when I had the honour of","Great Expectations"
"joining the Grove was Bentley Drummle, at that time floundering about","Great Expectations"
"town in a cab of his own, and doing a great deal of damage to the posts","Great Expectations"
"at the street corners. Occasionally, he shot himself out of his","Great Expectations"
"equipage headforemost over the apron; and I saw him on one occasion","Great Expectations"
"deliver himself at the door of the Grove in this unintentional way—like","Great Expectations"
"coals. But here I anticipate a little, for I was not a Finch, and could","Great Expectations"
"not be, according to the sacred laws of the society, until I came of","Great Expectations"
"age.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"In my confidence in my own resources, I would willingly have taken","Great Expectations"
"Herbert’s expenses on myself; but Herbert was proud, and I could make","Great Expectations"
"no such proposal to him. So he got into difficulties in every","Great Expectations"
"direction, and continued to look about him. When we gradually fell into","Great Expectations"
"keeping late hours and late company, I noticed that he looked about him","Great Expectations"
"with a desponding eye at breakfast-time; that he began to look about","Great Expectations"
"him more hopefully about midday; that he drooped when he came into","Great Expectations"
"dinner; that he seemed to descry Capital in the distance, rather","Great Expectations"
"clearly, after dinner; that he all but realised Capital towards","Great Expectations"
"midnight; and that at about two o’clock in the morning, he became so","Great Expectations"
"deeply despondent again as to talk of buying a rifle and going to","Great Expectations"
"America, with a general purpose of compelling buffaloes to make his","Great Expectations"
"fortune.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I was usually at Hammersmith about half the week, and when I was at","Great Expectations"
"Hammersmith I haunted Richmond, whereof separately by and by. Herbert","Great Expectations"
"would often come to Hammersmith when I was there, and I think at those","Great Expectations"
"seasons his father would occasionally have some passing perception that","Great Expectations"
"the opening he was looking for, had not appeared yet. But in the","Great Expectations"
"general tumbling up of the family, his tumbling out in life somewhere,","Great Expectations"
"was a thing to transact itself somehow. In the meantime Mr. Pocket grew","Great Expectations"
"greyer, and tried oftener to lift himself out of his perplexities by","Great Expectations"
"the hair. While Mrs. Pocket tripped up the family with her footstool,","Great Expectations"
"read her book of dignities, lost her pocket-handkerchief, told us about","Great Expectations"
"her grandpapa, and taught the young idea how to shoot, by shooting it","Great Expectations"
"into bed whenever it attracted her notice.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As I am now generalising a period of my life with the object of","Great Expectations"
"clearing my way before me, I can scarcely do so better than by at once","Great Expectations"
"completing the description of our usual manners and customs at","Great Expectations"
"Barnard’s Inn.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We spent as much money as we could, and got as little for it as people","Great Expectations"
"could make up their minds to give us. We were always more or less","Great Expectations"
"miserable, and most of our acquaintance were in the same condition.","Great Expectations"
"There was a gay fiction among us that we were constantly enjoying","Great Expectations"
"ourselves, and a skeleton truth that we never did. To the best of my","Great Expectations"
"belief, our case was in the last aspect a rather common one.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Every morning, with an air ever new, Herbert went into the City to look","Great Expectations"
"about him. I often paid him a visit in the dark back-room in which he","Great Expectations"
"consorted with an ink-jar, a hat-peg, a coal-box, a string-box, an","Great Expectations"
"almanac, a desk and stool, and a ruler; and I do not remember that I","Great Expectations"
"ever saw him do anything else but look about him. If we all did what we","Great Expectations"
"undertake to do, as faithfully as Herbert did, we might live in a","Great Expectations"
"Republic of the Virtues. He had nothing else to do, poor fellow, except","Great Expectations"
"at a certain hour of every afternoon to “go to Lloyd’s”—in observance","Great Expectations"
"of a ceremony of seeing his principal, I think. He never did anything","Great Expectations"
"else in connection with Lloyd’s that I could find out, except come back","Great Expectations"
"again. When he felt his case unusually serious, and that he positively","Great Expectations"
"must find an opening, he would go on ’Change at a busy time, and walk","Great Expectations"
"in and out, in a kind of gloomy country dance figure, among the","Great Expectations"
"assembled magnates. “For,” says Herbert to me, coming home to dinner on","Great Expectations"
"one of those special occasions, “I find the truth to be, Handel, that","Great Expectations"
"an opening won’t come to one, but one must go to it,—so I have been.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"If we had been less attached to one another, I think we must have hated","Great Expectations"
"one another regularly every morning. I detested the chambers beyond","Great Expectations"
"expression at that period of repentance, and could not endure the sight","Great Expectations"
"of the Avenger’s livery; which had a more expensive and a less","Great Expectations"
"remunerative appearance then than at any other time in the","Great Expectations"
"four-and-twenty hours. As we got more and more into debt, breakfast","Great Expectations"
"became a hollower and hollower form, and, being on one occasion at","Great Expectations"
"breakfast-time threatened (by letter) with legal proceedings, “not","Great Expectations"
"unwholly unconnected,” as my local paper might put it, “with jewelery,”","Great Expectations"
"I went so far as to seize the Avenger by his blue collar and shake him","Great Expectations"
"off his feet,—so that he was actually in the air, like a booted","Great Expectations"
"Cupid,—for presuming to suppose that we wanted a roll.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"At certain times—meaning at uncertain times, for they depended on our","Great Expectations"
"humour—I would say to Herbert, as if it were a remarkable discovery,—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“My dear Herbert, we are getting on badly.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“My dear Handel,” Herbert would say to me, in all sincerity, “if you","Great Expectations"
"will believe me, those very words were on my lips, by a strange","Great Expectations"
"coincidence.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Then, Herbert,” I would respond, “let us look into our affairs.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We always derived profound satisfaction from making an appointment for","Great Expectations"
"this purpose. I always thought this was business, this was the way to","Great Expectations"
"confront the thing, this was the way to take the foe by the throat. And","Great Expectations"
"I know Herbert thought so too.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We ordered something rather special for dinner, with a bottle of","Great Expectations"
"something similarly out of the common way, in order that our minds","Great Expectations"
"might be fortified for the occasion, and we might come well up to the","Great Expectations"
"mark. Dinner over, we produced a bundle of pens, a copious supply of","Great Expectations"
"ink, and a goodly show of writing and blotting paper. For there was","Great Expectations"
"something very comfortable in having plenty of stationery.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I would then take a sheet of paper, and write across the top of it, in","Great Expectations"
"a neat hand, the heading, “Memorandum of Pip’s debts”; with Barnard’s","Great Expectations"
"Inn and the date very carefully added. Herbert would also take a sheet","Great Expectations"
"of paper, and write across it with similar formalities, “Memorandum of","Great Expectations"
"Herbert’s debts.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Each of us would then refer to a confused heap of papers at his side,","Great Expectations"
"which had been thrown into drawers, worn into holes in pockets, half","Great Expectations"
"burnt in lighting candles, stuck for weeks into the looking-glass, and","Great Expectations"
"otherwise damaged. The sound of our pens going refreshed us","Great Expectations"
"exceedingly, insomuch that I sometimes found it difficult to","Great Expectations"
"distinguish between this edifying business proceeding and actually","Great Expectations"
"paying the money. In point of meritorious character, the two things","Great Expectations"
"seemed about equal.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"When we had written a little while, I would ask Herbert how he got on?","Great Expectations"
"Herbert probably would have been scratching his head in a most rueful","Great Expectations"
"manner at the sight of his accumulating figures.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“They are mounting up, Handel,” Herbert would say; “upon my life, they","Great Expectations"
"are mounting up.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Be firm, Herbert,” I would retort, plying my own pen with great","Great Expectations"
"assiduity. “Look the thing in the face. Look into your affairs. Stare","Great Expectations"
"them out of countenance.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“So I would, Handel, only they are staring _me_ out of countenance.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"However, my determined manner would have its effect, and Herbert would","Great Expectations"
"fall to work again. After a time he would give up once more, on the","Great Expectations"
"plea that he had not got Cobbs’s bill, or Lobbs’s, or Nobbs’s, as the","Great Expectations"
"case might be.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Then, Herbert, estimate; estimate it in round numbers, and put it","Great Expectations"
"down.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What a fellow of resource you are!” my friend would reply, with","Great Expectations"
"admiration. “Really your business powers are very remarkable.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I thought so too. I established with myself, on these occasions, the","Great Expectations"
"reputation of a first-rate man of business,—prompt, decisive,","Great Expectations"
"energetic, clear, cool-headed. When I had got all my responsibilities","Great Expectations"
"down upon my list, I compared each with the bill, and ticked it off. My","Great Expectations"
"self-approval when I ticked an entry was quite a luxurious sensation.","Great Expectations"
"When I had no more ticks to make, I folded all my bills up uniformly,","Great Expectations"
"docketed each on the back, and tied the whole into a symmetrical","Great Expectations"
"bundle. Then I did the same for Herbert (who modestly said he had not","Great Expectations"
"my administrative genius), and felt that I had brought his affairs into","Great Expectations"
"a focus for him.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"My business habits had one other bright feature, which I called","Great Expectations"
"“leaving a Margin.” For example; supposing Herbert’s debts to be one","Great Expectations"
"hundred and sixty-four pounds four-and-twopence, I would say, “Leave a","Great Expectations"
"margin, and put them down at two hundred.” Or, supposing my own to be","Great Expectations"
"four times as much, I would leave a margin, and put them down at seven","Great Expectations"
"hundred. I had the highest opinion of the wisdom of this same Margin,","Great Expectations"
"but I am bound to acknowledge that on looking back, I deem it to have","Great Expectations"
"been an expensive device. For, we always ran into new debt immediately,","Great Expectations"
"to the full extent of the margin, and sometimes, in the sense of","Great Expectations"
"freedom and solvency it imparted, got pretty far on into another","Great Expectations"
"margin.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"But there was a calm, a rest, a virtuous hush, consequent on these","Great Expectations"
"examinations of our affairs that gave me, for the time, an admirable","Great Expectations"
"opinion of myself. Soothed by my exertions, my method, and Herbert’s","Great Expectations"
"compliments, I would sit with his symmetrical bundle and my own on the","Great Expectations"
"table before me among the stationery, and feel like a Bank of some","Great Expectations"
"sort, rather than a private individual.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We shut our outer door on these solemn occasions, in order that we","Great Expectations"
"might not be interrupted. I had fallen into my serene state one","Great Expectations"
"evening, when we heard a letter dropped through the slit in the said","Great Expectations"
"door, and fall on the ground. “It’s for you, Handel,” said Herbert,","Great Expectations"
"going out and coming back with it, “and I hope there is nothing the","Great Expectations"
"matter.” This was in allusion to its heavy black seal and border.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The letter was signed Trabb & Co., and its contents were simply, that I","Great Expectations"
"was an honoured sir, and that they begged to inform me that Mrs. J.","Great Expectations"
"Gargery had departed this life on Monday last at twenty minutes past","Great Expectations"
"six in the evening, and that my attendance was requested at the","Great Expectations"
"interment on Monday next at three o’clock in the afternoon.","Great Expectations"

"Chapter XXXV.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was the first time that a grave had opened in my road of life, and","Great Expectations"
"the gap it made in the smooth ground was wonderful. The figure of my","Great Expectations"
"sister in her chair by the kitchen fire, haunted me night and day. That","Great Expectations"
"the place could possibly be, without her, was something my mind seemed","Great Expectations"
"unable to compass; and whereas she had seldom or never been in my","Great Expectations"
"thoughts of late, I had now the strangest ideas that she was coming","Great Expectations"
"towards me in the street, or that she would presently knock at the","Great Expectations"
"door. In my rooms too, with which she had never been at all associated,","Great Expectations"
"there was at once the blankness of death and a perpetual suggestion of","Great Expectations"
"the sound of her voice or the turn of her face or figure, as if she","Great Expectations"
"were still alive and had been often there.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Whatever my fortunes might have been, I could scarcely have recalled my","Great Expectations"
"sister with much tenderness. But I suppose there is a shock of regret","Great Expectations"
"which may exist without much tenderness. Under its influence (and","Great Expectations"
"perhaps to make up for the want of the softer feeling) I was seized","Great Expectations"
"with a violent indignation against the assailant from whom she had","Great Expectations"
"suffered so much; and I felt that on sufficient proof I could have","Great Expectations"
"revengefully pursued Orlick, or any one else, to the last extremity.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Having written to Joe, to offer him consolation, and to assure him that","Great Expectations"
"I would come to the funeral, I passed the intermediate days in the","Great Expectations"
"curious state of mind I have glanced at. I went down early in the","Great Expectations"
"morning, and alighted at the Blue Boar in good time to walk over to the","Great Expectations"
"forge.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was fine summer weather again, and, as I walked along, the times","Great Expectations"
"when I was a little helpless creature, and my sister did not spare me,","Great Expectations"
"vividly returned. But they returned with a gentle tone upon them that","Great Expectations"
"softened even the edge of Tickler. For now, the very breath of the","Great Expectations"
"beans and clover whispered to my heart that the day must come when it","Great Expectations"
"would be well for my memory that others walking in the sunshine should","Great Expectations"
"be softened as they thought of me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"At last I came within sight of the house, and saw that Trabb and Co.","Great Expectations"
"had put in a funereal execution and taken possession. Two dismally","Great Expectations"
"absurd persons, each ostentatiously exhibiting a crutch done up in a","Great Expectations"
"black bandage,—as if that instrument could possibly communicate any","Great Expectations"
"comfort to anybody,—were posted at the front door; and in one of them I","Great Expectations"
"recognised a postboy discharged from the Boar for turning a young","Great Expectations"
"couple into a sawpit on their bridal morning, in consequence of","Great Expectations"
"intoxication rendering it necessary for him to ride his horse clasped","Great Expectations"
"round the neck with both arms. All the children of the village, and","Great Expectations"
"most of the women, were admiring these sable warders and the closed","Great Expectations"
"windows of the house and forge; and as I came up, one of the two","Great Expectations"
"warders (the postboy) knocked at the door,—implying that I was far too","Great Expectations"
"much exhausted by grief to have strength remaining to knock for myself.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Another sable warder (a carpenter, who had once eaten two geese for a","Great Expectations"
"wager) opened the door, and showed me into the best parlour. Here, Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Trabb had taken unto himself the best table, and had got all the leaves","Great Expectations"
"up, and was holding a kind of black Bazaar, with the aid of a quantity","Great Expectations"
"of black pins. At the moment of my arrival, he had just finished","Great Expectations"
"putting somebody’s hat into black long-clothes, like an African baby;","Great Expectations"
"so he held out his hand for mine. But I, misled by the action, and","Great Expectations"
"confused by the occasion, shook hands with him with every testimony of","Great Expectations"
"warm affection.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Poor dear Joe, entangled in a little black cloak tied in a large bow","Great Expectations"
"under his chin, was seated apart at the upper end of the room; where,","Great Expectations"
"as chief mourner, he had evidently been stationed by Trabb. When I bent","Great Expectations"
"down and said to him, “Dear Joe, how are you?” he said, “Pip, old chap,","Great Expectations"
"you knowed her when she were a fine figure of a—” and clasped my hand","Great Expectations"
"and said no more.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Biddy, looking very neat and modest in her black dress, went quietly","Great Expectations"
"here and there, and was very helpful. When I had spoken to Biddy, as I","Great Expectations"
"thought it not a time for talking I went and sat down near Joe, and","Great Expectations"
"there began to wonder in what part of the house it—she—my sister—was.","Great Expectations"
"The air of the parlour being faint with the smell of sweet-cake, I","Great Expectations"
"looked about for the table of refreshments; it was scarcely visible","Great Expectations"
"until one had got accustomed to the gloom, but there was a cut-up plum","Great Expectations"
"cake upon it, and there were cut-up oranges, and sandwiches, and","Great Expectations"
"biscuits, and two decanters that I knew very well as ornaments, but had","Great Expectations"
"never seen used in all my life; one full of port, and one of sherry.","Great Expectations"
"Standing at this table, I became conscious of the servile Pumblechook","Great Expectations"
"in a black cloak and several yards of hatband, who was alternately","Great Expectations"
"stuffing himself, and making obsequious movements to catch my","Great Expectations"
"attention. The moment he succeeded, he came over to me (breathing","Great Expectations"
"sherry and crumbs), and said in a subdued voice, “May I, dear sir?” and","Great Expectations"
"did. I then descried Mr. and Mrs. Hubble; the last-named in a decent","Great Expectations"
"speechless paroxysm in a corner. We were all going to “follow,” and","Great Expectations"
"were all in course of being tied up separately (by Trabb) into","Great Expectations"
"ridiculous bundles.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Which I meantersay, Pip,” Joe whispered me, as we were being what Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Trabb called “formed” in the parlour, two and two,—and it was","Great Expectations"
"dreadfully like a preparation for some grim kind of dance; “which I","Great Expectations"
"meantersay, sir, as I would in preference have carried her to the","Great Expectations"
"church myself, along with three or four friendly ones wot come to it","Great Expectations"
"with willing harts and arms, but it were considered wot the neighbours","Great Expectations"
"would look down on such and would be of opinions as it were wanting in","Great Expectations"
"respect.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Pocket-handkerchiefs out, all!” cried Mr. Trabb at this point, in a","Great Expectations"
"depressed business-like voice. “Pocket-handkerchiefs out! We are","Great Expectations"
"ready!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"So we all put our pocket-handkerchiefs to our faces, as if our noses","Great Expectations"
"were bleeding, and filed out two and two; Joe and I; Biddy and","Great Expectations"
"Pumblechook; Mr. and Mrs. Hubble. The remains of my poor sister had","Great Expectations"
"been brought round by the kitchen door, and, it being a point of","Great Expectations"
"Undertaking ceremony that the six bearers must be stifled and blinded","Great Expectations"
"under a horrible black velvet housing with a white border, the whole","Great Expectations"
"looked like a blind monster with twelve human legs, shuffling and","Great Expectations"
"blundering along, under the guidance of two keepers,—the postboy and","Great Expectations"
"his comrade.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The neighbourhood, however, highly approved of these arrangements, and","Great Expectations"
"we were much admired as we went through the village; the more youthful","Great Expectations"
"and vigorous part of the community making dashes now and then to cut us","Great Expectations"
"off, and lying in wait to intercept us at points of vantage. At such","Great Expectations"
"times the more exuberant among them called out in an excited manner on","Great Expectations"
"our emergence round some corner of expectancy, “_Here_ they come!”","Great Expectations"
"“_Here_ they are!” and we were all but cheered. In this progress I was","Great Expectations"
"much annoyed by the abject Pumblechook, who, being behind me, persisted","Great Expectations"
"all the way as a delicate attention in arranging my streaming hatband,","Great Expectations"
"and smoothing my cloak. My thoughts were further distracted by the","Great Expectations"
"excessive pride of Mr. and Mrs. Hubble, who were surpassingly conceited","Great Expectations"
"and vainglorious in being members of so distinguished a procession.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"And now the range of marshes lay clear before us, with the sails of the","Great Expectations"
"ships on the river growing out of it; and we went into the churchyard,","Great Expectations"
"close to the graves of my unknown parents, Philip Pirrip, late of this","Great Expectations"
"parish, and Also Georgiana, Wife of the Above. And there, my sister was","Great Expectations"
"laid quietly in the earth, while the larks sang high above it, and the","Great Expectations"
"light wind strewed it with beautiful shadows of clouds and trees.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Of the conduct of the worldly minded Pumblechook while this was doing,","Great Expectations"
"I desire to say no more than it was all addressed to me; and that even","Great Expectations"
"when those noble passages were read which remind humanity how it","Great Expectations"
"brought nothing into the world and can take nothing out, and how it","Great Expectations"
"fleeth like a shadow and never continueth long in one stay, I heard him","Great Expectations"
"cough a reservation of the case of a young gentleman who came","Great Expectations"
"unexpectedly into large property. When we got back, he had the","Great Expectations"
"hardihood to tell me that he wished my sister could have known I had","Great Expectations"
"done her so much honour, and to hint that she would have considered it","Great Expectations"
"reasonably purchased at the price of her death. After that, he drank","Great Expectations"
"all the rest of the sherry, and Mr. Hubble drank the port, and the two","Great Expectations"
"talked (which I have since observed to be customary in such cases) as","Great Expectations"
"if they were of quite another race from the deceased, and were","Great Expectations"
"notoriously immortal. Finally, he went away with Mr. and Mrs.","Great Expectations"
"Hubble,—to make an evening of it, I felt sure, and to tell the Jolly","Great Expectations"
"Bargemen that he was the founder of my fortunes and my earliest","Great Expectations"
"benefactor.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"When they were all gone, and when Trabb and his men—but not his Boy; I","Great Expectations"
"looked for him—had crammed their mummery into bags, and were gone too,","Great Expectations"
"the house felt wholesomer. Soon afterwards, Biddy, Joe, and I, had a","Great Expectations"
"cold dinner together; but we dined in the best parlour, not in the old","Great Expectations"
"kitchen, and Joe was so exceedingly particular what he did with his","Great Expectations"
"knife and fork and the saltcellar and what not, that there was great","Great Expectations"
"restraint upon us. But after dinner, when I made him take his pipe, and","Great Expectations"
"when I had loitered with him about the forge, and when we sat down","Great Expectations"
"together on the great block of stone outside it, we got on better. I","Great Expectations"
"noticed that after the funeral Joe changed his clothes so far, as to","Great Expectations"
"make a compromise between his Sunday dress and working dress; in which","Great Expectations"
"the dear fellow looked natural, and like the Man he was.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He was very much pleased by my asking if I might sleep in my own little","Great Expectations"
"room, and I was pleased too; for I felt that I had done rather a great","Great Expectations"
"thing in making the request. When the shadows of evening were closing","Great Expectations"
"in, I took an opportunity of getting into the garden with Biddy for a","Great Expectations"
"little talk.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Biddy,” said I, “I think you might have written to me about these sad","Great Expectations"
"matters.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Do you, Mr. Pip?” said Biddy. “I should have written if I had thought","Great Expectations"
"that.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Don’t suppose that I mean to be unkind, Biddy, when I say I consider","Great Expectations"
"that you ought to have thought that.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Do you, Mr. Pip?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"She was so quiet, and had such an orderly, good, and pretty way with","Great Expectations"
"her, that I did not like the thought of making her cry again. After","Great Expectations"
"looking a little at her downcast eyes as she walked beside me, I gave","Great Expectations"
"up that point.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I suppose it will be difficult for you to remain here now, Biddy","Great Expectations"
"dear?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Oh! I can’t do so, Mr. Pip,” said Biddy, in a tone of regret but still","Great Expectations"
"of quiet conviction. “I have been speaking to Mrs. Hubble, and I am","Great Expectations"
"going to her to-morrow. I hope we shall be able to take some care of","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Gargery, together, until he settles down.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“How are you going to live, Biddy? If you want any mo—”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“How am I going to live?” repeated Biddy, striking in, with a momentary","Great Expectations"
"flush upon her face. “I’ll tell you, Mr. Pip. I am going to try to get","Great Expectations"
"the place of mistress in the new school nearly finished here. I can be","Great Expectations"
"well recommended by all the neighbours, and I hope I can be industrious","Great Expectations"
"and patient, and teach myself while I teach others. You know, Mr. Pip,”","Great Expectations"
"pursued Biddy, with a smile, as she raised her eyes to my face, “the","Great Expectations"
"new schools are not like the old, but I learnt a good deal from you","Great Expectations"
"after that time, and have had time since then to improve.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I think you would always improve, Biddy, under any circumstances.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Ah! Except in my bad side of human nature,” murmured Biddy.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was not so much a reproach as an irresistible thinking aloud. Well!","Great Expectations"
"I thought I would give up that point too. So, I walked a little further","Great Expectations"
"with Biddy, looking silently at her downcast eyes.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I have not heard the particulars of my sister’s death, Biddy.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“They are very slight, poor thing. She had been in one of her bad","Great Expectations"
"states—though they had got better of late, rather than worse—for four","Great Expectations"
"days, when she came out of it in the evening, just at tea-time, and","Great Expectations"
"said quite plainly, ‘Joe.’ As she had never said any word for a long","Great Expectations"
"while, I ran and fetched in Mr. Gargery from the forge. She made signs","Great Expectations"
"to me that she wanted him to sit down close to her, and wanted me to","Great Expectations"
"put her arms round his neck. So I put them round his neck, and she laid","Great Expectations"
"her head down on his shoulder quite content and satisfied. And so she","Great Expectations"
"presently said ‘Joe’ again, and once ‘Pardon,’ and once ‘Pip.’ And so","Great Expectations"
"she never lifted her head up any more, and it was just an hour later","Great Expectations"
"when we laid it down on her own bed, because we found she was gone.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Biddy cried; the darkening garden, and the lane, and the stars that","Great Expectations"
"were coming out, were blurred in my own sight.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Nothing was ever discovered, Biddy?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Nothing.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Do you know what is become of Orlick?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I should think from the colour of his clothes that he is working in","Great Expectations"
"the quarries.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Of course you have seen him then?—Why are you looking at that dark","Great Expectations"
"tree in the lane?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I saw him there, on the night she died.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“That was not the last time either, Biddy?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No; I have seen him there, since we have been walking here.—It is of","Great Expectations"
"no use,” said Biddy, laying her hand upon my arm, as I was for running","Great Expectations"
"out, “you know I would not deceive you; he was not there a minute, and","Great Expectations"
"he is gone.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It revived my utmost indignation to find that she was still pursued by","Great Expectations"
"this fellow, and I felt inveterate against him. I told her so, and told","Great Expectations"
"her that I would spend any money or take any pains to drive him out of","Great Expectations"
"that country. By degrees she led me into more temperate talk, and she","Great Expectations"
"told me how Joe loved me, and how Joe never complained of anything,—she","Great Expectations"
"didn’t say, of me; she had no need; I knew what she meant,—but ever did","Great Expectations"
"his duty in his way of life, with a strong hand, a quiet tongue, and a","Great Expectations"
"gentle heart.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Indeed, it would be hard to say too much for him,” said I; “and Biddy,","Great Expectations"
"we must often speak of these things, for of course I shall be often","Great Expectations"
"down here now. I am not going to leave poor Joe alone.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Biddy said never a single word.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Biddy, don’t you hear me?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, Mr. Pip.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Not to mention your calling me Mr. Pip,—which appears to me to be in","Great Expectations"
"bad taste, Biddy,—what do you mean?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What do I mean?” asked Biddy, timidly.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Biddy,” said I, in a virtuously self-asserting manner, “I must request","Great Expectations"
"to know what you mean by this?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“By this?” said Biddy.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Now, don’t echo,” I retorted. “You used not to echo, Biddy.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Used not!” said Biddy. “O Mr. Pip! Used!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Well! I rather thought I would give up that point too. After another","Great Expectations"
"silent turn in the garden, I fell back on the main position.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Biddy,” said I, “I made a remark respecting my coming down here often,","Great Expectations"
"to see Joe, which you received with a marked silence. Have the","Great Expectations"
"goodness, Biddy, to tell me why.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Are you quite sure, then, that you WILL come to see him often?” asked","Great Expectations"
"Biddy, stopping in the narrow garden walk, and looking at me under the","Great Expectations"
"stars with a clear and honest eye.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“O dear me!” said I, as if I found myself compelled to give up Biddy in","Great Expectations"
"despair. “This really is a very bad side of human nature! Don’t say any","Great Expectations"
"more, if you please, Biddy. This shocks me very much.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"For which cogent reason I kept Biddy at a distance during supper, and","Great Expectations"
"when I went up to my own old little room, took as stately a leave of","Great Expectations"
"her as I could, in my murmuring soul, deem reconcilable with the","Great Expectations"
"churchyard and the event of the day. As often as I was restless in the","Great Expectations"
"night, and that was every quarter of an hour, I reflected what an","Great Expectations"
"unkindness, what an injury, what an injustice, Biddy had done me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Early in the morning I was to go. Early in the morning I was out, and","Great Expectations"
"looking in, unseen, at one of the wooden windows of the forge. There I","Great Expectations"
"stood, for minutes, looking at Joe, already at work with a glow of","Great Expectations"
"health and strength upon his face that made it show as if the bright","Great Expectations"
"sun of the life in store for him were shining on it.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Good-bye, dear Joe!—No, don’t wipe it off—for God’s sake, give me your","Great Expectations"
"blackened hand!—I shall be down soon and often.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"[Illustration]","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Never too soon, sir,” said Joe, “and never too often, Pip!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Biddy was waiting for me at the kitchen door, with a mug of new milk","Great Expectations"
"and a crust of bread. “Biddy,” said I, when I gave her my hand at","Great Expectations"
"parting, “I am not angry, but I am hurt.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No, don’t be hurt,” she pleaded quite pathetically; “let only me be","Great Expectations"
"hurt, if I have been ungenerous.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Once more, the mists were rising as I walked away. If they disclosed to","Great Expectations"
"me, as I suspect they did, that I should _not_ come back, and that","Great Expectations"
"Biddy was quite right, all I can say is,—they were quite right too.","Great Expectations"

"Chapter XXXVI.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Herbert and I went on from bad to worse, in the way of increasing our","Great Expectations"
"debts, looking into our affairs, leaving Margins, and the like","Great Expectations"
"exemplary transactions; and Time went on, whether or no, as he has a","Great Expectations"
"way of doing; and I came of age,—in fulfilment of Herbert’s prediction,","Great Expectations"
"that I should do so before I knew where I was.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Herbert himself had come of age eight months before me. As he had","Great Expectations"
"nothing else than his majority to come into, the event did not make a","Great Expectations"
"profound sensation in Barnard’s Inn. But we had looked forward to my","Great Expectations"
"one-and-twentieth birthday, with a crowd of speculations and","Great Expectations"
"anticipations, for we had both considered that my guardian could hardly","Great Expectations"
"help saying something definite on that occasion.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I had taken care to have it well understood in Little Britain when my","Great Expectations"
"birthday was. On the day before it, I received an official note from","Great Expectations"
"Wemmick, informing me that Mr. Jaggers would be glad if I would call","Great Expectations"
"upon him at five in the afternoon of the auspicious day. This convinced","Great Expectations"
"us that something great was to happen, and threw me into an unusual","Great Expectations"
"flutter when I repaired to my guardian’s office, a model of","Great Expectations"
"punctuality.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"In the outer office Wemmick offered me his congratulations, and","Great Expectations"
"incidentally rubbed the side of his nose with a folded piece of","Great Expectations"
"tissue-paper that I liked the look of. But he said nothing respecting","Great Expectations"
"it, and motioned me with a nod into my guardian’s room. It was","Great Expectations"
"November, and my guardian was standing before his fire leaning his back","Great Expectations"
"against the chimney-piece, with his hands under his coattails.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well, Pip,” said he, “I must call you Mr. Pip to-day. Congratulations,","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Pip.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We shook hands,—he was always a remarkably short shaker,—and I thanked","Great Expectations"
"him.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Take a chair, Mr. Pip,” said my guardian.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As I sat down, and he preserved his attitude and bent his brows at his","Great Expectations"
"boots, I felt at a disadvantage, which reminded me of that old time","Great Expectations"
"when I had been put upon a tombstone. The two ghastly casts on the","Great Expectations"
"shelf were not far from him, and their expression was as if they were","Great Expectations"
"making a stupid apoplectic attempt to attend to the conversation.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Now my young friend,” my guardian began, as if I were a witness in the","Great Expectations"
"box, “I am going to have a word or two with you.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“If you please, sir.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What do you suppose,” said Mr. Jaggers, bending forward to look at the","Great Expectations"
"ground, and then throwing his head back to look at the ceiling,—“what","Great Expectations"
"do you suppose you are living at the rate of?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“At the rate of, sir?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“At,” repeated Mr. Jaggers, still looking at the ceiling,","Great Expectations"
"“the—rate—of?” And then looked all round the room, and paused with his","Great Expectations"
"pocket-handkerchief in his hand, half-way to his nose.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I had looked into my affairs so often, that I had thoroughly destroyed","Great Expectations"
"any slight notion I might ever have had of their bearings. Reluctantly,","Great Expectations"
"I confessed myself quite unable to answer the question. This reply","Great Expectations"
"seemed agreeable to Mr. Jaggers, who said, “I thought so!” and blew his","Great Expectations"
"nose with an air of satisfaction.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Now, I have asked _you_ a question, my friend,” said Mr. Jaggers.","Great Expectations"
"“Have you anything to ask _me_?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Of course it would be a great relief to me to ask you several","Great Expectations"
"questions, sir; but I remember your prohibition.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Ask one,” said Mr. Jaggers.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Is my benefactor to be made known to me to-day?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No. Ask another.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Is that confidence to be imparted to me soon?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Waive that, a moment,” said Mr. Jaggers, “and ask another.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I looked about me, but there appeared to be now no possible escape from","Great Expectations"
"the inquiry, “Have-I—anything to receive, sir?” On that, Mr. Jaggers","Great Expectations"
"said, triumphantly, “I thought we should come to it!” and called to","Great Expectations"
"Wemmick to give him that piece of paper. Wemmick appeared, handed it","Great Expectations"
"in, and disappeared.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Now, Mr. Pip,” said Mr. Jaggers, “attend, if you please. You have been","Great Expectations"
"drawing pretty freely here; your name occurs pretty often in Wemmick’s","Great Expectations"
"cash-book; but you are in debt, of course?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I am afraid I must say yes, sir.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You know you must say yes; don’t you?” said Mr. Jaggers.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, sir.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I don’t ask you what you owe, because you don’t know; and if you did","Great Expectations"
"know, you wouldn’t tell me; you would say less. Yes, yes, my friend,”","Great Expectations"
"cried Mr. Jaggers, waving his forefinger to stop me as I made a show of","Great Expectations"
"protesting: “it’s likely enough that you think you wouldn’t, but you","Great Expectations"
"would. You’ll excuse me, but I know better than you. Now, take this","Great Expectations"
"piece of paper in your hand. You have got it? Very good. Now, unfold it","Great Expectations"
"and tell me what it is.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“This is a bank-note,” said I, “for five hundred pounds.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“That is a bank-note,” repeated Mr. Jaggers, “for five hundred pounds.","Great Expectations"
"And a very handsome sum of money too, I think. You consider it so?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“How could I do otherwise!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Ah! But answer the question,” said Mr. Jaggers.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Undoubtedly.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You consider it, undoubtedly, a handsome sum of money. Now, that","Great Expectations"
"handsome sum of money, Pip, is your own. It is a present to you on this","Great Expectations"
"day, in earnest of your expectations. And at the rate of that handsome","Great Expectations"
"sum of money per annum, and at no higher rate, you are to live until","Great Expectations"
"the donor of the whole appears. That is to say, you will now take your","Great Expectations"
"money affairs entirely into your own hands, and you will draw from","Great Expectations"
"Wemmick one hundred and twenty-five pounds per quarter, until you are","Great Expectations"
"in communication with the fountain-head, and no longer with the mere","Great Expectations"
"agent. As I have told you before, I am the mere agent. I execute my","Great Expectations"
"instructions, and I am paid for doing so. I think them injudicious, but","Great Expectations"
"I am not paid for giving any opinion on their merits.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I was beginning to express my gratitude to my benefactor for the great","Great Expectations"
"liberality with which I was treated, when Mr. Jaggers stopped me. “I am","Great Expectations"
"not paid, Pip,” said he, coolly, “to carry your words to any one;” and","Great Expectations"
"then gathered up his coat-tails, as he had gathered up the subject, and","Great Expectations"
"stood frowning at his boots as if he suspected them of designs against","Great Expectations"
"him.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"After a pause, I hinted,—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“There was a question just now, Mr. Jaggers, which you desired me to","Great Expectations"
"waive for a moment. I hope I am doing nothing wrong in asking it","Great Expectations"
"again?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What is it?” said he.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I might have known that he would never help me out; but it took me","Great Expectations"
"aback to have to shape the question afresh, as if it were quite new.","Great Expectations"
"“Is it likely,” I said, after hesitating, “that my patron, the","Great Expectations"
"fountain-head you have spoken of, Mr. Jaggers, will soon—” there I","Great Expectations"
"delicately stopped.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Will soon what?” asked Mr. Jaggers. “That’s no question as it stands,","Great Expectations"
"you know.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Will soon come to London,” said I, after casting about for a precise","Great Expectations"
"form of words, “or summon me anywhere else?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Now, here,” replied Mr. Jaggers, fixing me for the first time with his","Great Expectations"
"dark deep-set eyes, “we must revert to the evening when we first","Great Expectations"
"encountered one another in your village. What did I tell you then,","Great Expectations"
"Pip?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You told me, Mr. Jaggers, that it might be years hence when that","Great Expectations"
"person appeared.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Just so,” said Mr. Jaggers, “that’s my answer.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As we looked full at one another, I felt my breath come quicker in my","Great Expectations"
"strong desire to get something out of him. And as I felt that it came","Great Expectations"
"quicker, and as I felt that he saw that it came quicker, I felt that I","Great Expectations"
"had less chance than ever of getting anything out of him.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Do you suppose it will still be years hence, Mr. Jaggers?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Jaggers shook his head,—not in negativing the question, but in","Great Expectations"
"altogether negativing the notion that he could anyhow be got to answer","Great Expectations"
"it,—and the two horrible casts of the twitched faces looked, when my","Great Expectations"
"eyes strayed up to them, as if they had come to a crisis in their","Great Expectations"
"suspended attention, and were going to sneeze.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Come!” said Mr. Jaggers, warming the backs of his legs with the backs","Great Expectations"
"of his warmed hands, “I’ll be plain with you, my friend Pip. That’s a","Great Expectations"
"question I must not be asked. You’ll understand that better, when I","Great Expectations"
"tell you it’s a question that might compromise _me_. Come! I’ll go a","Great Expectations"
"little further with you; I’ll say something more.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He bent down so low to frown at his boots, that he was able to rub the","Great Expectations"
"calves of his legs in the pause he made.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“When that person discloses,” said Mr. Jaggers, straightening himself,","Great Expectations"
"“you and that person will settle your own affairs. When that person","Great Expectations"
"discloses, my part in this business will cease and determine. When that","Great Expectations"
"person discloses, it will not be necessary for me to know anything","Great Expectations"
"about it. And that’s all I have got to say.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We looked at one another until I withdrew my eyes, and looked","Great Expectations"
"thoughtfully at the floor. From this last speech I derived the notion","Great Expectations"
"that Miss Havisham, for some reason or no reason, had not taken him","Great Expectations"
"into her confidence as to her designing me for Estella; that he","Great Expectations"
"resented this, and felt a jealousy about it; or that he really did","Great Expectations"
"object to that scheme, and would have nothing to do with it. When I","Great Expectations"
"raised my eyes again, I found that he had been shrewdly looking at me","Great Expectations"
"all the time, and was doing so still.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“If that is all you have to say, sir,” I remarked, “there can be","Great Expectations"
"nothing left for me to say.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He nodded assent, and pulled out his thief-dreaded watch, and asked me","Great Expectations"
"where I was going to dine? I replied at my own chambers, with Herbert.","Great Expectations"
"As a necessary sequence, I asked him if he would favour us with his","Great Expectations"
"company, and he promptly accepted the invitation. But he insisted on","Great Expectations"
"walking home with me, in order that I might make no extra preparation","Great Expectations"
"for him, and first he had a letter or two to write, and (of course) had","Great Expectations"
"his hands to wash. So I said I would go into the outer office and talk","Great Expectations"
"to Wemmick.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The fact was, that when the five hundred pounds had come into my","Great Expectations"
"pocket, a thought had come into my head which had been often there","Great Expectations"
"before; and it appeared to me that Wemmick was a good person to advise","Great Expectations"
"with concerning such thought.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He had already locked up his safe, and made preparations for going","Great Expectations"
"home. He had left his desk, brought out his two greasy office","Great Expectations"
"candlesticks and stood them in line with the snuffers on a slab near","Great Expectations"
"the door, ready to be extinguished; he had raked his fire low, put his","Great Expectations"
"hat and great-coat ready, and was beating himself all over the chest","Great Expectations"
"with his safe-key, as an athletic exercise after business.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Mr. Wemmick,” said I, “I want to ask your opinion. I am very desirous","Great Expectations"
"to serve a friend.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Wemmick tightened his post-office and shook his head, as if his opinion","Great Expectations"
"were dead against any fatal weakness of that sort.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“This friend,” I pursued, “is trying to get on in commercial life, but","Great Expectations"
"has no money, and finds it difficult and disheartening to make a","Great Expectations"
"beginning. Now I want somehow to help him to a beginning.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“With money down?” said Wemmick, in a tone drier than any sawdust.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“With _some_ money down,” I replied, for an uneasy remembrance shot","Great Expectations"
"across me of that symmetrical bundle of papers at home—“with _some_","Great Expectations"
"money down, and perhaps some anticipation of my expectations.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Mr. Pip,” said Wemmick, “I should like just to run over with you on my","Great Expectations"
"fingers, if you please, the names of the various bridges up as high as","Great Expectations"
"Chelsea Reach. Let’s see; there’s London, one; Southwark, two;","Great Expectations"
"Blackfriars, three; Waterloo, four; Westminster, five; Vauxhall, six.”","Great Expectations"
"He had checked off each bridge in its turn, with the handle of his","Great Expectations"
"safe-key on the palm of his hand. “There’s as many as six, you see, to","Great Expectations"
"choose from.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I don’t understand you,” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Choose your bridge, Mr. Pip,” returned Wemmick, “and take a walk upon","Great Expectations"
"your bridge, and pitch your money into the Thames over the centre arch","Great Expectations"
"of your bridge, and you know the end of it. Serve a friend with it, and","Great Expectations"
"you may know the end of it too,—but it’s a less pleasant and profitable","Great Expectations"
"end.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I could have posted a newspaper in his mouth, he made it so wide after","Great Expectations"
"saying this.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“This is very discouraging,” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Meant to be so,” said Wemmick.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Then is it your opinion,” I inquired, with some little indignation,","Great Expectations"
"“that a man should never—”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“—Invest portable property in a friend?” said Wemmick. “Certainly he","Great Expectations"
"should not. Unless he wants to get rid of the friend,—and then it","Great Expectations"
"becomes a question how much portable property it may be worth to get","Great Expectations"
"rid of him.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And that,” said I, “is your deliberate opinion, Mr. Wemmick?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“That,” he returned, “is my deliberate opinion in this office.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Ah!” said I, pressing him, for I thought I saw him near a loophole","Great Expectations"
"here; “but would that be your opinion at Walworth?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Mr. Pip,” he replied, with gravity, “Walworth is one place, and this","Great Expectations"
"office is another. Much as the Aged is one person, and Mr. Jaggers is","Great Expectations"
"another. They must not be confounded together. My Walworth sentiments","Great Expectations"
"must be taken at Walworth; none but my official sentiments can be taken","Great Expectations"
"in this office.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Very well,” said I, much relieved, “then I shall look you up at","Great Expectations"
"Walworth, you may depend upon it.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Mr. Pip,” he returned, “you will be welcome there, in a private and","Great Expectations"
"personal capacity.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We had held this conversation in a low voice, well knowing my","Great Expectations"
"guardian’s ears to be the sharpest of the sharp. As he now appeared in","Great Expectations"
"his doorway, towelling his hands, Wemmick got on his great-coat and","Great Expectations"
"stood by to snuff out the candles. We all three went into the street","Great Expectations"
"together, and from the door-step Wemmick turned his way, and Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Jaggers and I turned ours.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I could not help wishing more than once that evening, that Mr. Jaggers","Great Expectations"
"had had an Aged in Gerrard Street, or a Stinger, or a Something, or a","Great Expectations"
"Somebody, to unbend his brows a little. It was an uncomfortable","Great Expectations"
"consideration on a twenty-first birthday, that coming of age at all","Great Expectations"
"seemed hardly worth while in such a guarded and suspicious world as he","Great Expectations"
"made of it. He was a thousand times better informed and cleverer than","Great Expectations"
"Wemmick, and yet I would a thousand times rather have had Wemmick to","Great Expectations"
"dinner. And Mr. Jaggers made not me alone intensely melancholy,","Great Expectations"
"because, after he was gone, Herbert said of himself, with his eyes","Great Expectations"
"fixed on the fire, that he thought he must have committed a felony and","Great Expectations"
"forgotten the details of it, he felt so dejected and guilty.","Great Expectations"

"Chapter XXXVII.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Deeming Sunday the best day for taking Mr. Wemmick’s Walworth","Great Expectations"
"sentiments, I devoted the next ensuing Sunday afternoon to a pilgrimage","Great Expectations"
"to the Castle. On arriving before the battlements, I found the Union","Great Expectations"
"Jack flying and the drawbridge up; but undeterred by this show of","Great Expectations"
"defiance and resistance, I rang at the gate, and was admitted in a most","Great Expectations"
"pacific manner by the Aged.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“My son, sir,” said the old man, after securing the drawbridge, “rather","Great Expectations"
"had it in his mind that you might happen to drop in, and he left word","Great Expectations"
"that he would soon be home from his afternoon’s walk. He is very","Great Expectations"
"regular in his walks, is my son. Very regular in everything, is my","Great Expectations"
"son.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I nodded at the old gentleman as Wemmick himself might have nodded, and","Great Expectations"
"we went in and sat down by the fireside.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You made acquaintance with my son, sir,” said the old man, in his","Great Expectations"
"chirping way, while he warmed his hands at the blaze, “at his office, I","Great Expectations"
"expect?” I nodded. “Hah! I have heerd that my son is a wonderful hand","Great Expectations"
"at his business, sir?” I nodded hard. “Yes; so they tell me. His","Great Expectations"
"business is the Law?” I nodded harder. “Which makes it more surprising","Great Expectations"
"in my son,” said the old man, “for he was not brought up to the Law,","Great Expectations"
"but to the Wine-Coopering.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Curious to know how the old gentleman stood informed concerning the","Great Expectations"
"reputation of Mr. Jaggers, I roared that name at him. He threw me into","Great Expectations"
"the greatest confusion by laughing heartily and replying in a very","Great Expectations"
"sprightly manner, “No, to be sure; you’re right.” And to this hour I","Great Expectations"
"have not the faintest notion what he meant, or what joke he thought I","Great Expectations"
"had made.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As I could not sit there nodding at him perpetually, without making","Great Expectations"
"some other attempt to interest him, I shouted at inquiry whether his","Great Expectations"
"own calling in life had been “the Wine-Coopering.” By dint of straining","Great Expectations"
"that term out of myself several times and tapping the old gentleman on","Great Expectations"
"the chest to associate it with him, I at last succeeded in making my","Great Expectations"
"meaning understood.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No,” said the old gentleman; “the warehousing, the warehousing. First,","Great Expectations"
"over yonder;” he appeared to mean up the chimney, but I believe he","Great Expectations"
"intended to refer me to Liverpool; “and then in the City of London","Great Expectations"
"here. However, having an infirmity—for I am hard of hearing, sir—”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I expressed in pantomime the greatest astonishment.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“—Yes, hard of hearing; having that infirmity coming upon me, my son he","Great Expectations"
"went into the Law, and he took charge of me, and he by little and","Great Expectations"
"little made out this elegant and beautiful property. But returning to","Great Expectations"
"what you said, you know,” pursued the old man, again laughing heartily,","Great Expectations"
"“what I say is, No to be sure; you’re right.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I was modestly wondering whether my utmost ingenuity would have enabled","Great Expectations"
"me to say anything that would have amused him half as much as this","Great Expectations"
"imaginary pleasantry, when I was startled by a sudden click in the wall","Great Expectations"
"on one side of the chimney, and the ghostly tumbling open of a little","Great Expectations"
"wooden flap with “JOHN” upon it. The old man, following my eyes, cried","Great Expectations"
"with great triumph, “My son’s come home!” and we both went out to the","Great Expectations"
"drawbridge.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was worth any money to see Wemmick waving a salute to me from the","Great Expectations"
"other side of the moat, when we might have shaken hands across it with","Great Expectations"
"the greatest ease. The Aged was so delighted to work the drawbridge,","Great Expectations"
"that I made no offer to assist him, but stood quiet until Wemmick had","Great Expectations"
"come across, and had presented me to Miss Skiffins; a lady by whom he","Great Expectations"
"was accompanied.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Miss Skiffins was of a wooden appearance, and was, like her escort, in","Great Expectations"
"the post-office branch of the service. She might have been some two or","Great Expectations"
"three years younger than Wemmick, and I judged her to stand possessed","Great Expectations"
"of portable property. The cut of her dress from the waist upward, both","Great Expectations"
"before and behind, made her figure very like a boy’s kite; and I might","Great Expectations"
"have pronounced her gown a little too decidedly orange, and her gloves","Great Expectations"
"a little too intensely green. But she seemed to be a good sort of","Great Expectations"
"fellow, and showed a high regard for the Aged. I was not long in","Great Expectations"
"discovering that she was a frequent visitor at the Castle; for, on our","Great Expectations"
"going in, and my complimenting Wemmick on his ingenious contrivance for","Great Expectations"
"announcing himself to the Aged, he begged me to give my attention for a","Great Expectations"
"moment to the other side of the chimney, and disappeared. Presently","Great Expectations"
"another click came, and another little door tumbled open with “Miss","Great Expectations"
"Skiffins” on it; then Miss Skiffins shut up and John tumbled open; then","Great Expectations"
"Miss Skiffins and John both tumbled open together, and finally shut up","Great Expectations"
"together. On Wemmick’s return from working these mechanical appliances,","Great Expectations"
"I expressed the great admiration with which I regarded them, and he","Great Expectations"
"said, “Well, you know, they’re both pleasant and useful to the Aged.","Great Expectations"
"And by George, sir, it’s a thing worth mentioning, that of all the","Great Expectations"
"people who come to this gate, the secret of those pulls is only known","Great Expectations"
"to the Aged, Miss Skiffins, and me!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And Mr. Wemmick made them,” added Miss Skiffins, “with his own hands","Great Expectations"
"out of his own head.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"While Miss Skiffins was taking off her bonnet (she retained her green","Great Expectations"
"gloves during the evening as an outward and visible sign that there was","Great Expectations"
"company), Wemmick invited me to take a walk with him round the","Great Expectations"
"property, and see how the island looked in wintertime. Thinking that he","Great Expectations"
"did this to give me an opportunity of taking his Walworth sentiments, I","Great Expectations"
"seized the opportunity as soon as we were out of the Castle.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Having thought of the matter with care, I approached my subject as if I","Great Expectations"
"had never hinted at it before. I informed Wemmick that I was anxious in","Great Expectations"
"behalf of Herbert Pocket, and I told him how we had first met, and how","Great Expectations"
"we had fought. I glanced at Herbert’s home, and at his character, and","Great Expectations"
"at his having no means but such as he was dependent on his father for;","Great Expectations"
"those, uncertain and unpunctual. I alluded to the advantages I had","Great Expectations"
"derived in my first rawness and ignorance from his society, and I","Great Expectations"
"confessed that I feared I had but ill repaid them, and that he might","Great Expectations"
"have done better without me and my expectations. Keeping Miss Havisham","Great Expectations"
"in the background at a great distance, I still hinted at the","Great Expectations"
"possibility of my having competed with him in his prospects, and at the","Great Expectations"
"certainty of his possessing a generous soul, and being far above any","Great Expectations"
"mean distrusts, retaliations, or designs. For all these reasons (I told","Great Expectations"
"Wemmick), and because he was my young companion and friend, and I had a","Great Expectations"
"great affection for him, I wished my own good fortune to reflect some","Great Expectations"
"rays upon him, and therefore I sought advice from Wemmick’s experience","Great Expectations"
"and knowledge of men and affairs, how I could best try with my","Great Expectations"
"resources to help Herbert to some present income,—say of a hundred a","Great Expectations"
"year, to keep him in good hope and heart,—and gradually to buy him on","Great Expectations"
"to some small partnership. I begged Wemmick, in conclusion, to","Great Expectations"
"understand that my help must always be rendered without Herbert’s","Great Expectations"
"knowledge or suspicion, and that there was no one else in the world","Great Expectations"
"with whom I could advise. I wound up by laying my hand upon his","Great Expectations"
"shoulder, and saying, “I can’t help confiding in you, though I know it","Great Expectations"
"must be troublesome to you; but that is your fault, in having ever","Great Expectations"
"brought me here.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Wemmick was silent for a little while, and then said with a kind of","Great Expectations"
"start, “Well you know, Mr. Pip, I must tell you one thing. This is","Great Expectations"
"devilish good of you.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Say you’ll help me to be good then,” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Ecod,” replied Wemmick, shaking his head, “that’s not my trade.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Nor is this your trading-place,” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You are right,” he returned. “You hit the nail on the head. Mr. Pip,","Great Expectations"
"I’ll put on my considering-cap, and I think all you want to do may be","Great Expectations"
"done by degrees. Skiffins (that’s her brother) is an accountant and","Great Expectations"
"agent. I’ll look him up and go to work for you.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I thank you ten thousand times.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“On the contrary,” said he, “I thank you, for though we are strictly in","Great Expectations"
"our private and personal capacity, still it may be mentioned that there","Great Expectations"
"_are_ Newgate cobwebs about, and it brushes them away.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"After a little further conversation to the same effect, we returned","Great Expectations"
"into the Castle where we found Miss Skiffins preparing tea. The","Great Expectations"
"responsible duty of making the toast was delegated to the Aged, and","Great Expectations"
"that excellent old gentleman was so intent upon it that he seemed to me","Great Expectations"
"in some danger of melting his eyes. It was no nominal meal that we were","Great Expectations"
"going to make, but a vigorous reality. The Aged prepared such a","Great Expectations"
"hay-stack of buttered toast, that I could scarcely see him over it as","Great Expectations"
"it simmered on an iron stand hooked on to the top-bar; while Miss","Great Expectations"
"Skiffins brewed such a jorum of tea, that the pig in the back premises","Great Expectations"
"became strongly excited, and repeatedly expressed his desire to","Great Expectations"
"participate in the entertainment.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The flag had been struck, and the gun had been fired, at the right","Great Expectations"
"moment of time, and I felt as snugly cut off from the rest of Walworth","Great Expectations"
"as if the moat were thirty feet wide by as many deep. Nothing disturbed","Great Expectations"
"the tranquillity of the Castle, but the occasional tumbling open of","Great Expectations"
"John and Miss Skiffins: which little doors were a prey to some","Great Expectations"
"spasmodic infirmity that made me sympathetically uncomfortable until I","Great Expectations"
"got used to it. I inferred from the methodical nature of Miss","Great Expectations"
"Skiffins’s arrangements that she made tea there every Sunday night; and","Great Expectations"
"I rather suspected that a classic brooch she wore, representing the","Great Expectations"
"profile of an undesirable female with a very straight nose and a very","Great Expectations"
"new moon, was a piece of portable property that had been given her by","Great Expectations"
"Wemmick.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We ate the whole of the toast, and drank tea in proportion, and it was","Great Expectations"
"delightful to see how warm and greasy we all got after it. The Aged","Great Expectations"
"especially, might have passed for some clean old chief of a savage","Great Expectations"
"tribe, just oiled. After a short pause of repose, Miss Skiffins—in the","Great Expectations"
"absence of the little servant who, it seemed, retired to the bosom of","Great Expectations"
"her family on Sunday afternoons—washed up the tea-things, in a trifling","Great Expectations"
"lady-like amateur manner that compromised none of us. Then, she put on","Great Expectations"
"her gloves again, and we drew round the fire, and Wemmick said, “Now,","Great Expectations"
"Aged Parent, tip us the paper.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Wemmick explained to me while the Aged got his spectacles out, that","Great Expectations"
"this was according to custom, and that it gave the old gentleman","Great Expectations"
"infinite satisfaction to read the news aloud. “I won’t offer an","Great Expectations"
"apology,” said Wemmick, “for he isn’t capable of many pleasures—are","Great Expectations"
"you, Aged P.?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“All right, John, all right,” returned the old man, seeing himself","Great Expectations"
"spoken to.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Only tip him a nod every now and then when he looks off his paper,”","Great Expectations"
"said Wemmick, “and he’ll be as happy as a king. We are all attention,","Great Expectations"
"Aged One.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“All right, John, all right!” returned the cheerful old man, so busy","Great Expectations"
"and so pleased, that it really was quite charming.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The Aged’s reading reminded me of the classes at Mr. Wopsle’s","Great Expectations"
"great-aunt’s, with the pleasanter peculiarity that it seemed to come","Great Expectations"
"through a keyhole. As he wanted the candles close to him, and as he was","Great Expectations"
"always on the verge of putting either his head or the newspaper into","Great Expectations"
"them, he required as much watching as a powder-mill. But Wemmick was","Great Expectations"
"equally untiring and gentle in his vigilance, and the Aged read on,","Great Expectations"
"quite unconscious of his many rescues. Whenever he looked at us, we all","Great Expectations"
"expressed the greatest interest and amazement, and nodded until he","Great Expectations"
"resumed again.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As Wemmick and Miss Skiffins sat side by side, and as I sat in a","Great Expectations"
"shadowy corner, I observed a slow and gradual elongation of Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Wemmick’s mouth, powerfully suggestive of his slowly and gradually","Great Expectations"
"stealing his arm round Miss Skiffins’s waist. In course of time I saw","Great Expectations"
"his hand appear on the other side of Miss Skiffins; but at that moment","Great Expectations"
"Miss Skiffins neatly stopped him with the green glove, unwound his arm","Great Expectations"
"again as if it were an article of dress, and with the greatest","Great Expectations"
"deliberation laid it on the table before her. Miss Skiffins’s composure","Great Expectations"
"while she did this was one of the most remarkable sights I have ever","Great Expectations"
"seen, and if I could have thought the act consistent with abstraction","Great Expectations"
"of mind, I should have deemed that Miss Skiffins performed it","Great Expectations"
"mechanically.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"By and by, I noticed Wemmick’s arm beginning to disappear again, and","Great Expectations"
"gradually fading out of view. Shortly afterwards, his mouth began to","Great Expectations"
"widen again. After an interval of suspense on my part that was quite","Great Expectations"
"enthralling and almost painful, I saw his hand appear on the other side","Great Expectations"
"of Miss Skiffins. Instantly, Miss Skiffins stopped it with the neatness","Great Expectations"
"of a placid boxer, took off that girdle or cestus as before, and laid","Great Expectations"
"it on the table. Taking the table to represent the path of virtue, I am","Great Expectations"
"justified in stating that during the whole time of the Aged’s reading,","Great Expectations"
"Wemmick’s arm was straying from the path of virtue and being recalled","Great Expectations"
"to it by Miss Skiffins.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"At last, the Aged read himself into a light slumber. This was the time","Great Expectations"
"for Wemmick to produce a little kettle, a tray of glasses, and a black","Great Expectations"
"bottle with a porcelain-topped cork, representing some clerical","Great Expectations"
"dignitary of a rubicund and social aspect. With the aid of these","Great Expectations"
"appliances we all had something warm to drink, including the Aged, who","Great Expectations"
"was soon awake again. Miss Skiffins mixed, and I observed that she and","Great Expectations"
"Wemmick drank out of one glass. Of course I knew better than to offer","Great Expectations"
"to see Miss Skiffins home, and under the circumstances I thought I had","Great Expectations"
"best go first; which I did, taking a cordial leave of the Aged, and","Great Expectations"
"having passed a pleasant evening.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Before a week was out, I received a note from Wemmick, dated Walworth,","Great Expectations"
"stating that he hoped he had made some advance in that matter","Great Expectations"
"appertaining to our private and personal capacities, and that he would","Great Expectations"
"be glad if I could come and see him again upon it. So, I went out to","Great Expectations"
"Walworth again, and yet again, and yet again, and I saw him by","Great Expectations"
"appointment in the City several times, but never held any communication","Great Expectations"
"with him on the subject in or near Little Britain. The upshot was, that","Great Expectations"
"we found a worthy young merchant or shipping-broker, not long","Great Expectations"
"established in business, who wanted intelligent help, and who wanted","Great Expectations"
"capital, and who in due course of time and receipt would want a","Great Expectations"
"partner. Between him and me, secret articles were signed of which","Great Expectations"
"Herbert was the subject, and I paid him half of my five hundred pounds","Great Expectations"
"down, and engaged for sundry other payments: some, to fall due at","Great Expectations"
"certain dates out of my income: some, contingent on my coming into my","Great Expectations"
"property. Miss Skiffins’s brother conducted the negotiation. Wemmick","Great Expectations"
"pervaded it throughout, but never appeared in it.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The whole business was so cleverly managed, that Herbert had not the","Great Expectations"
"least suspicion of my hand being in it. I never shall forget the","Great Expectations"
"radiant face with which he came home one afternoon, and told me, as a","Great Expectations"
"mighty piece of news, of his having fallen in with one Clarriker (the","Great Expectations"
"young merchant’s name), and of Clarriker’s having shown an","Great Expectations"
"extraordinary inclination towards him, and of his belief that the","Great Expectations"
"opening had come at last. Day by day as his hopes grew stronger and his","Great Expectations"
"face brighter, he must have thought me a more and more affectionate","Great Expectations"
"friend, for I had the greatest difficulty in restraining my tears of","Great Expectations"
"triumph when I saw him so happy. At length, the thing being done, and","Great Expectations"
"he having that day entered Clarriker’s House, and he having talked to","Great Expectations"
"me for a whole evening in a flush of pleasure and success, I did really","Great Expectations"
"cry in good earnest when I went to bed, to think that my expectations","Great Expectations"
"had done some good to somebody.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"A great event in my life, the turning point of my life, now opens on my","Great Expectations"
"view. But, before I proceed to narrate it, and before I pass on to all","Great Expectations"
"the changes it involved, I must give one chapter to Estella. It is not","Great Expectations"
"much to give to the theme that so long filled my heart.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Chapter XXXVIII.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"If that staid old house near the Green at Richmond should ever come to","Great Expectations"
"be haunted when I am dead, it will be haunted, surely, by my ghost. O","Great Expectations"
"the many, many nights and days through which the unquiet spirit within","Great Expectations"
"me haunted that house when Estella lived there! Let my body be where it","Great Expectations"
"would, my spirit was always wandering, wandering, wandering, about that","Great Expectations"
"house.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The lady with whom Estella was placed, Mrs. Brandley by name, was a","Great Expectations"
"widow, with one daughter several years older than Estella. The mother","Great Expectations"
"looked young, and the daughter looked old; the mother’s complexion was","Great Expectations"
"pink, and the daughter’s was yellow; the mother set up for frivolity,","Great Expectations"
"and the daughter for theology. They were in what is called a good","Great Expectations"
"position, and visited, and were visited by, numbers of people. Little,","Great Expectations"
"if any, community of feeling subsisted between them and Estella, but","Great Expectations"
"the understanding was established that they were necessary to her, and","Great Expectations"
"that she was necessary to them. Mrs. Brandley had been a friend of Miss","Great Expectations"
"Havisham’s before the time of her seclusion.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"In Mrs. Brandley’s house and out of Mrs. Brandley’s house, I suffered","Great Expectations"
"every kind and degree of torture that Estella could cause me. The","Great Expectations"
"nature of my relations with her, which placed me on terms of","Great Expectations"
"familiarity without placing me on terms of favour, conduced to my","Great Expectations"
"distraction. She made use of me to tease other admirers, and she turned","Great Expectations"
"the very familiarity between herself and me to the account of putting a","Great Expectations"
"constant slight on my devotion to her. If I had been her secretary,","Great Expectations"
"steward, half-brother, poor relation,—if I had been a younger brother","Great Expectations"
"of her appointed husband,—I could not have seemed to myself further","Great Expectations"
"from my hopes when I was nearest to her. The privilege of calling her","Great Expectations"
"by her name and hearing her call me by mine became, under the","Great Expectations"
"circumstances an aggravation of my trials; and while I think it likely","Great Expectations"
"that it almost maddened her other lovers, I know too certainly that it","Great Expectations"
"almost maddened me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"She had admirers without end. No doubt my jealousy made an admirer of","Great Expectations"
"every one who went near her; but there were more than enough of them","Great Expectations"
"without that.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I saw her often at Richmond, I heard of her often in town, and I used","Great Expectations"
"often to take her and the Brandleys on the water; there were picnics,","Great Expectations"
"fête days, plays, operas, concerts, parties, all sorts of pleasures,","Great Expectations"
"through which I pursued her,—and they were all miseries to me. I never","Great Expectations"
"had one hour’s happiness in her society, and yet my mind all round the","Great Expectations"
"four-and-twenty hours was harping on the happiness of having her with","Great Expectations"
"me unto death.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Throughout this part of our intercourse,—and it lasted, as will","Great Expectations"
"presently be seen, for what I then thought a long time,—she habitually","Great Expectations"
"reverted to that tone which expressed that our association was forced","Great Expectations"
"upon us. There were other times when she would come to a sudden check","Great Expectations"
"in this tone and in all her many tones, and would seem to pity me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Pip, Pip,” she said one evening, coming to such a check, when we sat","Great Expectations"
"apart at a darkening window of the house in Richmond; “will you never","Great Expectations"
"take warning?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Of what?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Of me.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Warning not to be attracted by you, do you mean, Estella?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Do I mean! If you don’t know what I mean, you are blind.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I should have replied that Love was commonly reputed blind, but for the","Great Expectations"
"reason that I always was restrained—and this was not the least of my","Great Expectations"
"miseries—by a feeling that it was ungenerous to press myself upon her,","Great Expectations"
"when she knew that she could not choose but obey Miss Havisham. My","Great Expectations"
"dread always was, that this knowledge on her part laid me under a heavy","Great Expectations"
"disadvantage with her pride, and made me the subject of a rebellious","Great Expectations"
"struggle in her bosom.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“At any rate,” said I, “I have no warning given me just now, for you","Great Expectations"
"wrote to me to come to you, this time.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“That’s true,” said Estella, with a cold careless smile that always","Great Expectations"
"chilled me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"After looking at the twilight without, for a little while, she went on","Great Expectations"
"to say:—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“The time has come round when Miss Havisham wishes to have me for a day","Great Expectations"
"at Satis. You are to take me there, and bring me back, if you will. She","Great Expectations"
"would rather I did not travel alone, and objects to receiving my maid,","Great Expectations"
"for she has a sensitive horror of being talked of by such people. Can","Great Expectations"
"you take me?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Can I take you, Estella!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You can then? The day after to-morrow, if you please. You are to pay","Great Expectations"
"all charges out of my purse. You hear the condition of your going?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And must obey,” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"This was all the preparation I received for that visit, or for others","Great Expectations"
"like it; Miss Havisham never wrote to me, nor had I ever so much as","Great Expectations"
"seen her handwriting. We went down on the next day but one, and we","Great Expectations"
"found her in the room where I had first beheld her, and it is needless","Great Expectations"
"to add that there was no change in Satis House.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"She was even more dreadfully fond of Estella than she had been when I","Great Expectations"
"last saw them together; I repeat the word advisedly, for there was","Great Expectations"
"something positively dreadful in the energy of her looks and embraces.","Great Expectations"
"She hung upon Estella’s beauty, hung upon her words, hung upon her","Great Expectations"
"gestures, and sat mumbling her own trembling fingers while she looked","Great Expectations"
"at her, as though she were devouring the beautiful creature she had","Great Expectations"
"reared.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"From Estella she looked at me, with a searching glance that seemed to","Great Expectations"
"pry into my heart and probe its wounds. “How does she use you, Pip; how","Great Expectations"
"does she use you?” she asked me again, with her witch-like eagerness,","Great Expectations"
"even in Estella’s hearing. But, when we sat by her flickering fire at","Great Expectations"
"night, she was most weird; for then, keeping Estella’s hand drawn","Great Expectations"
"through her arm and clutched in her own hand, she extorted from her, by","Great Expectations"
"dint of referring back to what Estella had told her in her regular","Great Expectations"
"letters, the names and conditions of the men whom she had fascinated;","Great Expectations"
"and as Miss Havisham dwelt upon this roll, with the intensity of a mind","Great Expectations"
"mortally hurt and diseased, she sat with her other hand on her crutch","Great Expectations"
"stick, and her chin on that, and her wan bright eyes glaring at me, a","Great Expectations"
"very spectre.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I saw in this, wretched though it made me, and bitter the sense of","Great Expectations"
"dependence and even of degradation that it awakened,—I saw in this that","Great Expectations"
"Estella was set to wreak Miss Havisham’s revenge on men, and that she","Great Expectations"
"was not to be given to me until she had gratified it for a term. I saw","Great Expectations"
"in this, a reason for her being beforehand assigned to me. Sending her","Great Expectations"
"out to attract and torment and do mischief, Miss Havisham sent her with","Great Expectations"
"the malicious assurance that she was beyond the reach of all admirers,","Great Expectations"
"and that all who staked upon that cast were secured to lose. I saw in","Great Expectations"
"this that I, too, was tormented by a perversion of ingenuity, even","Great Expectations"
"while the prize was reserved for me. I saw in this the reason for my","Great Expectations"
"being staved off so long and the reason for my late guardian’s","Great Expectations"
"declining to commit himself to the formal knowledge of such a scheme.","Great Expectations"
"In a word, I saw in this Miss Havisham as I had her then and there","Great Expectations"
"before my eyes, and always had had her before my eyes; and I saw in","Great Expectations"
"this, the distinct shadow of the darkened and unhealthy house in which","Great Expectations"
"her life was hidden from the sun.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The candles that lighted that room of hers were placed in sconces on","Great Expectations"
"the wall. They were high from the ground, and they burnt with the","Great Expectations"
"steady dulness of artificial light in air that is seldom renewed. As I","Great Expectations"
"looked round at them, and at the pale gloom they made, and at the","Great Expectations"
"stopped clock, and at the withered articles of bridal dress upon the","Great Expectations"
"table and the ground, and at her own awful figure with its ghostly","Great Expectations"
"reflection thrown large by the fire upon the ceiling and the wall, I","Great Expectations"
"saw in everything the construction that my mind had come to, repeated","Great Expectations"
"and thrown back to me. My thoughts passed into the great room across","Great Expectations"
"the landing where the table was spread, and I saw it written, as it","Great Expectations"
"were, in the falls of the cobwebs from the centre-piece, in the","Great Expectations"
"crawlings of the spiders on the cloth, in the tracks of the mice as","Great Expectations"
"they betook their little quickened hearts behind the panels, and in the","Great Expectations"
"gropings and pausings of the beetles on the floor.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It happened on the occasion of this visit that some sharp words arose","Great Expectations"
"between Estella and Miss Havisham. It was the first time I had ever","Great Expectations"
"seen them opposed.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We were seated by the fire, as just now described, and Miss Havisham","Great Expectations"
"still had Estella’s arm drawn through her own, and still clutched","Great Expectations"
"Estella’s hand in hers, when Estella gradually began to detach herself.","Great Expectations"
"She had shown a proud impatience more than once before, and had rather","Great Expectations"
"endured that fierce affection than accepted or returned it.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What!” said Miss Havisham, flashing her eyes upon her, “are you tired","Great Expectations"
"of me?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Only a little tired of myself,” replied Estella, disengaging her arm,","Great Expectations"
"and moving to the great chimney-piece, where she stood looking down at","Great Expectations"
"the fire.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Speak the truth, you ingrate!” cried Miss Havisham, passionately","Great Expectations"
"striking her stick upon the floor; “you are tired of me.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Estella looked at her with perfect composure, and again looked down at","Great Expectations"
"the fire. Her graceful figure and her beautiful face expressed a","Great Expectations"
"self-possessed indifference to the wild heat of the other, that was","Great Expectations"
"almost cruel.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You stock and stone!” exclaimed Miss Havisham. “You cold, cold heart!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What?” said Estella, preserving her attitude of indifference as she","Great Expectations"
"leaned against the great chimney-piece and only moving her eyes; “do","Great Expectations"
"you reproach me for being cold? You?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Are you not?” was the fierce retort.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You should know,” said Estella. “I am what you have made me. Take all","Great Expectations"
"the praise, take all the blame; take all the success, take all the","Great Expectations"
"failure; in short, take me.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“O, look at her, look at her!” cried Miss Havisham, bitterly; “Look at","Great Expectations"
"her so hard and thankless, on the hearth where she was reared! Where I","Great Expectations"
"took her into this wretched breast when it was first bleeding from its","Great Expectations"
"stabs, and where I have lavished years of tenderness upon her!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"[Illustration]","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“At least I was no party to the compact,” said Estella, “for if I could","Great Expectations"
"walk and speak, when it was made, it was as much as I could do. But","Great Expectations"
"what would you have? You have been very good to me, and I owe","Great Expectations"
"everything to you. What would you have?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Love,” replied the other.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You have it.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I have not,” said Miss Havisham.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Mother by adoption,” retorted Estella, never departing from the easy","Great Expectations"
"grace of her attitude, never raising her voice as the other did, never","Great Expectations"
"yielding either to anger or tenderness,—“mother by adoption, I have","Great Expectations"
"said that I owe everything to you. All I possess is freely yours. All","Great Expectations"
"that you have given me, is at your command to have again. Beyond that,","Great Expectations"
"I have nothing. And if you ask me to give you, what you never gave me,","Great Expectations"
"my gratitude and duty cannot do impossibilities.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Did I never give her love!” cried Miss Havisham, turning wildly to me.","Great Expectations"
"“Did I never give her a burning love, inseparable from jealousy at all","Great Expectations"
"times, and from sharp pain, while she speaks thus to me! Let her call","Great Expectations"
"me mad, let her call me mad!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Why should I call you mad,” returned Estella, “I, of all people? Does","Great Expectations"
"any one live, who knows what set purposes you have, half as well as I","Great Expectations"
"do? Does any one live, who knows what a steady memory you have, half as","Great Expectations"
"well as I do? I who have sat on this same hearth on the little stool","Great Expectations"
"that is even now beside you there, learning your lessons and looking up","Great Expectations"
"into your face, when your face was strange and frightened me!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Soon forgotten!” moaned Miss Havisham. “Times soon forgotten!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No, not forgotten,” retorted Estella,—“not forgotten, but treasured up","Great Expectations"
"in my memory. When have you found me false to your teaching? When have","Great Expectations"
"you found me unmindful of your lessons? When have you found me giving","Great Expectations"
"admission here,” she touched her bosom with her hand, “to anything that","Great Expectations"
"you excluded? Be just to me.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“So proud, so proud!” moaned Miss Havisham, pushing away her grey hair","Great Expectations"
"with both her hands.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Who taught me to be proud?” returned Estella. “Who praised me when I","Great Expectations"
"learnt my lesson?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“So hard, so hard!” moaned Miss Havisham, with her former action.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Who taught me to be hard?” returned Estella. “Who praised me when I","Great Expectations"
"learnt my lesson?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“But to be proud and hard to _me_!” Miss Havisham quite shrieked, as","Great Expectations"
"she stretched out her arms. “Estella, Estella, Estella, to be proud and","Great Expectations"
"hard to _me_!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Estella looked at her for a moment with a kind of calm wonder, but was","Great Expectations"
"not otherwise disturbed; when the moment was past, she looked down at","Great Expectations"
"the fire again.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I cannot think,” said Estella, raising her eyes after a silence “why","Great Expectations"
"you should be so unreasonable when I come to see you after a","Great Expectations"
"separation. I have never forgotten your wrongs and their causes. I have","Great Expectations"
"never been unfaithful to you or your schooling. I have never shown any","Great Expectations"
"weakness that I can charge myself with.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Would it be weakness to return my love?” exclaimed Miss Havisham. “But","Great Expectations"
"yes, yes, she would call it so!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I begin to think,” said Estella, in a musing way, after another moment","Great Expectations"
"of calm wonder, “that I almost understand how this comes about. If you","Great Expectations"
"had brought up your adopted daughter wholly in the dark confinement of","Great Expectations"
"these rooms, and had never let her know that there was such a thing as","Great Expectations"
"the daylight by which she had never once seen your face,—if you had","Great Expectations"
"done that, and then, for a purpose had wanted her to understand the","Great Expectations"
"daylight and know all about it, you would have been disappointed and","Great Expectations"
"angry?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Miss Havisham, with her head in her hands, sat making a low moaning,","Great Expectations"
"and swaying herself on her chair, but gave no answer.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Or,” said Estella,—“which is a nearer case,—if you had taught her,","Great Expectations"
"from the dawn of her intelligence, with your utmost energy and might,","Great Expectations"
"that there was such a thing as daylight, but that it was made to be her","Great Expectations"
"enemy and destroyer, and she must always turn against it, for it had","Great Expectations"
"blighted you and would else blight her;—if you had done this, and then,","Great Expectations"
"for a purpose, had wanted her to take naturally to the daylight and she","Great Expectations"
"could not do it, you would have been disappointed and angry?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Miss Havisham sat listening (or it seemed so, for I could not see her","Great Expectations"
"face), but still made no answer.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“So,” said Estella, “I must be taken as I have been made. The success","Great Expectations"
"is not mine, the failure is not mine, but the two together make me.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Miss Havisham had settled down, I hardly knew how, upon the floor,","Great Expectations"
"among the faded bridal relics with which it was strewn. I took","Great Expectations"
"advantage of the moment—I had sought one from the first—to leave the","Great Expectations"
"room, after beseeching Estella’s attention to her, with a movement of","Great Expectations"
"my hand. When I left, Estella was yet standing by the great","Great Expectations"
"chimney-piece, just as she had stood throughout. Miss Havisham’s grey","Great Expectations"
"hair was all adrift upon the ground, among the other bridal wrecks, and","Great Expectations"
"was a miserable sight to see.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was with a depressed heart that I walked in the starlight for an","Great Expectations"
"hour and more, about the courtyard, and about the brewery, and about","Great Expectations"
"the ruined garden. When I at last took courage to return to the room, I","Great Expectations"
"found Estella sitting at Miss Havisham’s knee, taking up some stitches","Great Expectations"
"in one of those old articles of dress that were dropping to pieces, and","Great Expectations"
"of which I have often been reminded since by the faded tatters of old","Great Expectations"
"banners that I have seen hanging up in cathedrals. Afterwards, Estella","Great Expectations"
"and I played at cards, as of yore,—only we were skilful now, and played","Great Expectations"
"French games,—and so the evening wore away, and I went to bed.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I lay in that separate building across the courtyard. It was the first","Great Expectations"
"time I had ever lain down to rest in Satis House, and sleep refused to","Great Expectations"
"come near me. A thousand Miss Havishams haunted me. She was on this","Great Expectations"
"side of my pillow, on that, at the head of the bed, at the foot, behind","Great Expectations"
"the half-opened door of the dressing-room, in the dressing-room, in the","Great Expectations"
"room overhead, in the room beneath,—everywhere. At last, when the night","Great Expectations"
"was slow to creep on towards two o’clock, I felt that I absolutely","Great Expectations"
"could no longer bear the place as a place to lie down in, and that I","Great Expectations"
"must get up. I therefore got up and put on my clothes, and went out","Great Expectations"
"across the yard into the long stone passage, designing to gain the","Great Expectations"
"outer courtyard and walk there for the relief of my mind. But I was no","Great Expectations"
"sooner in the passage than I extinguished my candle; for I saw Miss","Great Expectations"
"Havisham going along it in a ghostly manner, making a low cry. I","Great Expectations"
"followed her at a distance, and saw her go up the staircase. She","Great Expectations"
"carried a bare candle in her hand, which she had probably taken from","Great Expectations"
"one of the sconces in her own room, and was a most unearthly object by","Great Expectations"
"its light. Standing at the bottom of the staircase, I felt the mildewed","Great Expectations"
"air of the feast-chamber, without seeing her open the door, and I heard","Great Expectations"
"her walking there, and so across into her own room, and so across again","Great Expectations"
"into that, never ceasing the low cry. After a time, I tried in the dark","Great Expectations"
"both to get out, and to go back, but I could do neither until some","Great Expectations"
"streaks of day strayed in and showed me where to lay my hands. During","Great Expectations"
"the whole interval, whenever I went to the bottom of the staircase, I","Great Expectations"
"heard her footstep, saw her light pass above, and heard her ceaseless","Great Expectations"
"low cry.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Before we left next day, there was no revival of the difference between","Great Expectations"
"her and Estella, nor was it ever revived on any similar occasion; and","Great Expectations"
"there were four similar occasions, to the best of my remembrance. Nor,","Great Expectations"
"did Miss Havisham’s manner towards Estella in anywise change, except","Great Expectations"
"that I believed it to have something like fear infused among its former","Great Expectations"
"characteristics.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It is impossible to turn this leaf of my life, without putting Bentley","Great Expectations"
"Drummle’s name upon it; or I would, very gladly.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"On a certain occasion when the Finches were assembled in force, and","Great Expectations"
"when good feeling was being promoted in the usual manner by nobody’s","Great Expectations"
"agreeing with anybody else, the presiding Finch called the Grove to","Great Expectations"
"order, forasmuch as Mr. Drummle had not yet toasted a lady; which,","Great Expectations"
"according to the solemn constitution of the society, it was the brute’s","Great Expectations"
"turn to do that day. I thought I saw him leer in an ugly way at me","Great Expectations"
"while the decanters were going round, but as there was no love lost","Great Expectations"
"between us, that might easily be. What was my indignant surprise when","Great Expectations"
"he called upon the company to pledge him to “Estella!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Estella who?” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Never you mind,” retorted Drummle.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Estella of where?” said I. “You are bound to say of where.” Which he","Great Expectations"
"was, as a Finch.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Of Richmond, gentlemen,” said Drummle, putting me out of the question,","Great Expectations"
"“and a peerless beauty.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Much he knew about peerless beauties, a mean, miserable idiot! I","Great Expectations"
"whispered Herbert.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I know that lady,” said Herbert, across the table, when the toast had","Great Expectations"
"been honoured.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“_Do_ you?” said Drummle.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And so do I,” I added, with a scarlet face.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“_Do_ you?” said Drummle. “_O_, Lord!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"This was the only retort—except glass or crockery—that the heavy","Great Expectations"
"creature was capable of making; but, I became as highly incensed by it","Great Expectations"
"as if it had been barbed with wit, and I immediately rose in my place","Great Expectations"
"and said that I could not but regard it as being like the honourable","Great Expectations"
"Finch’s impudence to come down to that Grove,—we always talked about","Great Expectations"
"coming down to that Grove, as a neat Parliamentary turn of","Great Expectations"
"expression,—down to that Grove, proposing a lady of whom he knew","Great Expectations"
"nothing. Mr. Drummle, upon this, starting up, demanded what I meant by","Great Expectations"
"that? Whereupon I made him the extreme reply that I believed he knew","Great Expectations"
"where I was to be found.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Whether it was possible in a Christian country to get on without blood,","Great Expectations"
"after this, was a question on which the Finches were divided. The","Great Expectations"
"debate upon it grew so lively, indeed, that at least six more","Great Expectations"
"honourable members told six more, during the discussion, that they","Great Expectations"
"believed _they_ knew where _they_ were to be found. However, it was","Great Expectations"
"decided at last (the Grove being a Court of Honour) that if Mr. Drummle","Great Expectations"
"would bring never so slight a certificate from the lady, importing that","Great Expectations"
"he had the honour of her acquaintance, Mr. Pip must express his regret,","Great Expectations"
"as a gentleman and a Finch, for “having been betrayed into a warmth","Great Expectations"
"which.” Next day was appointed for the production (lest our honour","Great Expectations"
"should take cold from delay), and next day Drummle appeared with a","Great Expectations"
"polite little avowal in Estella’s hand, that she had had the honour of","Great Expectations"
"dancing with him several times. This left me no course but to regret","Great Expectations"
"that I had been “betrayed into a warmth which,” and on the whole to","Great Expectations"
"repudiate, as untenable, the idea that I was to be found anywhere.","Great Expectations"
"Drummle and I then sat snorting at one another for an hour, while the","Great Expectations"
"Grove engaged in indiscriminate contradiction, and finally the","Great Expectations"
"promotion of good feeling was declared to have gone ahead at an amazing","Great Expectations"
"rate.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I tell this lightly, but it was no light thing to me. For, I cannot","Great Expectations"
"adequately express what pain it gave me to think that Estella should","Great Expectations"
"show any favour to a contemptible, clumsy, sulky booby, so very far","Great Expectations"
"below the average. To the present moment, I believe it to have been","Great Expectations"
"referable to some pure fire of generosity and disinterestedness in my","Great Expectations"
"love for her, that I could not endure the thought of her stooping to","Great Expectations"
"that hound. No doubt I should have been miserable whomsoever she had","Great Expectations"
"favoured; but a worthier object would have caused me a different kind","Great Expectations"
"and degree of distress.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was easy for me to find out, and I did soon find out, that Drummle","Great Expectations"
"had begun to follow her closely, and that she allowed him to do it. A","Great Expectations"
"little while, and he was always in pursuit of her, and he and I crossed","Great Expectations"
"one another every day. He held on, in a dull persistent way, and","Great Expectations"
"Estella held him on; now with encouragement, now with discouragement,","Great Expectations"
"now almost flattering him, now openly despising him, now knowing him","Great Expectations"
"very well, now scarcely remembering who he was.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The Spider, as Mr. Jaggers had called him, was used to lying in wait,","Great Expectations"
"however, and had the patience of his tribe. Added to that, he had a","Great Expectations"
"blockhead confidence in his money and in his family greatness, which","Great Expectations"
"sometimes did him good service,—almost taking the place of","Great Expectations"
"concentration and determined purpose. So, the Spider, doggedly watching","Great Expectations"
"Estella, outwatched many brighter insects, and would often uncoil","Great Expectations"
"himself and drop at the right nick of time.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"At a certain Assembly Ball at Richmond (there used to be Assembly Balls","Great Expectations"
"at most places then), where Estella had outshone all other beauties,","Great Expectations"
"this blundering Drummle so hung about her, and with so much toleration","Great Expectations"
"on her part, that I resolved to speak to her concerning him. I took the","Great Expectations"
"next opportunity; which was when she was waiting for Mrs. Blandley to","Great Expectations"
"take her home, and was sitting apart among some flowers, ready to go. I","Great Expectations"
"was with her, for I almost always accompanied them to and from such","Great Expectations"
"places.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Are you tired, Estella?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Rather, Pip.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You should be.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Say rather, I should not be; for I have my letter to Satis House to","Great Expectations"
"write, before I go to sleep.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Recounting to-night’s triumph?” said I. “Surely a very poor one,","Great Expectations"
"Estella.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What do you mean? I didn’t know there had been any.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Estella,” said I, “do look at that fellow in the corner yonder, who is","Great Expectations"
"looking over here at us.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Why should I look at him?” returned Estella, with her eyes on me","Great Expectations"
"instead. “What is there in that fellow in the corner yonder,—to use","Great Expectations"
"your words,—that I need look at?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Indeed, that is the very question I want to ask you,” said I. “For he","Great Expectations"
"has been hovering about you all night.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Moths, and all sorts of ugly creatures,” replied Estella, with a","Great Expectations"
"glance towards him, “hover about a lighted candle. Can the candle help","Great Expectations"
"it?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No,” I returned; “but cannot the Estella help it?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well!” said she, laughing, after a moment, “perhaps. Yes. Anything you","Great Expectations"
"like.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“But, Estella, do hear me speak. It makes me wretched that you should","Great Expectations"
"encourage a man so generally despised as Drummle. You know he is","Great Expectations"
"despised.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well?” said she.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You know he is as ungainly within as without. A deficient,","Great Expectations"
"ill-tempered, lowering, stupid fellow.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well?” said she.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You know he has nothing to recommend him but money and a ridiculous","Great Expectations"
"roll of addle-headed predecessors; now, don’t you?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well?” said she again; and each time she said it, she opened her","Great Expectations"
"lovely eyes the wider.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"To overcome the difficulty of getting past that monosyllable, I took it","Great Expectations"
"from her, and said, repeating it with emphasis, “Well! Then, that is","Great Expectations"
"why it makes me wretched.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Now, if I could have believed that she favoured Drummle with any idea","Great Expectations"
"of making me—me—wretched, I should have been in better heart about it;","Great Expectations"
"but in that habitual way of hers, she put me so entirely out of the","Great Expectations"
"question, that I could believe nothing of the kind.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Pip,” said Estella, casting her glance over the room, “don’t be","Great Expectations"
"foolish about its effect on you. It may have its effect on others, and","Great Expectations"
"may be meant to have. It’s not worth discussing.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes it is,” said I, “because I cannot bear that people should say,","Great Expectations"
"‘she throws away her graces and attractions on a mere boor, the lowest","Great Expectations"
"in the crowd.’”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I can bear it,” said Estella.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Oh! don’t be so proud, Estella, and so inflexible.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Calls me proud and inflexible in this breath!” said Estella, opening","Great Expectations"
"her hands. “And in his last breath reproached me for stooping to a","Great Expectations"
"boor!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“There is no doubt you do,” said I, something hurriedly, “for I have","Great Expectations"
"seen you give him looks and smiles this very night, such as you never","Great Expectations"
"give to—me.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Do you want me then,” said Estella, turning suddenly with a fixed and","Great Expectations"
"serious, if not angry, look, “to deceive and entrap you?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Do you deceive and entrap him, Estella?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, and many others,—all of them but you. Here is Mrs. Brandley. I’ll","Great Expectations"
"say no more.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"And now that I have given the one chapter to the theme that so filled","Great Expectations"
"my heart, and so often made it ache and ache again, I pass on","Great Expectations"
"unhindered, to the event that had impended over me longer yet; the","Great Expectations"
"event that had begun to be prepared for, before I knew that the world","Great Expectations"
"held Estella, and in the days when her baby intelligence was receiving","Great Expectations"
"its first distortions from Miss Havisham’s wasting hands.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"In the Eastern story, the heavy slab that was to fall on the bed of","Great Expectations"
"state in the flush of conquest was slowly wrought out of the quarry,","Great Expectations"
"the tunnel for the rope to hold it in its place was slowly carried","Great Expectations"
"through the leagues of rock, the slab was slowly raised and fitted in","Great Expectations"
"the roof, the rope was rove to it and slowly taken through the miles of","Great Expectations"
"hollow to the great iron ring. All being made ready with much labour,","Great Expectations"
"and the hour come, the sultan was aroused in the dead of the night, and","Great Expectations"
"the sharpened axe that was to sever the rope from the great iron ring","Great Expectations"
"was put into his hand, and he struck with it, and the rope parted and","Great Expectations"
"rushed away, and the ceiling fell. So, in my case; all the work, near","Great Expectations"
"and afar, that tended to the end, had been accomplished; and in an","Great Expectations"
"instant the blow was struck, and the roof of my stronghold dropped upon","Great Expectations"
"me.","Great Expectations"

"","Great Expectations"
"Chapter XXXIX.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I was three-and-twenty years of age. Not another word had I heard to","Great Expectations"
"enlighten me on the subject of my expectations, and my twenty-third","Great Expectations"
"birthday was a week gone. We had left Barnard’s Inn more than a year,","Great Expectations"
"and lived in the Temple. Our chambers were in Garden-court, down by the","Great Expectations"
"river.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Pocket and I had for some time parted company as to our original","Great Expectations"
"relations, though we continued on the best terms. Notwithstanding my","Great Expectations"
"inability to settle to anything,—which I hope arose out of the restless","Great Expectations"
"and incomplete tenure on which I held my means,—I had a taste for","Great Expectations"
"reading, and read regularly so many hours a day. That matter of","Great Expectations"
"Herbert’s was still progressing, and everything with me was as I have","Great Expectations"
"brought it down to the close of the last preceding chapter.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Business had taken Herbert on a journey to Marseilles. I was alone, and","Great Expectations"
"had a dull sense of being alone. Dispirited and anxious, long hoping","Great Expectations"
"that to-morrow or next week would clear my way, and long disappointed,","Great Expectations"
"I sadly missed the cheerful face and ready response of my friend.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was wretched weather; stormy and wet, stormy and wet; and mud, mud,","Great Expectations"
"mud, deep in all the streets. Day after day, a vast heavy veil had been","Great Expectations"
"driving over London from the East, and it drove still, as if in the","Great Expectations"
"East there were an eternity of cloud and wind. So furious had been the","Great Expectations"
"gusts, that high buildings in town had had the lead stripped off their","Great Expectations"
"roofs; and in the country, trees had been torn up, and sails of","Great Expectations"
"windmills carried away; and gloomy accounts had come in from the coast,","Great Expectations"
"of shipwreck and death. Violent blasts of rain had accompanied these","Great Expectations"
"rages of wind, and the day just closed as I sat down to read had been","Great Expectations"
"the worst of all.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Alterations have been made in that part of the Temple since that time,","Great Expectations"
"and it has not now so lonely a character as it had then, nor is it so","Great Expectations"
"exposed to the river. We lived at the top of the last house, and the","Great Expectations"
"wind rushing up the river shook the house that night, like discharges","Great Expectations"
"of cannon, or breakings of a sea. When the rain came with it and dashed","Great Expectations"
"against the windows, I thought, raising my eyes to them as they rocked,","Great Expectations"
"that I might have fancied myself in a storm-beaten lighthouse.","Great Expectations"
"Occasionally, the smoke came rolling down the chimney as though it","Great Expectations"
"could not bear to go out into such a night; and when I set the doors","Great Expectations"
"open and looked down the staircase, the staircase lamps were blown out;","Great Expectations"
"and when I shaded my face with my hands and looked through the black","Great Expectations"
"windows (opening them ever so little was out of the question in the","Great Expectations"
"teeth of such wind and rain), I saw that the lamps in the court were","Great Expectations"
"blown out, and that the lamps on the bridges and the shore were","Great Expectations"
"shuddering, and that the coal-fires in barges on the river were being","Great Expectations"
"carried away before the wind like red-hot splashes in the rain.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I read with my watch upon the table, purposing to close my book at","Great Expectations"
"eleven o’clock. As I shut it, Saint Paul’s, and all the many","Great Expectations"
"church-clocks in the City—some leading, some accompanying, some","Great Expectations"
"following—struck that hour. The sound was curiously flawed by the wind;","Great Expectations"
"and I was listening, and thinking how the wind assailed and tore it,","Great Expectations"
"when I heard a footstep on the stair.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"What nervous folly made me start, and awfully connect it with the","Great Expectations"
"footstep of my dead sister, matters not. It was past in a moment, and I","Great Expectations"
"listened again, and heard the footstep stumble in coming on.","Great Expectations"
"Remembering then, that the staircase-lights were blown out, I took up","Great Expectations"
"my reading-lamp and went out to the stair-head. Whoever was below had","Great Expectations"
"stopped on seeing my lamp, for all was quiet.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“There is some one down there, is there not?” I called out, looking","Great Expectations"
"down.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes,” said a voice from the darkness beneath.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What floor do you want?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“The top. Mr. Pip.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“That is my name.—There is nothing the matter?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Nothing the matter,” returned the voice. And the man came on.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I stood with my lamp held out over the stair-rail, and he came slowly","Great Expectations"
"within its light. It was a shaded lamp, to shine upon a book, and its","Great Expectations"
"circle of light was very contracted; so that he was in it for a mere","Great Expectations"
"instant, and then out of it. In the instant, I had seen a face that was","Great Expectations"
"strange to me, looking up with an incomprehensible air of being touched","Great Expectations"
"and pleased by the sight of me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Moving the lamp as the man moved, I made out that he was substantially","Great Expectations"
"dressed, but roughly, like a voyager by sea. That he had long iron-grey","Great Expectations"
"hair. That his age was about sixty. That he was a muscular man, strong","Great Expectations"
"on his legs, and that he was browned and hardened by exposure to","Great Expectations"
"weather. As he ascended the last stair or two, and the light of my lamp","Great Expectations"
"included us both, I saw, with a stupid kind of amazement, that he was","Great Expectations"
"holding out both his hands to me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Pray what is your business?” I asked him.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“My business?” he repeated, pausing. “Ah! Yes. I will explain my","Great Expectations"
"business, by your leave.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Do you wish to come in?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes,” he replied; “I wish to come in, master.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I had asked him the question inhospitably enough, for I resented the","Great Expectations"
"sort of bright and gratified recognition that still shone in his face.","Great Expectations"
"I resented it, because it seemed to imply that he expected me to","Great Expectations"
"respond to it. But I took him into the room I had just left, and,","Great Expectations"
"having set the lamp on the table, asked him as civilly as I could to","Great Expectations"
"explain himself.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He looked about him with the strangest air,—an air of wondering","Great Expectations"
"pleasure, as if he had some part in the things he admired,—and he","Great Expectations"
"pulled off a rough outer coat, and his hat. Then, I saw that his head","Great Expectations"
"was furrowed and bald, and that the long iron-grey hair grew only on","Great Expectations"
"its sides. But, I saw nothing that in the least explained him. On the","Great Expectations"
"contrary, I saw him next moment, once more holding out both his hands","Great Expectations"
"to me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What do you mean?” said I, half suspecting him to be mad.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He stopped in his looking at me, and slowly rubbed his right hand over","Great Expectations"
"his head. “It’s disapinting to a man,” he said, in a coarse broken","Great Expectations"
"voice, “arter having looked for’ard so distant, and come so fur; but","Great Expectations"
"you’re not to blame for that,—neither on us is to blame for that. I’ll","Great Expectations"
"speak in half a minute. Give me half a minute, please.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He sat down on a chair that stood before the fire, and covered his","Great Expectations"
"forehead with his large brown veinous hands. I looked at him","Great Expectations"
"attentively then, and recoiled a little from him; but I did not know","Great Expectations"
"him.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“There’s no one nigh,” said he, looking over his shoulder; “is there?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Why do you, a stranger coming into my rooms at this time of the night,","Great Expectations"
"ask that question?” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You’re a game one,” he returned, shaking his head at me with a","Great Expectations"
"deliberate affection, at once most unintelligible and most","Great Expectations"
"exasperating; “I’m glad you’ve grow’d up, a game one! But don’t catch","Great Expectations"
"hold of me. You’d be sorry arterwards to have done it.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I relinquished the intention he had detected, for I knew him! Even yet","Great Expectations"
"I could not recall a single feature, but I knew him! If the wind and","Great Expectations"
"the rain had driven away the intervening years, had scattered all the","Great Expectations"
"intervening objects, had swept us to the churchyard where we first","Great Expectations"
"stood face to face on such different levels, I could not have known my","Great Expectations"
"convict more distinctly than I knew him now as he sat in the chair","Great Expectations"
"before the fire. No need to take a file from his pocket and show it to","Great Expectations"
"me; no need to take the handkerchief from his neck and twist it round","Great Expectations"
"his head; no need to hug himself with both his arms, and take a","Great Expectations"
"shivering turn across the room, looking back at me for recognition. I","Great Expectations"
"knew him before he gave me one of those aids, though, a moment before,","Great Expectations"
"I had not been conscious of remotely suspecting his identity.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He came back to where I stood, and again held out both his hands. Not","Great Expectations"
"knowing what to do,—for, in my astonishment I had lost my","Great Expectations"
"self-possession,—I reluctantly gave him my hands. He grasped them","Great Expectations"
"heartily, raised them to his lips, kissed them, and still held them.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You acted noble, my boy,” said he. “Noble, Pip! And I have never","Great Expectations"
"forgot it!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"At a change in his manner as if he were even going to embrace me, I","Great Expectations"
"laid a hand upon his breast and put him away.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Stay!” said I. “Keep off! If you are grateful to me for what I did","Great Expectations"
"when I was a little child, I hope you have shown your gratitude by","Great Expectations"
"mending your way of life. If you have come here to thank me, it was not","Great Expectations"
"necessary. Still, however you have found me out, there must be","Great Expectations"
"something good in the feeling that has brought you here, and I will not","Great Expectations"
"repulse you; but surely you must understand that—I—”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"My attention was so attracted by the singularity of his fixed look at","Great Expectations"
"me, that the words died away on my tongue.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You was a-saying,” he observed, when we had confronted one another in","Great Expectations"
"silence, “that surely I must understand. What, surely must I","Great Expectations"
"understand?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“That I cannot wish to renew that chance intercourse with you of long","Great Expectations"
"ago, under these different circumstances. I am glad to believe you have","Great Expectations"
"repented and recovered yourself. I am glad to tell you so. I am glad","Great Expectations"
"that, thinking I deserve to be thanked, you have come to thank me. But","Great Expectations"
"our ways are different ways, none the less. You are wet, and you look","Great Expectations"
"weary. Will you drink something before you go?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He had replaced his neckerchief loosely, and had stood, keenly","Great Expectations"
"observant of me, biting a long end of it. “I think,” he answered, still","Great Expectations"
"with the end at his mouth and still observant of me, “that I _will_","Great Expectations"
"drink (I thank you) afore I go.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"There was a tray ready on a side-table. I brought it to the table near","Great Expectations"
"the fire, and asked him what he would have? He touched one of the","Great Expectations"
"bottles without looking at it or speaking, and I made him some hot rum","Great Expectations"
"and water. I tried to keep my hand steady while I did so, but his look","Great Expectations"
"at me as he leaned back in his chair with the long draggled end of his","Great Expectations"
"neckerchief between his teeth—evidently forgotten—made my hand very","Great Expectations"
"difficult to master. When at last I put the glass to him, I saw with","Great Expectations"
"amazement that his eyes were full of tears.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Up to this time I had remained standing, not to disguise that I wished","Great Expectations"
"him gone. But I was softened by the softened aspect of the man, and","Great Expectations"
"felt a touch of reproach. “I hope,” said I, hurriedly putting something","Great Expectations"
"into a glass for myself, and drawing a chair to the table, “that you","Great Expectations"
"will not think I spoke harshly to you just now. I had no intention of","Great Expectations"
"doing it, and I am sorry for it if I did. I wish you well and happy!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As I put my glass to my lips, he glanced with surprise at the end of","Great Expectations"
"his neckerchief, dropping from his mouth when he opened it, and","Great Expectations"
"stretched out his hand. I gave him mine, and then he drank, and drew","Great Expectations"
"his sleeve across his eyes and forehead.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“How are you living?” I asked him.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I’ve been a sheep-farmer, stock-breeder, other trades besides, away in","Great Expectations"
"the new world,” said he; “many a thousand mile of stormy water off from","Great Expectations"
"this.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I hope you have done well?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I’ve done wonderfully well. There’s others went out alonger me as has","Great Expectations"
"done well too, but no man has done nigh as well as me. I’m famous for","Great Expectations"
"it.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I am glad to hear it.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I hope to hear you say so, my dear boy.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Without stopping to try to understand those words or the tone in which","Great Expectations"
"they were spoken, I turned off to a point that had just come into my","Great Expectations"
"mind.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Have you ever seen a messenger you once sent to me,” I inquired,","Great Expectations"
"“since he undertook that trust?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Never set eyes upon him. I warn’t likely to it.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“He came faithfully, and he brought me the two one-pound notes. I was a","Great Expectations"
"poor boy then, as you know, and to a poor boy they were a little","Great Expectations"
"fortune. But, like you, I have done well since, and you must let me pay","Great Expectations"
"them back. You can put them to some other poor boy’s use.” I took out","Great Expectations"
"my purse.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He watched me as I laid my purse upon the table and opened it, and he","Great Expectations"
"watched me as I separated two one-pound notes from its contents. They","Great Expectations"
"were clean and new, and I spread them out and handed them over to him.","Great Expectations"
"Still watching me, he laid them one upon the other, folded them","Great Expectations"
"long-wise, gave them a twist, set fire to them at the lamp, and dropped","Great Expectations"
"the ashes into the tray.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“May I make so bold,” he said then, with a smile that was like a frown,","Great Expectations"
"and with a frown that was like a smile, “as ask you _how_ you have done","Great Expectations"
"well, since you and me was out on them lone shivering marshes?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“How?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Ah!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He emptied his glass, got up, and stood at the side of the fire, with","Great Expectations"
"his heavy brown hand on the mantel-shelf. He put a foot up to the bars,","Great Expectations"
"to dry and warm it, and the wet boot began to steam; but, he neither","Great Expectations"
"looked at it, nor at the fire, but steadily looked at me. It was only","Great Expectations"
"now that I began to tremble.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"When my lips had parted, and had shaped some words that were without","Great Expectations"
"sound, I forced myself to tell him (though I could not do it","Great Expectations"
"distinctly), that I had been chosen to succeed to some property.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Might a mere warmint ask what property?” said he.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I faltered, “I don’t know.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Might a mere warmint ask whose property?” said he.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I faltered again, “I don’t know.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Could I make a guess, I wonder,” said the Convict, “at your income","Great Expectations"
"since you come of age! As to the first figure now. Five?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"With my heart beating like a heavy hammer of disordered action, I rose","Great Expectations"
"out of my chair, and stood with my hand upon the back of it, looking","Great Expectations"
"wildly at him.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Concerning a guardian,” he went on. “There ought to have been some","Great Expectations"
"guardian, or such-like, whiles you was a minor. Some lawyer, maybe. As","Great Expectations"
"to the first letter of that lawyer’s name now. Would it be J?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"All the truth of my position came flashing on me; and its","Great Expectations"
"disappointments, dangers, disgraces, consequences of all kinds, rushed","Great Expectations"
"in in such a multitude that I was borne down by them and had to","Great Expectations"
"struggle for every breath I drew.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Put it,” he resumed, “as the employer of that lawyer whose name begun","Great Expectations"
"with a J, and might be Jaggers,—put it as he had come over sea to","Great Expectations"
"Portsmouth, and had landed there, and had wanted to come on to you.","Great Expectations"
"‘However, you have found me out,’ you says just now. Well! However, did","Great Expectations"
"I find you out? Why, I wrote from Portsmouth to a person in London, for","Great Expectations"
"particulars of your address. That person’s name? Why, Wemmick.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I could not have spoken one word, though it had been to save my life. I","Great Expectations"
"stood, with a hand on the chair-back and a hand on my breast, where I","Great Expectations"
"seemed to be suffocating,—I stood so, looking wildly at him, until I","Great Expectations"
"grasped at the chair, when the room began to surge and turn. He caught","Great Expectations"
"me, drew me to the sofa, put me up against the cushions, and bent on","Great Expectations"
"one knee before me, bringing the face that I now well remembered, and","Great Expectations"
"that I shuddered at, very near to mine.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, Pip, dear boy, I’ve made a gentleman on you! It’s me wot has done","Great Expectations"
"it! I swore that time, sure as ever I earned a guinea, that guinea","Great Expectations"
"should go to you. I swore arterwards, sure as ever I spec’lated and got","Great Expectations"
"rich, you should get rich. I lived rough, that you should live smooth;","Great Expectations"
"I worked hard, that you should be above work. What odds, dear boy? Do I","Great Expectations"
"tell it, fur you to feel a obligation? Not a bit. I tell it, fur you to","Great Expectations"
"know as that there hunted dunghill dog wot you kep life in, got his","Great Expectations"
"head so high that he could make a gentleman,—and, Pip, you’re him!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The abhorrence in which I held the man, the dread I had of him, the","Great Expectations"
"repugnance with which I shrank from him, could not have been exceeded","Great Expectations"
"if he had been some terrible beast.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Look’ee here, Pip. I’m your second father. You’re my son,—more to me","Great Expectations"
"nor any son. I’ve put away money, only for you to spend. When I was a","Great Expectations"
"hired-out shepherd in a solitary hut, not seeing no faces but faces of","Great Expectations"
"sheep till I half forgot wot men’s and women’s faces wos like, I see","Great Expectations"
"yourn. I drops my knife many a time in that hut when I was a-eating my","Great Expectations"
"dinner or my supper, and I says, ‘Here’s the boy again, a looking at me","Great Expectations"
"whiles I eats and drinks!’ I see you there a many times, as plain as","Great Expectations"
"ever I see you on them misty marshes. ‘Lord strike me dead!’ I says","Great Expectations"
"each time,—and I goes out in the air to say it under the open","Great Expectations"
"heavens,—‘but wot, if I gets liberty and money, I’ll make that boy a","Great Expectations"
"gentleman!’ And I done it. Why, look at you, dear boy! Look at these","Great Expectations"
"here lodgings of yourn, fit for a lord! A lord? Ah! You shall show","Great Expectations"
"money with lords for wagers, and beat ’em!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"In his heat and triumph, and in his knowledge that I had been nearly","Great Expectations"
"fainting, he did not remark on my reception of all this. It was the one","Great Expectations"
"grain of relief I had.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Look’ee here!” he went on, taking my watch out of my pocket, and","Great Expectations"
"turning towards him a ring on my finger, while I recoiled from his","Great Expectations"
"touch as if he had been a snake, “a gold ’un and a beauty: _that’s_ a","Great Expectations"
"gentleman’s, I hope! A diamond all set round with rubies; _that’s_ a","Great Expectations"
"gentleman’s, I hope! Look at your linen; fine and beautiful! Look at","Great Expectations"
"your clothes; better ain’t to be got! And your books too,” turning his","Great Expectations"
"eyes round the room, “mounting up, on their shelves, by hundreds! And","Great Expectations"
"you read ’em; don’t you? I see you’d been a reading of ’em when I come","Great Expectations"
"in. Ha, ha, ha! You shall read ’em to me, dear boy! And if they’re in","Great Expectations"
"foreign languages wot I don’t understand, I shall be just as proud as","Great Expectations"
"if I did.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Again he took both my hands and put them to his lips, while my blood","Great Expectations"
"ran cold within me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Don’t you mind talking, Pip,” said he, after again drawing his sleeve","Great Expectations"
"over his eyes and forehead, as the click came in his throat which I","Great Expectations"
"well remembered,—and he was all the more horrible to me that he was so","Great Expectations"
"much in earnest; “you can’t do better nor keep quiet, dear boy. You","Great Expectations"
"ain’t looked slowly forward to this as I have; you wosn’t prepared for","Great Expectations"
"this as I wos. But didn’t you never think it might be me?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“O no, no, no,” I returned, “Never, never!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well, you see it _wos_ me, and single-handed. Never a soul in it but","Great Expectations"
"my own self and Mr. Jaggers.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Was there no one else?” I asked.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No,” said he, with a glance of surprise: “who else should there be?","Great Expectations"
"And, dear boy, how good looking you have growed! There’s bright eyes","Great Expectations"
"somewheres—eh? Isn’t there bright eyes somewheres, wot you love the","Great Expectations"
"thoughts on?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"O Estella, Estella!","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“They shall be yourn, dear boy, if money can buy ’em. Not that a","Great Expectations"
"gentleman like you, so well set up as you, can’t win ’em off of his own","Great Expectations"
"game; but money shall back you! Let me finish wot I was a telling you,","Great Expectations"
"dear boy. From that there hut and that there hiring-out, I got money","Great Expectations"
"left me by my master (which died, and had been the same as me), and got","Great Expectations"
"my liberty and went for myself. In every single thing I went for, I","Great Expectations"
"went for you. ‘Lord strike a blight upon it,’ I says, wotever it was I","Great Expectations"
"went for, ‘if it ain’t for him!’ It all prospered wonderful. As I giv’","Great Expectations"
"you to understand just now, I’m famous for it. It was the money left","Great Expectations"
"me, and the gains of the first few year wot I sent home to Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Jaggers—all for you—when he first come arter you, agreeable to my","Great Expectations"
"letter.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"O that he had never come! That he had left me at the forge,—far from","Great Expectations"
"contented, yet, by comparison happy!","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And then, dear boy, it was a recompense to me, look’ee here, to know","Great Expectations"
"in secret that I was making a gentleman. The blood horses of them","Great Expectations"
"colonists might fling up the dust over me as I was walking; what do I","Great Expectations"
"say? I says to myself, ‘I’m making a better gentleman nor ever _you_’ll","Great Expectations"
"be!’ When one of ’em says to another, ‘He was a convict, a few year","Great Expectations"
"ago, and is a ignorant common fellow now, for all he’s lucky,’ what do","Great Expectations"
"I say? I says to myself, ‘If I ain’t a gentleman, nor yet ain’t got no","Great Expectations"
"learning, I’m the owner of such. All on you owns stock and land; which","Great Expectations"
"on you owns a brought-up London gentleman?’ This way I kep myself","Great Expectations"
"a-going. And this way I held steady afore my mind that I would for","Great Expectations"
"certain come one day and see my boy, and make myself known to him, on","Great Expectations"
"his own ground.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He laid his hand on my shoulder. I shuddered at the thought that for","Great Expectations"
"anything I knew, his hand might be stained with blood.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It warn’t easy, Pip, for me to leave them parts, nor yet it warn’t","Great Expectations"
"safe. But I held to it, and the harder it was, the stronger I held, for","Great Expectations"
"I was determined, and my mind firm made up. At last I done it. Dear","Great Expectations"
"boy, I done it!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I tried to collect my thoughts, but I was stunned. Throughout, I had","Great Expectations"
"seemed to myself to attend more to the wind and the rain than to him;","Great Expectations"
"even now, I could not separate his voice from those voices, though","Great Expectations"
"those were loud and his was silent.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Where will you put me?” he asked, presently. “I must be put","Great Expectations"
"somewheres, dear boy.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“To sleep?” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes. And to sleep long and sound,” he answered; “for I’ve been","Great Expectations"
"sea-tossed and sea-washed, months and months.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“My friend and companion,” said I, rising from the sofa, “is absent;","Great Expectations"
"you must have his room.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“He won’t come back to-morrow; will he?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No,” said I, answering almost mechanically, in spite of my utmost","Great Expectations"
"efforts; “not to-morrow.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Because, look’ee here, dear boy,” he said, dropping his voice, and","Great Expectations"
"laying a long finger on my breast in an impressive manner, “caution is","Great Expectations"
"necessary.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“How do you mean? Caution?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“By G——, it’s Death!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What’s death?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I was sent for life. It’s death to come back. There’s been overmuch","Great Expectations"
"coming back of late years, and I should of a certainty be hanged if","Great Expectations"
"took.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Nothing was needed but this; the wretched man, after loading wretched","Great Expectations"
"me with his gold and silver chains for years, had risked his life to","Great Expectations"
"come to me, and I held it there in my keeping! If I had loved him","Great Expectations"
"instead of abhorring him; if I had been attracted to him by the","Great Expectations"
"strongest admiration and affection, instead of shrinking from him with","Great Expectations"
"the strongest repugnance; it could have been no worse. On the contrary,","Great Expectations"
"it would have been better, for his preservation would then have","Great Expectations"
"naturally and tenderly addressed my heart.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"My first care was to close the shutters, so that no light might be seen","Great Expectations"
"from without, and then to close and make fast the doors. While I did","Great Expectations"
"so, he stood at the table drinking rum and eating biscuit; and when I","Great Expectations"
"saw him thus engaged, I saw my convict on the marshes at his meal","Great Expectations"
"again. It almost seemed to me as if he must stoop down presently, to","Great Expectations"
"file at his leg.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"When I had gone into Herbert’s room, and had shut off any other","Great Expectations"
"communication between it and the staircase than through the room in","Great Expectations"
"which our conversation had been held, I asked him if he would go to","Great Expectations"
"bed? He said yes, but asked me for some of my “gentleman’s linen” to","Great Expectations"
"put on in the morning. I brought it out, and laid it ready for him, and","Great Expectations"
"my blood again ran cold when he again took me by both hands to give me","Great Expectations"
"good-night.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I got away from him, without knowing how I did it, and mended the fire","Great Expectations"
"in the room where we had been together, and sat down by it, afraid to","Great Expectations"
"go to bed. For an hour or more, I remained too stunned to think; and it","Great Expectations"
"was not until I began to think, that I began fully to know how wrecked","Great Expectations"
"I was, and how the ship in which I had sailed was gone to pieces.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Miss Havisham’s intentions towards me, all a mere dream; Estella not","Great Expectations"
"designed for me; I only suffered in Satis House as a convenience, a","Great Expectations"
"sting for the greedy relations, a model with a mechanical heart to","Great Expectations"
"practise on when no other practice was at hand; those were the first","Great Expectations"
"smarts I had. But, sharpest and deepest pain of all,—it was for the","Great Expectations"
"convict, guilty of I knew not what crimes, and liable to be taken out","Great Expectations"
"of those rooms where I sat thinking, and hanged at the Old Bailey door,","Great Expectations"
"that I had deserted Joe.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I would not have gone back to Joe now, I would not have gone back to","Great Expectations"
"Biddy now, for any consideration; simply, I suppose, because my sense","Great Expectations"
"of my own worthless conduct to them was greater than every","Great Expectations"
"consideration. No wisdom on earth could have given me the comfort that","Great Expectations"
"I should have derived from their simplicity and fidelity; but I could","Great Expectations"
"never, never, undo what I had done.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"In every rage of wind and rush of rain, I heard pursuers. Twice, I","Great Expectations"
"could have sworn there was a knocking and whispering at the outer door.","Great Expectations"
"With these fears upon me, I began either to imagine or recall that I","Great Expectations"
"had had mysterious warnings of this man’s approach. That, for weeks","Great Expectations"
"gone by, I had passed faces in the streets which I had thought like","Great Expectations"
"his. That these likenesses had grown more numerous, as he, coming over","Great Expectations"
"the sea, had drawn nearer. That his wicked spirit had somehow sent","Great Expectations"
"these messengers to mine, and that now on this stormy night he was as","Great Expectations"
"good as his word, and with me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Crowding up with these reflections came the reflection that I had seen","Great Expectations"
"him with my childish eyes to be a desperately violent man; that I had","Great Expectations"
"heard that other convict reiterate that he had tried to murder him;","Great Expectations"
"that I had seen him down in the ditch tearing and fighting like a wild","Great Expectations"
"beast. Out of such remembrances I brought into the light of the fire a","Great Expectations"
"half-formed terror that it might not be safe to be shut up there with","Great Expectations"
"him in the dead of the wild solitary night. This dilated until it","Great Expectations"
"filled the room, and impelled me to take a candle and go in and look at","Great Expectations"
"my dreadful burden.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He had rolled a handkerchief round his head, and his face was set and","Great Expectations"
"lowering in his sleep. But he was asleep, and quietly too, though he","Great Expectations"
"had a pistol lying on the pillow. Assured of this, I softly removed the","Great Expectations"
"key to the outside of his door, and turned it on him before I again sat","Great Expectations"
"down by the fire. Gradually I slipped from the chair and lay on the","Great Expectations"
"floor. When I awoke without having parted in my sleep with the","Great Expectations"
"perception of my wretchedness, the clocks of the Eastward churches were","Great Expectations"
"striking five, the candles were wasted out, the fire was dead, and the","Great Expectations"
"wind and rain intensified the thick black darkness.","Great Expectations"

"It was fortunate for me that I had to take precautions to ensure (so","Great Expectations"

"self-evident. It could not be done, and the attempt to do it would","Great Expectations"
"inevitably engender suspicion. True, I had no Avenger in my service","Great Expectations"
"now, but I was looked after by an inflammatory old female, assisted by","Great Expectations"
"an animated rag-bag whom she called her niece, and to keep a room","Great Expectations"
"secret from them would be to invite curiosity and exaggeration. They","Great Expectations"
"both had weak eyes, which I had long attributed to their chronically","Great Expectations"
"looking in at keyholes, and they were always at hand when not wanted;","Great Expectations"
"indeed that was their only reliable quality besides larceny. Not to get","Great Expectations"
"up a mystery with these people, I resolved to announce in the morning","Great Expectations"
"that my uncle had unexpectedly come from the country.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"This course I decided on while I was yet groping about in the darkness","Great Expectations"
"for the means of getting a light. Not stumbling on the means after all,","Great Expectations"
"I was fain to go out to the adjacent Lodge and get the watchman there","Great Expectations"
"to come with his lantern. Now, in groping my way down the black","Great Expectations"
"staircase I fell over something, and that something was a man crouching","Great Expectations"
"in a corner.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As the man made no answer when I asked him what he did there, but","Great Expectations"
"eluded my touch in silence, I ran to the Lodge and urged the watchman","Great Expectations"
"to come quickly; telling him of the incident on the way back. The wind","Great Expectations"
"being as fierce as ever, we did not care to endanger the light in the","Great Expectations"
"lantern by rekindling the extinguished lamps on the staircase, but we","Great Expectations"
"examined the staircase from the bottom to the top and found no one","Great Expectations"
"there. It then occurred to me as possible that the man might have","Great Expectations"
"slipped into my rooms; so, lighting my candle at the watchman’s, and","Great Expectations"
"leaving him standing at the door, I examined them carefully, including","Great Expectations"
"the room in which my dreaded guest lay asleep. All was quiet, and","Great Expectations"
"assuredly no other man was in those chambers.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It troubled me that there should have been a lurker on the stairs, on","Great Expectations"
"that night of all nights in the year, and I asked the watchman, on the","Great Expectations"
"chance of eliciting some hopeful explanation as I handed him a dram at","Great Expectations"
"the door, whether he had admitted at his gate any gentleman who had","Great Expectations"
"perceptibly been dining out? Yes, he said; at different times of the","Great Expectations"
"night, three. One lived in Fountain Court, and the other two lived in","Great Expectations"
"the Lane, and he had seen them all go home. Again, the only other man","Great Expectations"
"who dwelt in the house of which my chambers formed a part had been in","Great Expectations"
"the country for some weeks, and he certainly had not returned in the","Great Expectations"
"night, because we had seen his door with his seal on it as we came","Great Expectations"
"upstairs.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“The night being so bad, sir,” said the watchman, as he gave me back my","Great Expectations"
"glass, “uncommon few have come in at my gate. Besides them three","Great Expectations"
"gentlemen that I have named, I don’t call to mind another since about","Great Expectations"
"eleven o’clock, when a stranger asked for you.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“My uncle,” I muttered. “Yes.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You saw him, sir?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes. Oh yes.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Likewise the person with him?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Person with him!” I repeated.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I judged the person to be with him,” returned the watchman. “The","Great Expectations"
"person stopped, when he stopped to make inquiry of me, and the person","Great Expectations"
"took this way when he took this way.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What sort of person?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The watchman had not particularly noticed; he should say a working","Great Expectations"
"person; to the best of his belief, he had a dust-coloured kind of","Great Expectations"
"clothes on, under a dark coat. The watchman made more light of the","Great Expectations"
"matter than I did, and naturally; not having my reason for attaching","Great Expectations"
"weight to it.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"When I had got rid of him, which I thought it well to do without","Great Expectations"
"prolonging explanations, my mind was much troubled by these two","Great Expectations"
"circumstances taken together. Whereas they were easy of innocent","Great Expectations"
"solution apart,—as, for instance, some diner out or diner at home, who","Great Expectations"
"had not gone near this watchman’s gate, might have strayed to my","Great Expectations"
"staircase and dropped asleep there,—and my nameless visitor might have","Great Expectations"
"brought some one with him to show him the way,—still, joined, they had","Great Expectations"
"an ugly look to one as prone to distrust and fear as the changes of a","Great Expectations"
"few hours had made me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I lighted my fire, which burnt with a raw pale flare at that time of","Great Expectations"
"the morning, and fell into a doze before it. I seemed to have been","Great Expectations"
"dozing a whole night when the clocks struck six. As there was full an","Great Expectations"
"hour and a half between me and daylight, I dozed again; now, waking up","Great Expectations"
"uneasily, with prolix conversations about nothing, in my ears; now,","Great Expectations"
"making thunder of the wind in the chimney; at length, falling off into","Great Expectations"
"a profound sleep from which the daylight woke me with a start.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"All this time I had never been able to consider my own situation, nor","Great Expectations"
"could I do so yet. I had not the power to attend to it. I was greatly","Great Expectations"
"dejected and distressed, but in an incoherent wholesale sort of way. As","Great Expectations"
"to forming any plan for the future, I could as soon have formed an","Great Expectations"
"elephant. When I opened the shutters and looked out at the wet wild","Great Expectations"
"morning, all of a leaden hue; when I walked from room to room; when I","Great Expectations"
"sat down again shivering, before the fire, waiting for my laundress to","Great Expectations"
"appear; I thought how miserable I was, but hardly knew why, or how long","Great Expectations"
"I had been so, or on what day of the week I made the reflection, or","Great Expectations"
"even who I was that made it.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"At last, the old woman and the niece came in,—the latter with a head","Great Expectations"
"not easily distinguishable from her dusty broom,—and testified surprise","Great Expectations"
"at sight of me and the fire. To whom I imparted how my uncle had come","Great Expectations"
"in the night and was then asleep, and how the breakfast preparations","Great Expectations"
"were to be modified accordingly. Then I washed and dressed while they","Great Expectations"
"knocked the furniture about and made a dust; and so, in a sort of dream","Great Expectations"
"or sleep-waking, I found myself sitting by the fire again, waiting","Great Expectations"
"for—Him—to come to breakfast.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"By and by, his door opened and he came out. I could not bring myself to","Great Expectations"
"bear the sight of him, and I thought he had a worse look by daylight.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I do not even know,” said I, speaking low as he took his seat at the","Great Expectations"
"table, “by what name to call you. I have given out that you are my","Great Expectations"
"uncle.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“That’s it, dear boy! Call me uncle.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You assumed some name, I suppose, on board ship?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, dear boy. I took the name of Provis.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Do you mean to keep that name?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Why, yes, dear boy, it’s as good as another,—unless you’d like","Great Expectations"
"another.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What is your real name?” I asked him in a whisper.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Magwitch,” he answered, in the same tone; “chrisen’d Abel.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What were you brought up to be?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“A warmint, dear boy.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He answered quite seriously, and used the word as if it denoted some","Great Expectations"
"profession.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“When you came into the Temple last night—” said I, pausing to wonder","Great Expectations"
"whether that could really have been last night, which seemed so long","Great Expectations"
"ago.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, dear boy?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“When you came in at the gate and asked the watchman the way here, had","Great Expectations"
"you any one with you?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“With me? No, dear boy.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“But there was some one there?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I didn’t take particular notice,” he said, dubiously, “not knowing the","Great Expectations"
"ways of the place. But I think there _was_ a person, too, come in","Great Expectations"
"alonger me.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Are you known in London?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I hope not!” said he, giving his neck a jerk with his forefinger that","Great Expectations"
"made me turn hot and sick.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Were you known in London, once?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Not over and above, dear boy. I was in the provinces mostly.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Were you—tried—in London?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Which time?” said he, with a sharp look.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“The last time.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He nodded. “First knowed Mr. Jaggers that way. Jaggers was for me.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was on my lips to ask him what he was tried for, but he took up a","Great Expectations"
"knife, gave it a flourish, and with the words, “And what I done is","Great Expectations"
"worked out and paid for!” fell to at his breakfast.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He ate in a ravenous way that was very disagreeable, and all his","Great Expectations"
"actions were uncouth, noisy, and greedy. Some of his teeth had failed","Great Expectations"
"him since I saw him eat on the marshes, and as he turned his food in","Great Expectations"
"his mouth, and turned his head sideways to bring his strongest fangs to","Great Expectations"
"bear upon it, he looked terribly like a hungry old dog. If I had begun","Great Expectations"
"with any appetite, he would have taken it away, and I should have sat","Great Expectations"
"much as I did,—repelled from him by an insurmountable aversion, and","Great Expectations"
"gloomily looking at the cloth.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I’m a heavy grubber, dear boy,” he said, as a polite kind of apology","Great Expectations"
"when he made an end of his meal, “but I always was. If it had been in","Great Expectations"
"my constitution to be a lighter grubber, I might ha’ got into lighter","Great Expectations"
"trouble. Similarly, I must have my smoke. When I was first hired out as","Great Expectations"
"shepherd t’other side the world, it’s my belief I should ha’ turned","Great Expectations"
"into a molloncolly-mad sheep myself, if I hadn’t a had my smoke.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As he said so, he got up from table, and putting his hand into the","Great Expectations"
"breast of the pea-coat he wore, brought out a short black pipe, and a","Great Expectations"
"handful of loose tobacco of the kind that is called Negro-head. Having","Great Expectations"
"filled his pipe, he put the surplus tobacco back again, as if his","Great Expectations"
"pocket were a drawer. Then, he took a live coal from the fire with the","Great Expectations"
"tongs, and lighted his pipe at it, and then turned round on the","Great Expectations"
"hearth-rug with his back to the fire, and went through his favourite","Great Expectations"
"action of holding out both his hands for mine.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And this,” said he, dandling my hands up and down in his, as he puffed","Great Expectations"
"at his pipe,—“and this is the gentleman what I made! The real genuine","Great Expectations"
"One! It does me good fur to look at you, Pip. All I stip’late, is, to","Great Expectations"
"stand by and look at you, dear boy!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I released my hands as soon as I could, and found that I was beginning","Great Expectations"
"slowly to settle down to the contemplation of my condition. What I was","Great Expectations"
"chained to, and how heavily, became intelligible to me, as I heard his","Great Expectations"
"hoarse voice, and sat looking up at his furrowed bald head with its","Great Expectations"
"iron grey hair at the sides.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I mustn’t see my gentleman a footing it in the mire of the streets;","Great Expectations"
"there mustn’t be no mud on _his_ boots. My gentleman must have horses,","Great Expectations"
"Pip! Horses to ride, and horses to drive, and horses for his servant to","Great Expectations"
"ride and drive as well. Shall colonists have their horses (and blood","Great Expectations"
"’uns, if you please, good Lord!) and not my London gentleman? No, no.","Great Expectations"
"We’ll show ’em another pair of shoes than that, Pip; won’t us?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He took out of his pocket a great thick pocket-book, bursting with","Great Expectations"
"papers, and tossed it on the table.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“There’s something worth spending in that there book, dear boy. It’s","Great Expectations"
"yourn. All I’ve got ain’t mine; it’s yourn. Don’t you be afeerd on it.","Great Expectations"
"There’s more where that come from. I’ve come to the old country fur to","Great Expectations"
"see my gentleman spend his money _like_ a gentleman. That’ll be _my_","Great Expectations"
"pleasure. _My_ pleasure ’ull be fur to see him do it. And blast you","Great Expectations"
"all!” he wound up, looking round the room and snapping his fingers once","Great Expectations"
"with a loud snap, “blast you every one, from the judge in his wig, to","Great Expectations"
"the colonist a stirring up the dust, I’ll show a better gentleman than","Great Expectations"
"the whole kit on you put together!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Stop!” said I, almost in a frenzy of fear and dislike, “I want to","Great Expectations"
"speak to you. I want to know what is to be done. I want to know how you","Great Expectations"
"are to be kept out of danger, how long you are going to stay, what","Great Expectations"
"projects you have.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Look’ee here, Pip,” said he, laying his hand on my arm in a suddenly","Great Expectations"
"altered and subdued manner; “first of all, look’ee here. I forgot","Great Expectations"
"myself half a minute ago. What I said was low; that’s what it was; low.","Great Expectations"
"Look’ee here, Pip. Look over it. I ain’t a-going to be low.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“First,” I resumed, half groaning, “what precautions can be taken","Great Expectations"
"against your being recognised and seized?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No, dear boy,” he said, in the same tone as before, “that don’t go","Great Expectations"
"first. Lowness goes first. I ain’t took so many year to make a","Great Expectations"
"gentleman, not without knowing what’s due to him. Look’ee here, Pip. I","Great Expectations"
"was low; that’s what I was; low. Look over it, dear boy.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Some sense of the grimly-ludicrous moved me to a fretful laugh, as I","Great Expectations"
"replied, “I _have_ looked over it. In Heaven’s name, don’t harp upon","Great Expectations"
"it!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, but look’ee here,” he persisted. “Dear boy, I ain’t come so fur,","Great Expectations"
"not fur to be low. Now, go on, dear boy. You was a saying—”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“How are you to be guarded from the danger you have incurred?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well, dear boy, the danger ain’t so great. Without I was informed","Great Expectations"
"agen, the danger ain’t so much to signify. There’s Jaggers, and there’s","Great Expectations"
"Wemmick, and there’s you. Who else is there to inform?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Is there no chance person who might identify you in the street?” said","Great Expectations"
"I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well,” he returned, “there ain’t many. Nor yet I don’t intend to","Great Expectations"
"advertise myself in the newspapers by the name of A.M. come back from","Great Expectations"
"Botany Bay; and years have rolled away, and who’s to gain by it? Still,","Great Expectations"
"look’ee here, Pip. If the danger had been fifty times as great, I","Great Expectations"
"should ha’ come to see you, mind you, just the same.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And how long do you remain?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“How long?” said he, taking his black pipe from his mouth, and dropping","Great Expectations"
"his jaw as he stared at me. “I’m not a-going back. I’ve come for good.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Where are you to live?” said I. “What is to be done with you? Where","Great Expectations"
"will you be safe?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Dear boy,” he returned, “there’s disguising wigs can be bought for","Great Expectations"
"money, and there’s hair powder, and spectacles, and black","Great Expectations"
"clothes,—shorts and what not. Others has done it safe afore, and what","Great Expectations"
"others has done afore, others can do agen. As to the where and how of","Great Expectations"
"living, dear boy, give me your own opinions on it.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You take it smoothly now,” said I, “but you were very serious last","Great Expectations"
"night, when you swore it was Death.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And so I swear it is Death,” said he, putting his pipe back in his","Great Expectations"
"mouth, “and Death by the rope, in the open street not fur from this,","Great Expectations"
"and it’s serious that you should fully understand it to be so. What","Great Expectations"
"then, when that’s once done? Here I am. To go back now ’ud be as bad as","Great Expectations"
"to stand ground—worse. Besides, Pip, I’m here, because I’ve meant it by","Great Expectations"
"you, years and years. As to what I dare, I’m a old bird now, as has","Great Expectations"
"dared all manner of traps since first he was fledged, and I’m not","Great Expectations"
"afeerd to perch upon a scarecrow. If there’s Death hid inside of it,","Great Expectations"
"there is, and let him come out, and I’ll face him, and then I’ll","Great Expectations"
"believe in him and not afore. And now let me have a look at my","Great Expectations"
"gentleman agen.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Once more, he took me by both hands and surveyed me with an air of","Great Expectations"
"admiring proprietorship: smoking with great complacency all the while.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It appeared to me that I could do no better than secure him some quiet","Great Expectations"
"lodging hard by, of which he might take possession when Herbert","Great Expectations"
"returned: whom I expected in two or three days. That the secret must be","Great Expectations"
"confided to Herbert as a matter of unavoidable necessity, even if I","Great Expectations"
"could have put the immense relief I should derive from sharing it with","Great Expectations"
"him out of the question, was plain to me. But it was by no means so","Great Expectations"
"plain to Mr. Provis (I resolved to call him by that name), who reserved","Great Expectations"
"his consent to Herbert’s participation until he should have seen him","Great Expectations"
"and formed a favourable judgment of his physiognomy. “And even then,","Great Expectations"
"dear boy,” said he, pulling a greasy little clasped black Testament out","Great Expectations"
"of his pocket, “we’ll have him on his oath.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"To state that my terrible patron carried this little black book about","Great Expectations"
"the world solely to swear people on in cases of emergency, would be to","Great Expectations"
"state what I never quite established; but this I can say, that I never","Great Expectations"
"knew him put it to any other use. The book itself had the appearance of","Great Expectations"
"having been stolen from some court of justice, and perhaps his","Great Expectations"
"knowledge of its antecedents, combined with his own experience in that","Great Expectations"
"wise, gave him a reliance on its powers as a sort of legal spell or","Great Expectations"
"charm. On this first occasion of his producing it, I recalled how he","Great Expectations"
"had made me swear fidelity in the churchyard long ago, and how he had","Great Expectations"
"described himself last night as always swearing to his resolutions in","Great Expectations"
"his solitude.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As he was at present dressed in a seafaring slop suit, in which he","Great Expectations"
"looked as if he had some parrots and cigars to dispose of, I next","Great Expectations"
"discussed with him what dress he should wear. He cherished an","Great Expectations"
"extraordinary belief in the virtues of “shorts” as a disguise, and had","Great Expectations"
"in his own mind sketched a dress for himself that would have made him","Great Expectations"
"something between a dean and a dentist. It was with considerable","Great Expectations"
"difficulty that I won him over to the assumption of a dress more like a","Great Expectations"
"prosperous farmer’s; and we arranged that he should cut his hair close,","Great Expectations"
"and wear a little powder. Lastly, as he had not yet been seen by the","Great Expectations"
"laundress or her niece, he was to keep himself out of their view until","Great Expectations"
"his change of dress was made.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It would seem a simple matter to decide on these precautions; but in my","Great Expectations"
"dazed, not to say distracted, state, it took so long, that I did not","Great Expectations"
"get out to further them until two or three in the afternoon. He was to","Great Expectations"
"remain shut up in the chambers while I was gone, and was on no account","Great Expectations"
"to open the door.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"There being to my knowledge a respectable lodging-house in Essex","Great Expectations"
"Street, the back of which looked into the Temple, and was almost within","Great Expectations"
"hail of my windows, I first of all repaired to that house, and was so","Great Expectations"
"fortunate as to secure the second floor for my uncle, Mr. Provis. I","Great Expectations"
"then went from shop to shop, making such purchases as were necessary to","Great Expectations"
"the change in his appearance. This business transacted, I turned my","Great Expectations"
"face, on my own account, to Little Britain. Mr. Jaggers was at his","Great Expectations"
"desk, but, seeing me enter, got up immediately and stood before his","Great Expectations"
"fire.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Now, Pip,” said he, “be careful.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I will, sir,” I returned. For, coming along I had thought well of what","Great Expectations"
"I was going to say.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Don’t commit yourself,” said Mr. Jaggers, “and don’t commit any one.","Great Expectations"
"You understand—any one. Don’t tell me anything: I don’t want to know","Great Expectations"
"anything; I am not curious.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Of course I saw that he knew the man was come.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I merely want, Mr. Jaggers,” said I, “to assure myself that what I","Great Expectations"
"have been told is true. I have no hope of its being untrue, but at","Great Expectations"
"least I may verify it.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Jaggers nodded. “But did you say ‘told’ or ‘informed’?” he asked","Great Expectations"
"me, with his head on one side, and not looking at me, but looking in a","Great Expectations"
"listening way at the floor. “Told would seem to imply verbal","Great Expectations"
"communication. You can’t have verbal communication with a man in New","Great Expectations"
"South Wales, you know.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I will say, informed, Mr. Jaggers.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Good.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I have been informed by a person named Abel Magwitch, that he is the","Great Expectations"
"benefactor so long unknown to me.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“That is the man,” said Mr. Jaggers, “in New South Wales.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And only he?” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And only he,” said Mr. Jaggers.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I am not so unreasonable, sir, as to think you at all responsible for","Great Expectations"
"my mistakes and wrong conclusions; but I always supposed it was Miss","Great Expectations"
"Havisham.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“As you say, Pip,” returned Mr. Jaggers, turning his eyes upon me","Great Expectations"
"coolly, and taking a bite at his forefinger, “I am not at all","Great Expectations"
"responsible for that.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And yet it looked so like it, sir,” I pleaded with a downcast heart.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Not a particle of evidence, Pip,” said Mr. Jaggers, shaking his head","Great Expectations"
"and gathering up his skirts. “Take nothing on its looks; take","Great Expectations"
"everything on evidence. There’s no better rule.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I have no more to say,” said I, with a sigh, after standing silent for","Great Expectations"
"a little while. “I have verified my information, and there’s an end.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And Magwitch—in New South Wales—having at last disclosed himself,”","Great Expectations"
"said Mr. Jaggers, “you will comprehend, Pip, how rigidly throughout my","Great Expectations"
"communication with you, I have always adhered to the strict line of","Great Expectations"
"fact. There has never been the least departure from the strict line of","Great Expectations"
"fact. You are quite aware of that?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Quite, sir.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I communicated to Magwitch—in New South Wales—when he first wrote to","Great Expectations"
"me—from New South Wales—the caution that he must not expect me ever to","Great Expectations"
"deviate from the strict line of fact. I also communicated to him","Great Expectations"
"another caution. He appeared to me to have obscurely hinted in his","Great Expectations"
"letter at some distant idea he had of seeing you in England here. I","Great Expectations"
"cautioned him that I must hear no more of that; that he was not at all","Great Expectations"
"likely to obtain a pardon; that he was expatriated for the term of his","Great Expectations"
"natural life; and that his presenting himself in this country would be","Great Expectations"
"an act of felony, rendering him liable to the extreme penalty of the","Great Expectations"
"law. I gave Magwitch that caution,” said Mr. Jaggers, looking hard at","Great Expectations"
"me; “I wrote it to New South Wales. He guided himself by it, no doubt.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No doubt,” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I have been informed by Wemmick,” pursued Mr. Jaggers, still looking","Great Expectations"
"hard at me, “that he has received a letter, under date Portsmouth, from","Great Expectations"
"a colonist of the name of Purvis, or—”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Or Provis,” I suggested.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Or Provis—thank you, Pip. Perhaps it _is_ Provis? Perhaps you know","Great Expectations"
"it’s Provis?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes,” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You know it’s Provis. A letter, under date Portsmouth, from a colonist","Great Expectations"
"of the name of Provis, asking for the particulars of your address, on","Great Expectations"
"behalf of Magwitch. Wemmick sent him the particulars, I understand, by","Great Expectations"
"return of post. Probably it is through Provis that you have received","Great Expectations"
"the explanation of Magwitch—in New South Wales?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It came through Provis,” I replied.","Great Expectations"

"“Good day, Pip,” said Mr. Jaggers, offering his hand; “glad to have","Great Expectations"
"seen you. In writing by post to Magwitch—in New South Wales—or in","Great Expectations"
"communicating with him through Provis, have the goodness to mention","Great Expectations"
"that the particulars and vouchers of our long account shall be sent to","Great Expectations"
"you, together with the balance; for there is still a balance remaining.","Great Expectations"
"Good-day, Pip!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We shook hands, and he looked hard at me as long as he could see me. I","Great Expectations"
"turned at the door, and he was still looking hard at me, while the two","Great Expectations"
"vile casts on the shelf seemed to be trying to get their eyelids open,","Great Expectations"
"and to force out of their swollen throats, “O, what a man he is!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Wemmick was out, and though he had been at his desk he could have done","Great Expectations"
"nothing for me. I went straight back to the Temple, where I found the","Great Expectations"
"terrible Provis drinking rum and water and smoking negro-head, in","Great Expectations"
"safety.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Next day the clothes I had ordered all came home, and he put them on.","Great Expectations"
"Whatever he put on, became him less (it dismally seemed to me) than","Great Expectations"
"what he had worn before. To my thinking, there was something in him","Great Expectations"
"that made it hopeless to attempt to disguise him. The more I dressed","Great Expectations"
"him and the better I dressed him, the more he looked like the slouching","Great Expectations"
"fugitive on the marshes. This effect on my anxious fancy was partly","Great Expectations"
"referable, no doubt, to his old face and manner growing more familiar","Great Expectations"
"to me; but I believe too that he dragged one of his legs as if there","Great Expectations"
"were still a weight of iron on it, and that from head to foot there was","Great Expectations"
"Convict in the very grain of the man.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The influences of his solitary hut-life were upon him besides, and gave","Great Expectations"
"him a savage air that no dress could tame; added to these were the","Great Expectations"
"influences of his subsequent branded life among men, and, crowning all,","Great Expectations"
"his consciousness that he was dodging and hiding now. In all his ways","Great Expectations"
"of sitting and standing, and eating and drinking,—of brooding about in","Great Expectations"
"a high-shouldered reluctant style,—of taking out his great horn-handled","Great Expectations"
"jackknife and wiping it on his legs and cutting his food,—of lifting","Great Expectations"
"light glasses and cups to his lips, as if they were clumsy","Great Expectations"
"pannikins,—of chopping a wedge off his bread, and soaking up with it","Great Expectations"
"the last fragments of gravy round and round his plate, as if to make","Great Expectations"
"the most of an allowance, and then drying his finger-ends on it, and","Great Expectations"
"then swallowing it,—in these ways and a thousand other small nameless","Great Expectations"
"instances arising every minute in the day, there was Prisoner, Felon,","Great Expectations"
"Bondsman, plain as plain could be.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It had been his own idea to wear that touch of powder, and I had","Great Expectations"
"conceded the powder after overcoming the shorts. But I can compare the","Great Expectations"
"effect of it, when on, to nothing but the probable effect of rouge upon","Great Expectations"
"the dead; so awful was the manner in which everything in him that it","Great Expectations"
"was most desirable to repress, started through that thin layer of","Great Expectations"
"pretence, and seemed to come blazing out at the crown of his head. It","Great Expectations"
"was abandoned as soon as tried, and he wore his grizzled hair cut","Great Expectations"
"short.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Words cannot tell what a sense I had, at the same time, of the dreadful","Great Expectations"
"mystery that he was to me. When he fell asleep of an evening, with his","Great Expectations"
"knotted hands clenching the sides of the easy-chair, and his bald head","Great Expectations"
"tattooed with deep wrinkles falling forward on his breast, I would sit","Great Expectations"
"and look at him, wondering what he had done, and loading him with all","Great Expectations"
"the crimes in the Calendar, until the impulse was powerful on me to","Great Expectations"
"start up and fly from him. Every hour so increased my abhorrence of","Great Expectations"
"him, that I even think I might have yielded to this impulse in the","Great Expectations"
"first agonies of being so haunted, notwithstanding all he had done for","Great Expectations"
"me and the risk he ran, but for the knowledge that Herbert must soon","Great Expectations"
"come back. Once, I actually did start out of bed in the night, and","Great Expectations"
"begin to dress myself in my worst clothes, hurriedly intending to leave","Great Expectations"
"him there with everything else I possessed, and enlist for India as a","Great Expectations"
"private soldier.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I doubt if a ghost could have been more terrible to me, up in those","Great Expectations"
"lonely rooms in the long evenings and long nights, with the wind and","Great Expectations"
"the rain always rushing by. A ghost could not have been taken and","Great Expectations"
"hanged on my account, and the consideration that he could be, and the","Great Expectations"
"dread that he would be, were no small addition to my horrors. When he","Great Expectations"
"was not asleep, or playing a complicated kind of Patience with a ragged","Great Expectations"
"pack of cards of his own,—a game that I never saw before or since, and","Great Expectations"
"in which he recorded his winnings by sticking his jackknife into the","Great Expectations"
"table,—when he was not engaged in either of these pursuits, he would","Great Expectations"
"ask me to read to him,—“Foreign language, dear boy!” While I complied,","Great Expectations"
"he, not comprehending a single word, would stand before the fire","Great Expectations"
"surveying me with the air of an Exhibitor, and I would see him, between","Great Expectations"
"the fingers of the hand with which I shaded my face, appealing in dumb","Great Expectations"
"show to the furniture to take notice of my proficiency. The imaginary","Great Expectations"
"student pursued by the misshapen creature he had impiously made, was","Great Expectations"
"not more wretched than I, pursued by the creature who had made me, and","Great Expectations"
"recoiling from him with a stronger repulsion, the more he admired me","Great Expectations"
"and the fonder he was of me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"This is written of, I am sensible, as if it had lasted a year. It","Great Expectations"
"lasted about five days. Expecting Herbert all the time, I dared not go","Great Expectations"
"out, except when I took Provis for an airing after dark. At length, one","Great Expectations"
"evening when dinner was over and I had dropped into a slumber quite","Great Expectations"
"worn out,—for my nights had been agitated and my rest broken by fearful","Great Expectations"
"dreams,—I was roused by the welcome footstep on the staircase. Provis,","Great Expectations"
"who had been asleep too, staggered up at the noise I made, and in an","Great Expectations"
"instant I saw his jackknife shining in his hand.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Quiet! It’s Herbert!” I said; and Herbert came bursting in, with the","Great Expectations"
"airy freshness of six hundred miles of France upon him.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Handel, my dear fellow, how are you, and again how are you, and again","Great Expectations"
"how are you? I seem to have been gone a twelvemonth! Why, so I must","Great Expectations"
"have been, for you have grown quite thin and pale! Handel, my—Halloa! I","Great Expectations"
"beg your pardon.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He was stopped in his running on and in his shaking hands with me, by","Great Expectations"
"seeing Provis. Provis, regarding him with a fixed attention, was slowly","Great Expectations"
"putting up his jackknife, and groping in another pocket for something","Great Expectations"
"else.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Herbert, my dear friend,” said I, shutting the double doors, while","Great Expectations"
"Herbert stood staring and wondering, “something very strange has","Great Expectations"
"happened. This is—a visitor of mine.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It’s all right, dear boy!” said Provis coming forward, with his little","Great Expectations"
"clasped black book, and then addressing himself to Herbert. “Take it in","Great Expectations"
"your right hand. Lord strike you dead on the spot, if ever you split in","Great Expectations"
"any way sumever! Kiss it!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Do so, as he wishes it,” I said to Herbert. So, Herbert, looking at me","Great Expectations"
"with a friendly uneasiness and amazement, complied, and Provis","Great Expectations"
"immediately shaking hands with him, said, “Now you’re on your oath, you","Great Expectations"
"know. And never believe me on mine, if Pip shan’t make a gentleman on","Great Expectations"
"you!”","Great Expectations"

"Chapter XLI.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"In vain should I attempt to describe the astonishment and disquiet of","Great Expectations"
"Herbert, when he and I and Provis sat down before the fire, and I","Great Expectations"
"recounted the whole of the secret. Enough, that I saw my own feelings","Great Expectations"
"reflected in Herbert’s face, and not least among them, my repugnance","Great Expectations"
"towards the man who had done so much for me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"What would alone have set a division between that man and us, if there","Great Expectations"
"had been no other dividing circumstance, was his triumph in my story.","Great Expectations"
"Saving his troublesome sense of having been “low” on one occasion since","Great Expectations"
"his return,—on which point he began to hold forth to Herbert, the","Great Expectations"
"moment my revelation was finished,—he had no perception of the","Great Expectations"
"possibility of my finding any fault with my good fortune. His boast","Great Expectations"
"that he had made me a gentleman, and that he had come to see me support","Great Expectations"
"the character on his ample resources, was made for me quite as much as","Great Expectations"
"for himself. And that it was a highly agreeable boast to both of us,","Great Expectations"
"and that we must both be very proud of it, was a conclusion quite","Great Expectations"
"established in his own mind.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Though, look’ee here, Pip’s comrade,” he said to Herbert, after having","Great Expectations"
"discoursed for some time, “I know very well that once since I come","Great Expectations"
"back—for half a minute—I’ve been low. I said to Pip, I knowed as I had","Great Expectations"
"been low. But don’t you fret yourself on that score. I ain’t made Pip a","Great Expectations"
"gentleman, and Pip ain’t a-going to make you a gentleman, not fur me","Great Expectations"
"not to know what’s due to ye both. Dear boy, and Pip’s comrade, you two","Great Expectations"
"may count upon me always having a genteel muzzle on. Muzzled I have","Great Expectations"
"been since that half a minute when I was betrayed into lowness, muzzled","Great Expectations"
"I am at the present time, muzzled I ever will be.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Herbert said, “Certainly,” but looked as if there were no specific","Great Expectations"
"consolation in this, and remained perplexed and dismayed. We were","Great Expectations"
"anxious for the time when he would go to his lodging and leave us","Great Expectations"
"together, but he was evidently jealous of leaving us together, and sat","Great Expectations"
"late. It was midnight before I took him round to Essex Street, and saw","Great Expectations"
"him safely in at his own dark door. When it closed upon him, I","Great Expectations"
"experienced the first moment of relief I had known since the night of","Great Expectations"
"his arrival.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Never quite free from an uneasy remembrance of the man on the stairs, I","Great Expectations"
"had always looked about me in taking my guest out after dark, and in","Great Expectations"
"bringing him back; and I looked about me now. Difficult as it is in a","Great Expectations"
"large city to avoid the suspicion of being watched, when the mind is","Great Expectations"
"conscious of danger in that regard, I could not persuade myself that","Great Expectations"
"any of the people within sight cared about my movements. The few who","Great Expectations"
"were passing passed on their several ways, and the street was empty","Great Expectations"
"when I turned back into the Temple. Nobody had come out at the gate","Great Expectations"
"with us, nobody went in at the gate with me. As I crossed by the","Great Expectations"
"fountain, I saw his lighted back windows looking bright and quiet, and,","Great Expectations"
"when I stood for a few moments in the doorway of the building where I","Great Expectations"
"lived, before going up the stairs, Garden Court was as still and","Great Expectations"
"lifeless as the staircase was when I ascended it.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Herbert received me with open arms, and I had never felt before so","Great Expectations"
"blessedly what it is to have a friend. When he had spoken some sound","Great Expectations"
"words of sympathy and encouragement, we sat down to consider the","Great Expectations"
"question, What was to be done?","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The chair that Provis had occupied still remaining where it had","Great Expectations"
"stood,—for he had a barrack way with him of hanging about one spot, in","Great Expectations"
"one unsettled manner, and going through one round of observances with","Great Expectations"
"his pipe and his negro-head and his jackknife and his pack of cards,","Great Expectations"
"and what not, as if it were all put down for him on a slate,—I say his","Great Expectations"
"chair remaining where it had stood, Herbert unconsciously took it, but","Great Expectations"
"next moment started out of it, pushed it away, and took another. He had","Great Expectations"
"no occasion to say after that that he had conceived an aversion for my","Great Expectations"
"patron, neither had I occasion to confess my own. We interchanged that","Great Expectations"
"confidence without shaping a syllable.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What,” said I to Herbert, when he was safe in another chair,—“what is","Great Expectations"
"to be done?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“My poor dear Handel,” he replied, holding his head, “I am too stunned","Great Expectations"
"to think.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“So was I, Herbert, when the blow first fell. Still, something must be","Great Expectations"
"done. He is intent upon various new expenses,—horses, and carriages,","Great Expectations"
"and lavish appearances of all kinds. He must be stopped somehow.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You mean that you can’t accept—”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“How can I?” I interposed, as Herbert paused. “Think of him! Look at","Great Expectations"
"him!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"An involuntary shudder passed over both of us.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yet I am afraid the dreadful truth is, Herbert, that he is attached to","Great Expectations"
"me, strongly attached to me. Was there ever such a fate!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“My poor dear Handel,” Herbert repeated.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Then,” said I, “after all, stopping short here, never taking another","Great Expectations"
"penny from him, think what I owe him already! Then again: I am heavily","Great Expectations"
"in debt,—very heavily for me, who have now no expectations,—and I have","Great Expectations"
"been bred to no calling, and I am fit for nothing.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well, well, well!” Herbert remonstrated. “Don’t say fit for nothing.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What am I fit for? I know only one thing that I am fit for, and that","Great Expectations"
"is, to go for a soldier. And I might have gone, my dear Herbert, but","Great Expectations"
"for the prospect of taking counsel with your friendship and affection.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Of course I broke down there: and of course Herbert, beyond seizing a","Great Expectations"
"warm grip of my hand, pretended not to know it.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Anyhow, my dear Handel,” said he presently, “soldiering won’t do. If","Great Expectations"
"you were to renounce this patronage and these favours, I suppose you","Great Expectations"
"would do so with some faint hope of one day repaying what you have","Great Expectations"
"already had. Not very strong, that hope, if you went soldiering!","Great Expectations"
"Besides, it’s absurd. You would be infinitely better in Clarriker’s","Great Expectations"
"house, small as it is. I am working up towards a partnership, you","Great Expectations"
"know.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Poor fellow! He little suspected with whose money.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“But there is another question,” said Herbert. “This is an ignorant,","Great Expectations"
"determined man, who has long had one fixed idea. More than that, he","Great Expectations"
"seems to me (I may misjudge him) to be a man of a desperate and fierce","Great Expectations"
"character.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I know he is,” I returned. “Let me tell you what evidence I have seen","Great Expectations"
"of it.” And I told him what I had not mentioned in my narrative, of","Great Expectations"
"that encounter with the other convict.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“See, then,” said Herbert; “think of this! He comes here at the peril","Great Expectations"
"of his life, for the realisation of his fixed idea. In the moment of","Great Expectations"
"realisation, after all his toil and waiting, you cut the ground from","Great Expectations"
"under his feet, destroy his idea, and make his gains worthless to him.","Great Expectations"
"Do you see nothing that he might do, under the disappointment?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I have seen it, Herbert, and dreamed of it, ever since the fatal night","Great Expectations"
"of his arrival. Nothing has been in my thoughts so distinctly as his","Great Expectations"
"putting himself in the way of being taken.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Then you may rely upon it,” said Herbert, “that there would be great","Great Expectations"
"danger of his doing it. That is his power over you as long as he","Great Expectations"
"remains in England, and that would be his reckless course if you","Great Expectations"
"forsook him.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I was so struck by the horror of this idea, which had weighed upon me","Great Expectations"
"from the first, and the working out of which would make me regard","Great Expectations"
"myself, in some sort, as his murderer, that I could not rest in my","Great Expectations"
"chair, but began pacing to and fro. I said to Herbert, meanwhile, that","Great Expectations"
"even if Provis were recognised and taken, in spite of himself, I should","Great Expectations"
"be wretched as the cause, however innocently. Yes; even though I was so","Great Expectations"
"wretched in having him at large and near me, and even though I would","Great Expectations"
"far rather have worked at the forge all the days of my life than I","Great Expectations"
"would ever have come to this!","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"But there was no staving off the question, What was to be done?","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“The first and the main thing to be done,” said Herbert, “is to get him","Great Expectations"
"out of England. You will have to go with him, and then he may be","Great Expectations"
"induced to go.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“But get him where I will, could I prevent his coming back?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“My good Handel, is it not obvious that with Newgate in the next","Great Expectations"
"street, there must be far greater hazard in your breaking your mind to","Great Expectations"
"him and making him reckless, here, than elsewhere? If a pretext to get","Great Expectations"
"him away could be made out of that other convict, or out of anything","Great Expectations"
"else in his life, now.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“There, again!” said I, stopping before Herbert, with my open hands","Great Expectations"
"held out, as if they contained the desperation of the case. “I know","Great Expectations"
"nothing of his life. It has almost made me mad to sit here of a night","Great Expectations"
"and see him before me, so bound up with my fortunes and misfortunes,","Great Expectations"
"and yet so unknown to me, except as the miserable wretch who terrified","Great Expectations"
"me two days in my childhood!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Herbert got up, and linked his arm in mine, and we slowly walked to and","Great Expectations"
"fro together, studying the carpet.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Handel,” said Herbert, stopping, “you feel convinced that you can take","Great Expectations"
"no further benefits from him; do you?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Fully. Surely you would, too, if you were in my place?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And you feel convinced that you must break with him?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Herbert, can you ask me?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And you have, and are bound to have, that tenderness for the life he","Great Expectations"
"has risked on your account, that you must save him, if possible, from","Great Expectations"
"throwing it away. Then you must get him out of England before you stir","Great Expectations"
"a finger to extricate yourself. That done, extricate yourself, in","Great Expectations"
"Heaven’s name, and we’ll see it out together, dear old boy.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was a comfort to shake hands upon it, and walk up and down again,","Great Expectations"
"with only that done.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Now, Herbert,” said I, “with reference to gaining some knowledge of","Great Expectations"
"his history. There is but one way that I know of. I must ask him point","Great Expectations"
"blank.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes. Ask him,” said Herbert, “when we sit at breakfast in the","Great Expectations"
"morning.” For he had said, on taking leave of Herbert, that he would","Great Expectations"
"come to breakfast with us.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"With this project formed, we went to bed. I had the wildest dreams","Great Expectations"
"concerning him, and woke unrefreshed; I woke, too, to recover the fear","Great Expectations"
"which I had lost in the night, of his being found out as a returned","Great Expectations"
"transport. Waking, I never lost that fear.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He came round at the appointed time, took out his jackknife, and sat","Great Expectations"
"down to his meal. He was full of plans “for his gentleman’s coming out","Great Expectations"
"strong, and like a gentleman,” and urged me to begin speedily upon the","Great Expectations"
"pocket-book which he had left in my possession. He considered the","Great Expectations"
"chambers and his own lodging as temporary residences, and advised me to","Great Expectations"
"look out at once for a “fashionable crib” near Hyde Park, in which he","Great Expectations"
"could have “a shake-down.” When he had made an end of his breakfast,","Great Expectations"
"and was wiping his knife on his leg, I said to him, without a word of","Great Expectations"
"preface,—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“After you were gone last night, I told my friend of the struggle that","Great Expectations"
"the soldiers found you engaged in on the marshes, when we came up. You","Great Expectations"
"remember?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Remember!” said he. “I think so!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“We want to know something about that man—and about you. It is strange","Great Expectations"
"to know no more about either, and particularly you, than I was able to","Great Expectations"
"tell last night. Is not this as good a time as another for our knowing","Great Expectations"
"more?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well!” he said, after consideration. “You’re on your oath, you know,","Great Expectations"
"Pip’s comrade?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Assuredly,” replied Herbert.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“As to anything I say, you know,” he insisted. “The oath applies to","Great Expectations"
"all.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I understand it to do so.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And look’ee here! Wotever I done is worked out and paid for,” he","Great Expectations"
"insisted again.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“So be it.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He took out his black pipe and was going to fill it with negro-head,","Great Expectations"
"when, looking at the tangle of tobacco in his hand, he seemed to think","Great Expectations"
"it might perplex the thread of his narrative. He put it back again,","Great Expectations"
"stuck his pipe in a button-hole of his coat, spread a hand on each","Great Expectations"
"knee, and after turning an angry eye on the fire for a few silent","Great Expectations"
"moments, looked round at us and said what follows.","Great Expectations"

"Chapter XLII.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Dear boy and Pip’s comrade. I am not a-going fur to tell you my life","Great Expectations"
"like a song, or a story-book. But to give it you short and handy, I’ll","Great Expectations"
"put it at once into a mouthful of English. In jail and out of jail, in","Great Expectations"
"jail and out of jail, in jail and out of jail. There, you’ve got it.","Great Expectations"
"That’s _my_ life pretty much, down to such times as I got shipped off,","Great Expectations"
"arter Pip stood my friend.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I’ve been done everything to, pretty well—except hanged. I’ve been","Great Expectations"
"locked up as much as a silver tea-kittle. I’ve been carted here and","Great Expectations"
"carted there, and put out of this town, and put out of that town, and","Great Expectations"
"stuck in the stocks, and whipped and worried and drove. I’ve no more","Great Expectations"
"notion where I was born than you have—if so much. I first become aware","Great Expectations"
"of myself down in Essex, a thieving turnips for my living. Summun had","Great Expectations"
"run away from me—a man—a tinker—and he’d took the fire with him, and","Great Expectations"
"left me wery cold.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I know’d my name to be Magwitch, chrisen’d Abel. How did I know it?","Great Expectations"
"Much as I know’d the birds’ names in the hedges to be chaffinch,","Great Expectations"
"sparrer, thrush. I might have thought it was all lies together, only as","Great Expectations"
"the birds’ names come out true, I supposed mine did.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“So fur as I could find, there warn’t a soul that see young Abel","Great Expectations"
"Magwitch, with us little on him as in him, but wot caught fright at","Great Expectations"
"him, and either drove him off, or took him up. I was took up, took up,","Great Expectations"
"took up, to that extent that I reg’larly grow’d up took up.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“This is the way it was, that when I was a ragged little creetur as","Great Expectations"
"much to be pitied as ever I see (not that I looked in the glass, for","Great Expectations"
"there warn’t many insides of furnished houses known to me), I got the","Great Expectations"
"name of being hardened. ‘This is a terrible hardened one,’ they says to","Great Expectations"
"prison wisitors, picking out me. ‘May be said to live in jails, this","Great Expectations"
"boy.’ Then they looked at me, and I looked at them, and they measured","Great Expectations"
"my head, some on ’em,—they had better a measured my stomach,—and others","Great Expectations"
"on ’em giv me tracts what I couldn’t read, and made me speeches what I","Great Expectations"
"couldn’t understand. They always went on agen me about the Devil. But","Great Expectations"
"what the Devil was I to do? I must put something into my stomach,","Great Expectations"
"mustn’t I?—Howsomever, I’m a getting low, and I know what’s due. Dear","Great Expectations"
"boy and Pip’s comrade, don’t you be afeerd of me being low.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Tramping, begging, thieving, working sometimes when I could,—though","Great Expectations"
"that warn’t as often as you may think, till you put the question","Great Expectations"
"whether you would ha’ been over-ready to give me work yourselves,—a bit","Great Expectations"
"of a poacher, a bit of a labourer, a bit of a wagoner, a bit of a","Great Expectations"
"haymaker, a bit of a hawker, a bit of most things that don’t pay and","Great Expectations"
"lead to trouble, I got to be a man. A deserting soldier in a","Great Expectations"
"Traveller’s Rest, what lay hid up to the chin under a lot of taturs,","Great Expectations"
"learnt me to read; and a travelling Giant what signed his name at a","Great Expectations"
"penny a time learnt me to write. I warn’t locked up as often now as","Great Expectations"
"formerly, but I wore out my good share of key-metal still.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“At Epsom races, a matter of over twenty years ago, I got acquainted","Great Expectations"
"wi’ a man whose skull I’d crack wi’ this poker, like the claw of a","Great Expectations"
"lobster, if I’d got it on this hob. His right name was Compeyson; and","Great Expectations"
"that’s the man, dear boy, what you see me a pounding in the ditch,","Great Expectations"
"according to what you truly told your comrade arter I was gone last","Great Expectations"
"night.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“He set up fur a gentleman, this Compeyson, and he’d been to a public","Great Expectations"
"boarding-school and had learning. He was a smooth one to talk, and was","Great Expectations"
"a dab at the ways of gentlefolks. He was good-looking too. It was the","Great Expectations"
"night afore the great race, when I found him on the heath, in a booth","Great Expectations"
"that I know’d on. Him and some more was a sitting among the tables when","Great Expectations"
"I went in, and the landlord (which had a knowledge of me, and was a","Great Expectations"
"sporting one) called him out, and said, ‘I think this is a man that","Great Expectations"
"might suit you,’—meaning I was.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Compeyson, he looks at me very noticing, and I look at him. He has a","Great Expectations"
"watch and a chain and a ring and a breast-pin and a handsome suit of","Great Expectations"
"clothes.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“‘To judge from appearances, you’re out of luck,’ says Compeyson to me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“‘Yes, master, and I’ve never been in it much.’ (I had come out of","Great Expectations"
"Kingston Jail last on a vagrancy committal. Not but what it might have","Great Expectations"
"been for something else; but it warn’t.)","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“‘Luck changes,’ says Compeyson; ‘perhaps yours is going to change.’","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I says, ‘I hope it may be so. There’s room.’","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“‘What can you do?’ says Compeyson.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“‘Eat and drink,’ I says; ‘if you’ll find the materials.’","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Compeyson laughed, looked at me again very noticing, giv me five","Great Expectations"
"shillings, and appointed me for next night. Same place.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I went to Compeyson next night, same place, and Compeyson took me on","Great Expectations"
"to be his man and pardner. And what was Compeyson’s business in which","Great Expectations"
"we was to go pardners? Compeyson’s business was the swindling,","Great Expectations"
"handwriting forging, stolen bank-note passing, and such-like. All sorts","Great Expectations"
"of traps as Compeyson could set with his head, and keep his own legs","Great Expectations"
"out of and get the profits from and let another man in for, was","Great Expectations"
"Compeyson’s business. He’d no more heart than a iron file, he was as","Great Expectations"
"cold as death, and he had the head of the Devil afore mentioned.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“There was another in with Compeyson, as was called Arthur,—not as","Great Expectations"
"being so chrisen’d, but as a surname. He was in a Decline, and was a","Great Expectations"
"shadow to look at. Him and Compeyson had been in a bad thing with a","Great Expectations"
"rich lady some years afore, and they’d made a pot of money by it; but","Great Expectations"
"Compeyson betted and gamed, and he’d have run through the king’s taxes.","Great Expectations"
"So, Arthur was a dying, and a dying poor and with the horrors on him,","Great Expectations"
"and Compeyson’s wife (which Compeyson kicked mostly) was a having pity","Great Expectations"
"on him when she could, and Compeyson was a having pity on nothing and","Great Expectations"
"nobody.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I might a took warning by Arthur, but I didn’t; and I won’t pretend I","Great Expectations"
"was partick’ler—for where ’ud be the good on it, dear boy and comrade?","Great Expectations"
"So I begun wi’ Compeyson, and a poor tool I was in his hands. Arthur","Great Expectations"
"lived at the top of Compeyson’s house (over nigh Brentford it was), and","Great Expectations"
"Compeyson kept a careful account agen him for board and lodging, in","Great Expectations"
"case he should ever get better to work it out. But Arthur soon settled","Great Expectations"
"the account. The second or third time as ever I see him, he come a","Great Expectations"
"tearing down into Compeyson’s parlour late at night, in only a flannel","Great Expectations"
"gown, with his hair all in a sweat, and he says to Compeyson’s wife,","Great Expectations"
"‘Sally, she really is upstairs alonger me, now, and I can’t get rid of","Great Expectations"
"her. She’s all in white,’ he says, ‘wi’ white flowers in her hair, and","Great Expectations"
"she’s awful mad, and she’s got a shroud hanging over her arm, and she","Great Expectations"
"says she’ll put it on me at five in the morning.’","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Says Compeyson: ‘Why, you fool, don’t you know she’s got a living","Great Expectations"
"body? And how should she be up there, without coming through the door,","Great Expectations"
"or in at the window, and up the stairs?’","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“‘I don’t know how she’s there,’ says Arthur, shivering dreadful with","Great Expectations"
"the horrors, ‘but she’s standing in the corner at the foot of the bed,","Great Expectations"
"awful mad. And over where her heart’s broke—_you_ broke it!—there’s","Great Expectations"
"drops of blood.’","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Compeyson spoke hardy, but he was always a coward. ‘Go up alonger this","Great Expectations"
"drivelling sick man,’ he says to his wife, ‘and Magwitch, lend her a","Great Expectations"
"hand, will you?’ But he never come nigh himself.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Compeyson’s wife and me took him up to bed agen, and he raved most","Great Expectations"
"dreadful. ‘Why look at her!’ he cries out. ‘She’s a shaking the shroud","Great Expectations"
"at me! Don’t you see her? Look at her eyes! Ain’t it awful to see her","Great Expectations"
"so mad?’ Next he cries, ‘She’ll put it on me, and then I’m done for!","Great Expectations"
"Take it away from her, take it away!’ And then he catched hold of us,","Great Expectations"
"and kep on a talking to her, and answering of her, till I half believed","Great Expectations"
"I see her myself.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Compeyson’s wife, being used to him, giv him some liquor to get the","Great Expectations"
"horrors off, and by and by he quieted. ‘O, she’s gone! Has her keeper","Great Expectations"
"been for her?’ he says. ‘Yes,’ says Compeyson’s wife. ‘Did you tell him","Great Expectations"
"to lock her and bar her in?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘And to take that ugly thing away","Great Expectations"
"from her?’ ‘Yes, yes, all right.’ ‘You’re a good creetur,’ he says,","Great Expectations"
"‘don’t leave me, whatever you do, and thank you!’","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“He rested pretty quiet till it might want a few minutes of five, and","Great Expectations"
"then he starts up with a scream, and screams out, ‘Here she is! She’s","Great Expectations"
"got the shroud again. She’s unfolding it. She’s coming out of the","Great Expectations"
"corner. She’s coming to the bed. Hold me, both on you—one of each","Great Expectations"
"side—don’t let her touch me with it. Hah! she missed me that time.","Great Expectations"
"Don’t let her throw it over my shoulders. Don’t let her lift me up to","Great Expectations"
"get it round me. She’s lifting me up. Keep me down!’ Then he lifted","Great Expectations"
"himself up hard, and was dead.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Compeyson took it easy as a good riddance for both sides. Him and me","Great Expectations"
"was soon busy, and first he swore me (being ever artful) on my own","Great Expectations"
"book,—this here little black book, dear boy, what I swore your comrade","Great Expectations"
"on.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Not to go into the things that Compeyson planned, and I done—which ’ud","Great Expectations"
"take a week—I’ll simply say to you, dear boy, and Pip’s comrade, that","Great Expectations"
"that man got me into such nets as made me his black slave. I was always","Great Expectations"
"in debt to him, always under his thumb, always a working, always a","Great Expectations"
"getting into danger. He was younger than me, but he’d got craft, and","Great Expectations"
"he’d got learning, and he overmatched me five hundred times told and no","Great Expectations"
"mercy. My Missis as I had the hard time wi’—Stop though! I ain’t","Great Expectations"
"brought _her_ in—”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He looked about him in a confused way, as if he had lost his place in","Great Expectations"
"the book of his remembrance; and he turned his face to the fire, and","Great Expectations"
"spread his hands broader on his knees, and lifted them off and put them","Great Expectations"
"on again.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“There ain’t no need to go into it,” he said, looking round once more.","Great Expectations"
"“The time wi’ Compeyson was a’most as hard a time as ever I had; that","Great Expectations"
"said, all’s said. Did I tell you as I was tried, alone, for","Great Expectations"
"misdemeanor, while with Compeyson?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I answered, No.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well!” he said, “I _was_, and got convicted. As to took up on","Great Expectations"
"suspicion, that was twice or three times in the four or five year that","Great Expectations"
"it lasted; but evidence was wanting. At last, me and Compeyson was both","Great Expectations"
"committed for felony,—on a charge of putting stolen notes in","Great Expectations"
"circulation,—and there was other charges behind. Compeyson says to me,","Great Expectations"
"‘Separate defences, no communication,’ and that was all. And I was so","Great Expectations"
"miserable poor, that I sold all the clothes I had, except what hung on","Great Expectations"
"my back, afore I could get Jaggers.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“When we was put in the dock, I noticed first of all what a gentleman","Great Expectations"
"Compeyson looked, wi’ his curly hair and his black clothes and his","Great Expectations"
"white pocket-handkercher, and what a common sort of a wretch I looked.","Great Expectations"
"When the prosecution opened and the evidence was put short, aforehand,","Great Expectations"
"I noticed how heavy it all bore on me, and how light on him. When the","Great Expectations"
"evidence was giv in the box, I noticed how it was always me that had","Great Expectations"
"come for’ard, and could be swore to, how it was always me that the","Great Expectations"
"money had been paid to, how it was always me that had seemed to work","Great Expectations"
"the thing and get the profit. But when the defence come on, then I see","Great Expectations"
"the plan plainer; for, says the counsellor for Compeyson, ‘My lord and","Great Expectations"
"gentlemen, here you has afore you, side by side, two persons as your","Great Expectations"
"eyes can separate wide; one, the younger, well brought up, who will be","Great Expectations"
"spoke to as such; one, the elder, ill brought up, who will be spoke to","Great Expectations"
"as such; one, the younger, seldom if ever seen in these here","Great Expectations"
"transactions, and only suspected; t’other, the elder, always seen in","Great Expectations"
"’em and always wi’ his guilt brought home. Can you doubt, if there is","Great Expectations"
"but one in it, which is the one, and, if there is two in it, which is","Great Expectations"
"much the worst one?’ And such-like. And when it come to character,","Great Expectations"
"warn’t it Compeyson as had been to the school, and warn’t it his","Great Expectations"
"schoolfellows as was in this position and in that, and warn’t it him as","Great Expectations"
"had been know’d by witnesses in such clubs and societies, and nowt to","Great Expectations"
"his disadvantage? And warn’t it me as had been tried afore, and as had","Great Expectations"
"been know’d up hill and down dale in Bridewells and Lock-Ups! And when","Great Expectations"
"it come to speech-making, warn’t it Compeyson as could speak to ’em wi’","Great Expectations"
"his face dropping every now and then into his white","Great Expectations"
"pocket-handkercher,—ah! and wi’ verses in his speech, too,—and warn’t","Great Expectations"
"it me as could only say, ‘Gentlemen, this man at my side is a most","Great Expectations"
"precious rascal’? And when the verdict come, warn’t it Compeyson as was","Great Expectations"
"recommended to mercy on account of good character and bad company, and","Great Expectations"
"giving up all the information he could agen me, and warn’t it me as got","Great Expectations"
"never a word but Guilty? And when I says to Compeyson, ‘Once out of","Great Expectations"
"this court, I’ll smash that face of yourn!’ ain’t it Compeyson as prays","Great Expectations"
"the Judge to be protected, and gets two turnkeys stood betwixt us? And","Great Expectations"
"when we’re sentenced, ain’t it him as gets seven year, and me fourteen,","Great Expectations"
"and ain’t it him as the Judge is sorry for, because he might a done so","Great Expectations"
"well, and ain’t it me as the Judge perceives to be a old offender of","Great Expectations"
"wiolent passion, likely to come to worse?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He had worked himself into a state of great excitement, but he checked","Great Expectations"
"it, took two or three short breaths, swallowed as often, and stretching","Great Expectations"
"out his hand towards me said, in a reassuring manner, “I ain’t a-going","Great Expectations"
"to be low, dear boy!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He had so heated himself that he took out his handkerchief and wiped","Great Expectations"
"his face and head and neck and hands, before he could go on.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"[Illustration]","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I had said to Compeyson that I’d smash that face of his, and I swore","Great Expectations"
"Lord smash mine! to do it. We was in the same prison-ship, but I","Great Expectations"
"couldn’t get at him for long, though I tried. At last I come behind him","Great Expectations"
"and hit him on the cheek to turn him round and get a smashing one at","Great Expectations"
"him, when I was seen and seized. The black-hole of that ship warn’t a","Great Expectations"
"strong one, to a judge of black-holes that could swim and dive. I","Great Expectations"
"escaped to the shore, and I was a hiding among the graves there,","Great Expectations"
"envying them as was in ’em and all over, when I first see my boy!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He regarded me with a look of affection that made him almost abhorrent","Great Expectations"
"to me again, though I had felt great pity for him.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“By my boy, I was giv to understand as Compeyson was out on them","Great Expectations"
"marshes too. Upon my soul, I half believe he escaped in his terror, to","Great Expectations"
"get quit of me, not knowing it was me as had got ashore. I hunted him","Great Expectations"
"down. I smashed his face. ‘And now,’ says I ‘as the worst thing I can","Great Expectations"
"do, caring nothing for myself, I’ll drag you back.’ And I’d have swum","Great Expectations"
"off, towing him by the hair, if it had come to that, and I’d a got him","Great Expectations"
"aboard without the soldiers.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Of course he’d much the best of it to the last,—his character was so","Great Expectations"
"good. He had escaped when he was made half wild by me and my murderous","Great Expectations"
"intentions; and his punishment was light. I was put in irons, brought","Great Expectations"
"to trial again, and sent for life. I didn’t stop for life, dear boy and","Great Expectations"
"Pip’s comrade, being here.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He wiped himself again, as he had done before, and then slowly took his","Great Expectations"
"tangle of tobacco from his pocket, and plucked his pipe from his","Great Expectations"
"button-hole, and slowly filled it, and began to smoke.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Is he dead?” I asked, after a silence.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Is who dead, dear boy?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Compeyson.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“He hopes _I_ am, if he’s alive, you may be sure,” with a fierce look.","Great Expectations"
"“I never heerd no more of him.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Herbert had been writing with his pencil in the cover of a book. He","Great Expectations"
"softly pushed the book over to me, as Provis stood smoking with his","Great Expectations"
"eyes on the fire, and I read in it:—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Young Havisham’s name was Arthur. Compeyson is the man who professed","Great Expectations"
"to be Miss Havisham’s lover.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I shut the book and nodded slightly to Herbert, and put the book by;","Great Expectations"
"but we neither of us said anything, and both looked at Provis as he","Great Expectations"
"stood smoking by the fire.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Chapter XLIII.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Why should I pause to ask how much of my shrinking from Provis might be","Great Expectations"
"traced to Estella? Why should I loiter on my road, to compare the state","Great Expectations"
"of mind in which I had tried to rid myself of the stain of the prison","Great Expectations"
"before meeting her at the coach-office, with the state of mind in which","Great Expectations"
"I now reflected on the abyss between Estella in her pride and beauty,","Great Expectations"
"and the returned transport whom I harboured? The road would be none the","Great Expectations"
"smoother for it, the end would be none the better for it, he would not","Great Expectations"
"be helped, nor I extenuated.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"A new fear had been engendered in my mind by his narrative; or rather,","Great Expectations"
"his narrative had given form and purpose to the fear that was already","Great Expectations"
"there. If Compeyson were alive and should discover his return, I could","Great Expectations"
"hardly doubt the consequence. That Compeyson stood in mortal fear of","Great Expectations"
"him, neither of the two could know much better than I; and that any","Great Expectations"
"such man as that man had been described to be would hesitate to release","Great Expectations"
"himself for good from a dreaded enemy by the safe means of becoming an","Great Expectations"
"informer was scarcely to be imagined.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Never had I breathed, and never would I breathe—or so I resolved—a word","Great Expectations"
"of Estella to Provis. But, I said to Herbert that, before I could go","Great Expectations"
"abroad, I must see both Estella and Miss Havisham. This was when we","Great Expectations"
"were left alone on the night of the day when Provis told us his story.","Great Expectations"
"I resolved to go out to Richmond next day, and I went.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"On my presenting myself at Mrs. Brandley’s, Estella’s maid was called","Great Expectations"
"to tell that Estella had gone into the country. Where? To Satis House,","Great Expectations"
"as usual. Not as usual, I said, for she had never yet gone there","Great Expectations"
"without me; when was she coming back? There was an air of reservation","Great Expectations"
"in the answer which increased my perplexity, and the answer was, that","Great Expectations"
"her maid believed she was only coming back at all for a little while. I","Great Expectations"
"could make nothing of this, except that it was meant that I should make","Great Expectations"
"nothing of it, and I went home again in complete discomfiture.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Another night consultation with Herbert after Provis was gone home (I","Great Expectations"
"always took him home, and always looked well about me), led us to the","Great Expectations"
"conclusion that nothing should be said about going abroad until I came","Great Expectations"
"back from Miss Havisham’s. In the mean time, Herbert and I were to","Great Expectations"
"consider separately what it would be best to say; whether we should","Great Expectations"
"devise any pretence of being afraid that he was under suspicious","Great Expectations"
"observation; or whether I, who had never yet been abroad, should","Great Expectations"
"propose an expedition. We both knew that I had but to propose anything,","Great Expectations"
"and he would consent. We agreed that his remaining many days in his","Great Expectations"
"present hazard was not to be thought of.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Next day I had the meanness to feign that I was under a binding promise","Great Expectations"
"to go down to Joe; but I was capable of almost any meanness towards Joe","Great Expectations"
"or his name. Provis was to be strictly careful while I was gone, and","Great Expectations"
"Herbert was to take the charge of him that I had taken. I was to be","Great Expectations"
"absent only one night, and, on my return, the gratification of his","Great Expectations"
"impatience for my starting as a gentleman on a greater scale was to be","Great Expectations"
"begun. It occurred to me then, and as I afterwards found to Herbert","Great Expectations"
"also, that he might be best got away across the water, on that","Great Expectations"
"pretence,—as, to make purchases, or the like.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Having thus cleared the way for my expedition to Miss Havisham’s, I set","Great Expectations"
"off by the early morning coach before it was yet light, and was out on","Great Expectations"
"the open country road when the day came creeping on, halting and","Great Expectations"
"whimpering and shivering, and wrapped in patches of cloud and rags of","Great Expectations"
"mist, like a beggar. When we drove up to the Blue Boar after a drizzly","Great Expectations"
"ride, whom should I see come out under the gateway, toothpick in hand,","Great Expectations"
"to look at the coach, but Bentley Drummle!","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As he pretended not to see me, I pretended not to see him. It was a","Great Expectations"
"very lame pretence on both sides; the lamer, because we both went into","Great Expectations"
"the coffee-room, where he had just finished his breakfast, and where I","Great Expectations"
"ordered mine. It was poisonous to me to see him in the town, for I very","Great Expectations"
"well knew why he had come there.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Pretending to read a smeary newspaper long out of date, which had","Great Expectations"
"nothing half so legible in its local news, as the foreign matter of","Great Expectations"
"coffee, pickles, fish sauces, gravy, melted butter, and wine with which","Great Expectations"
"it was sprinkled all over, as if it had taken the measles in a highly","Great Expectations"
"irregular form, I sat at my table while he stood before the fire. By","Great Expectations"
"degrees it became an enormous injury to me that he stood before the","Great Expectations"
"fire. And I got up, determined to have my share of it. I had to put my","Great Expectations"
"hand behind his legs for the poker when I went up to the fireplace to","Great Expectations"
"stir the fire, but still pretended not to know him.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Is this a cut?” said Mr. Drummle.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Oh!” said I, poker in hand; “it’s you, is it? How do you do? I was","Great Expectations"
"wondering who it was, who kept the fire off.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"With that, I poked tremendously, and having done so, planted myself","Great Expectations"
"side by side with Mr. Drummle, my shoulders squared and my back to the","Great Expectations"
"fire.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You have just come down?” said Mr. Drummle, edging me a little away","Great Expectations"
"with his shoulder.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes,” said I, edging _him_ a little away with _my_ shoulder.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Beastly place,” said Drummle. “Your part of the country, I think?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes,” I assented. “I am told it’s very like your Shropshire.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Not in the least like it,” said Drummle.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Here Mr. Drummle looked at his boots and I looked at mine, and then Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Drummle looked at my boots, and I looked at his.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Have you been here long?” I asked, determined not to yield an inch of","Great Expectations"
"the fire.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Long enough to be tired of it,” returned Drummle, pretending to yawn,","Great Expectations"
"but equally determined.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Do you stay here long?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Can’t say,” answered Mr. Drummle. “Do you?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Can’t say,” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I felt here, through a tingling in my blood, that if Mr. Drummle’s","Great Expectations"
"shoulder had claimed another hair’s breadth of room, I should have","Great Expectations"
"jerked him into the window; equally, that if my own shoulder had urged","Great Expectations"
"a similar claim, Mr. Drummle would have jerked me into the nearest box.","Great Expectations"
"He whistled a little. So did I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Large tract of marshes about here, I believe?” said Drummle.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes. What of that?” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Drummle looked at me, and then at my boots, and then said, “Oh!”","Great Expectations"
"and laughed.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Are you amused, Mr. Drummle?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No,” said he, “not particularly. I am going out for a ride in the","Great Expectations"
"saddle. I mean to explore those marshes for amusement. Out-of-the-way","Great Expectations"
"villages there, they tell me. Curious little public-houses—and","Great Expectations"
"smithies—and that. Waiter!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, sir.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Is that horse of mine ready?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Brought round to the door, sir.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I say. Look here, you sir. The lady won’t ride to-day; the weather","Great Expectations"
"won’t do.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Very good, sir.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And I don’t dine, because I’m going to dine at the lady’s.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Very good, sir.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Then, Drummle glanced at me, with an insolent triumph on his","Great Expectations"
"great-jowled face that cut me to the heart, dull as he was, and so","Great Expectations"
"exasperated me, that I felt inclined to take him in my arms (as the","Great Expectations"
"robber in the story-book is said to have taken the old lady) and seat","Great Expectations"
"him on the fire.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"One thing was manifest to both of us, and that was, that until relief","Great Expectations"
"came, neither of us could relinquish the fire. There we stood, well","Great Expectations"
"squared up before it, shoulder to shoulder and foot to foot, with our","Great Expectations"
"hands behind us, not budging an inch. The horse was visible outside in","Great Expectations"
"the drizzle at the door, my breakfast was put on the table, Drummle’s","Great Expectations"
"was cleared away, the waiter invited me to begin, I nodded, we both","Great Expectations"
"stood our ground.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Have you been to the Grove since?” said Drummle.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No,” said I, “I had quite enough of the Finches the last time I was","Great Expectations"
"there.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Was that when we had a difference of opinion?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes,” I replied, very shortly.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Come, come! They let you off easily enough,” sneered Drummle. “You","Great Expectations"
"shouldn’t have lost your temper.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Mr. Drummle,” said I, “you are not competent to give advice on that","Great Expectations"
"subject. When I lose my temper (not that I admit having done so on that","Great Expectations"
"occasion), I don’t throw glasses.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I do,” said Drummle.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"After glancing at him once or twice, in an increased state of","Great Expectations"
"smouldering ferocity, I said,—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Mr. Drummle, I did not seek this conversation, and I don’t think it an","Great Expectations"
"agreeable one.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I am sure it’s not,” said he, superciliously over his shoulder; “I","Great Expectations"
"don’t think anything about it.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And therefore,” I went on, “with your leave, I will suggest that we","Great Expectations"
"hold no kind of communication in future.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Quite my opinion,” said Drummle, “and what I should have suggested","Great Expectations"
"myself, or done—more likely—without suggesting. But don’t lose your","Great Expectations"
"temper. Haven’t you lost enough without that?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What do you mean, sir?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Waiter!” said Drummle, by way of answering me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The waiter reappeared.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Look here, you sir. You quite understand that the young lady don’t","Great Expectations"
"ride to-day, and that I dine at the young lady’s?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Quite so, sir!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"When the waiter had felt my fast-cooling teapot with the palm of his","Great Expectations"
"hand, and had looked imploringly at me, and had gone out, Drummle,","Great Expectations"
"careful not to move the shoulder next me, took a cigar from his pocket","Great Expectations"
"and bit the end off, but showed no sign of stirring. Choking and","Great Expectations"
"boiling as I was, I felt that we could not go a word further, without","Great Expectations"
"introducing Estella’s name, which I could not endure to hear him utter;","Great Expectations"
"and therefore I looked stonily at the opposite wall, as if there were","Great Expectations"
"no one present, and forced myself to silence. How long we might have","Great Expectations"
"remained in this ridiculous position it is impossible to say, but for","Great Expectations"
"the incursion of three thriving farmers—laid on by the waiter, I","Great Expectations"
"think—who came into the coffee-room unbuttoning their great-coats and","Great Expectations"
"rubbing their hands, and before whom, as they charged at the fire, we","Great Expectations"
"were obliged to give way.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I saw him through the window, seizing his horse’s mane, and mounting in","Great Expectations"
"his blundering brutal manner, and sidling and backing away. I thought","Great Expectations"
"he was gone, when he came back, calling for a light for the cigar in","Great Expectations"
"his mouth, which he had forgotten. A man in a dust-coloured dress","Great Expectations"
"appeared with what was wanted,—I could not have said from where:","Great Expectations"
"whether from the inn yard, or the street, or where not,—and as Drummle","Great Expectations"
"leaned down from the saddle and lighted his cigar and laughed, with a","Great Expectations"
"jerk of his head towards the coffee-room windows, the slouching","Great Expectations"
"shoulders and ragged hair of this man whose back was towards me","Great Expectations"
"reminded me of Orlick.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Too heavily out of sorts to care much at the time whether it were he or","Great Expectations"
"no, or after all to touch the breakfast, I washed the weather and the","Great Expectations"
"journey from my face and hands, and went out to the memorable old house","Great Expectations"
"that it would have been so much the better for me never to have","Great Expectations"
"entered, never to have seen.","Great Expectations"

"Chapter XLIV.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"In the room where the dressing-table stood, and where the wax-candles","Great Expectations"
"burnt on the wall, I found Miss Havisham and Estella; Miss Havisham","Great Expectations"
"seated on a settee near the fire, and Estella on a cushion at her feet.","Great Expectations"
"Estella was knitting, and Miss Havisham was looking on. They both","Great Expectations"
"raised their eyes as I went in, and both saw an alteration in me. I","Great Expectations"
"derived that, from the look they interchanged.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And what wind,” said Miss Havisham, “blows you here, Pip?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Though she looked steadily at me, I saw that she was rather confused.","Great Expectations"
"Estella, pausing a moment in her knitting with her eyes upon me, and","Great Expectations"
"then going on, I fancied that I read in the action of her fingers, as","Great Expectations"
"plainly as if she had told me in the dumb alphabet, that she perceived","Great Expectations"
"I had discovered my real benefactor.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Miss Havisham,” said I, “I went to Richmond yesterday, to speak to","Great Expectations"
"Estella; and finding that some wind had blown _her_ here, I followed.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Miss Havisham motioning to me for the third or fourth time to sit down,","Great Expectations"
"I took the chair by the dressing-table, which I had often seen her","Great Expectations"
"occupy. With all that ruin at my feet and about me, it seemed a natural","Great Expectations"
"place for me, that day.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What I had to say to Estella, Miss Havisham, I will say before you,","Great Expectations"
"presently—in a few moments. It will not surprise you, it will not","Great Expectations"
"displease you. I am as unhappy as you can ever have meant me to be.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Miss Havisham continued to look steadily at me. I could see in the","Great Expectations"
"action of Estella’s fingers as they worked that she attended to what I","Great Expectations"
"said; but she did not look up.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I have found out who my patron is. It is not a fortunate discovery,","Great Expectations"
"and is not likely ever to enrich me in reputation, station, fortune,","Great Expectations"
"anything. There are reasons why I must say no more of that. It is not","Great Expectations"
"my secret, but another’s.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As I was silent for a while, looking at Estella and considering how to","Great Expectations"
"go on, Miss Havisham repeated, “It is not your secret, but another’s.","Great Expectations"
"Well?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“When you first caused me to be brought here, Miss Havisham, when I","Great Expectations"
"belonged to the village over yonder, that I wish I had never left, I","Great Expectations"
"suppose I did really come here, as any other chance boy might have","Great Expectations"
"come,—as a kind of servant, to gratify a want or a whim, and to be paid","Great Expectations"
"for it?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Ay, Pip,” replied Miss Havisham, steadily nodding her head; “you did.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And that Mr. Jaggers—”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Mr. Jaggers,” said Miss Havisham, taking me up in a firm tone, “had","Great Expectations"
"nothing to do with it, and knew nothing of it. His being my lawyer, and","Great Expectations"
"his being the lawyer of your patron is a coincidence. He holds the same","Great Expectations"
"relation towards numbers of people, and it might easily arise. Be that","Great Expectations"
"as it may, it did arise, and was not brought about by any one.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Any one might have seen in her haggard face that there was no","Great Expectations"
"suppression or evasion so far.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“But when I fell into the mistake I have so long remained in, at least","Great Expectations"
"you led me on?” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes,” she returned, again nodding steadily, “I let you go on.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Was that kind?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Who am I,” cried Miss Havisham, striking her stick upon the floor and","Great Expectations"
"flashing into wrath so suddenly that Estella glanced up at her in","Great Expectations"
"surprise,—“who am I, for God’s sake, that I should be kind?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was a weak complaint to have made, and I had not meant to make it. I","Great Expectations"
"told her so, as she sat brooding after this outburst.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well, well, well!” she said. “What else?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I was liberally paid for my old attendance here,” I said, to soothe","Great Expectations"
"her, “in being apprenticed, and I have asked these questions only for","Great Expectations"
"my own information. What follows has another (and I hope more","Great Expectations"
"disinterested) purpose. In humouring my mistake, Miss Havisham, you","Great Expectations"
"punished—practised on—perhaps you will supply whatever term expresses","Great Expectations"
"your intention, without offence—your self-seeking relations?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I did. Why, they would have it so! So would you. What has been my","Great Expectations"
"history, that I should be at the pains of entreating either them or you","Great Expectations"
"not to have it so! You made your own snares. _I_ never made them.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Waiting until she was quiet again,—for this, too, flashed out of her in","Great Expectations"
"a wild and sudden way,—I went on.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I have been thrown among one family of your relations, Miss Havisham,","Great Expectations"
"and have been constantly among them since I went to London. I know them","Great Expectations"
"to have been as honestly under my delusion as I myself. And I should be","Great Expectations"
"false and base if I did not tell you, whether it is acceptable to you","Great Expectations"
"or no, and whether you are inclined to give credence to it or no, that","Great Expectations"
"you deeply wrong both Mr. Matthew Pocket and his son Herbert, if you","Great Expectations"
"suppose them to be otherwise than generous, upright, open, and","Great Expectations"
"incapable of anything designing or mean.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“They are your friends,” said Miss Havisham.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“They made themselves my friends,” said I, “when they supposed me to","Great Expectations"
"have superseded them; and when Sarah Pocket, Miss Georgiana, and","Great Expectations"
"Mistress Camilla were not my friends, I think.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"This contrasting of them with the rest seemed, I was glad to see, to do","Great Expectations"
"them good with her. She looked at me keenly for a little while, and","Great Expectations"
"then said quietly,—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What do you want for them?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Only,” said I, “that you would not confound them with the others. They","Great Expectations"
"may be of the same blood, but, believe me, they are not of the same","Great Expectations"
"nature.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Still looking at me keenly, Miss Havisham repeated,—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What do you want for them?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I am not so cunning, you see,” I said, in answer, conscious that I","Great Expectations"
"reddened a little, “as that I could hide from you, even if I desired,","Great Expectations"
"that I do want something. Miss Havisham, if you would spare the money","Great Expectations"
"to do my friend Herbert a lasting service in life, but which from the","Great Expectations"
"nature of the case must be done without his knowledge, I could show you","Great Expectations"
"how.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Why must it be done without his knowledge?” she asked, settling her","Great Expectations"
"hands upon her stick, that she might regard me the more attentively.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Because,” said I, “I began the service myself, more than two years","Great Expectations"
"ago, without his knowledge, and I don’t want to be betrayed. Why I fail","Great Expectations"
"in my ability to finish it, I cannot explain. It is a part of the","Great Expectations"
"secret which is another person’s and not mine.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"She gradually withdrew her eyes from me, and turned them on the fire.","Great Expectations"
"After watching it for what appeared in the silence and by the light of","Great Expectations"
"the slowly wasting candles to be a long time, she was roused by the","Great Expectations"
"collapse of some of the red coals, and looked towards me again—at","Great Expectations"
"first, vacantly—then, with a gradually concentrating attention. All","Great Expectations"
"this time Estella knitted on. When Miss Havisham had fixed her","Great Expectations"
"attention on me, she said, speaking as if there had been no lapse in","Great Expectations"
"our dialogue,—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What else?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Estella,” said I, turning to her now, and trying to command my","Great Expectations"
"trembling voice, “you know I love you. You know that I have loved you","Great Expectations"
"long and dearly.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"She raised her eyes to my face, on being thus addressed, and her","Great Expectations"
"fingers plied their work, and she looked at me with an unmoved","Great Expectations"
"countenance. I saw that Miss Havisham glanced from me to her, and from","Great Expectations"
"her to me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I should have said this sooner, but for my long mistake. It induced me","Great Expectations"
"to hope that Miss Havisham meant us for one another. While I thought","Great Expectations"
"you could not help yourself, as it were, I refrained from saying it.","Great Expectations"
"But I must say it now.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Preserving her unmoved countenance, and with her fingers still going,","Great Expectations"
"Estella shook her head.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I know,” said I, in answer to that action,—“I know. I have no hope","Great Expectations"
"that I shall ever call you mine, Estella. I am ignorant what may become","Great Expectations"
"of me very soon, how poor I may be, or where I may go. Still, I love","Great Expectations"
"you. I have loved you ever since I first saw you in this house.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Looking at me perfectly unmoved and with her fingers busy, she shook","Great Expectations"
"her head again.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It would have been cruel in Miss Havisham, horribly cruel, to practise","Great Expectations"
"on the susceptibility of a poor boy, and to torture me through all","Great Expectations"
"these years with a vain hope and an idle pursuit, if she had reflected","Great Expectations"
"on the gravity of what she did. But I think she did not. I think that,","Great Expectations"
"in the endurance of her own trial, she forgot mine, Estella.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I saw Miss Havisham put her hand to her heart and hold it there, as she","Great Expectations"
"sat looking by turns at Estella and at me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It seems,” said Estella, very calmly, “that there are sentiments,","Great Expectations"
"fancies,—I don’t know how to call them,—which I am not able to","Great Expectations"
"comprehend. When you say you love me, I know what you mean, as a form","Great Expectations"
"of words; but nothing more. You address nothing in my breast, you touch","Great Expectations"
"nothing there. I don’t care for what you say at all. I have tried to","Great Expectations"
"warn you of this; now, have I not?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I said in a miserable manner, “Yes.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes. But you would not be warned, for you thought I did not mean it.","Great Expectations"
"Now, did you not think so?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I thought and hoped you could not mean it. You, so young, untried, and","Great Expectations"
"beautiful, Estella! Surely it is not in Nature.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It is in _my_ nature,” she returned. And then she added, with a stress","Great Expectations"
"upon the words, “It is in the nature formed within me. I make a great","Great Expectations"
"difference between you and all other people when I say so much. I can","Great Expectations"
"do no more.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Is it not true,” said I, “that Bentley Drummle is in town here, and","Great Expectations"
"pursuing you?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It is quite true,” she replied, referring to him with the indifference","Great Expectations"
"of utter contempt.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“That you encourage him, and ride out with him, and that he dines with","Great Expectations"
"you this very day?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"She seemed a little surprised that I should know it, but again replied,","Great Expectations"
"“Quite true.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You cannot love him, Estella!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Her fingers stopped for the first time, as she retorted rather angrily,","Great Expectations"
"“What have I told you? Do you still think, in spite of it, that I do","Great Expectations"
"not mean what I say?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You would never marry him, Estella?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"She looked towards Miss Havisham, and considered for a moment with her","Great Expectations"
"work in her hands. Then she said, “Why not tell you the truth? I am","Great Expectations"
"going to be married to him.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I dropped my face into my hands, but was able to control myself better","Great Expectations"
"than I could have expected, considering what agony it gave me to hear","Great Expectations"
"her say those words. When I raised my face again, there was such a","Great Expectations"
"ghastly look upon Miss Havisham’s, that it impressed me, even in my","Great Expectations"
"passionate hurry and grief.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Estella, dearest Estella, do not let Miss Havisham lead you into this","Great Expectations"
"fatal step. Put me aside for ever,—you have done so, I well know,—but","Great Expectations"
"bestow yourself on some worthier person than Drummle. Miss Havisham","Great Expectations"
"gives you to him, as the greatest slight and injury that could be done","Great Expectations"
"to the many far better men who admire you, and to the few who truly","Great Expectations"
"love you. Among those few there may be one who loves you even as","Great Expectations"
"dearly, though he has not loved you as long, as I. Take him, and I can","Great Expectations"
"bear it better, for your sake!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"My earnestness awoke a wonder in her that seemed as if it would have","Great Expectations"
"been touched with compassion, if she could have rendered me at all","Great Expectations"
"intelligible to her own mind.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I am going,” she said again, in a gentler voice, “to be married to","Great Expectations"
"him. The preparations for my marriage are making, and I shall be","Great Expectations"
"married soon. Why do you injuriously introduce the name of my mother by","Great Expectations"
"adoption? It is my own act.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Your own act, Estella, to fling yourself away upon a brute?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“On whom should I fling myself away?” she retorted, with a smile.","Great Expectations"
"“Should I fling myself away upon the man who would the soonest feel (if","Great Expectations"
"people do feel such things) that I took nothing to him? There! It is","Great Expectations"
"done. I shall do well enough, and so will my husband. As to leading me","Great Expectations"
"into what you call this fatal step, Miss Havisham would have had me","Great Expectations"
"wait, and not marry yet; but I am tired of the life I have led, which","Great Expectations"
"has very few charms for me, and I am willing enough to change it. Say","Great Expectations"
"no more. We shall never understand each other.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Such a mean brute, such a stupid brute!” I urged, in despair.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Don’t be afraid of my being a blessing to him,” said Estella; “I shall","Great Expectations"
"not be that. Come! Here is my hand. Do we part on this, you visionary","Great Expectations"
"boy—or man?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“O Estella!” I answered, as my bitter tears fell fast on her hand, do","Great Expectations"
"what I would to restrain them; “even if I remained in England and could","Great Expectations"
"hold my head up with the rest, how could I see you Drummle’s wife?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Nonsense,” she returned,—“nonsense. This will pass in no time.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Never, Estella!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You will get me out of your thoughts in a week.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Out of my thoughts! You are part of my existence, part of myself. You","Great Expectations"
"have been in every line I have ever read since I first came here, the","Great Expectations"
"rough common boy whose poor heart you wounded even then. You have been","Great Expectations"
"in every prospect I have ever seen since,—on the river, on the sails of","Great Expectations"
"the ships, on the marshes, in the clouds, in the light, in the","Great Expectations"
"darkness, in the wind, in the woods, in the sea, in the streets. You","Great Expectations"
"have been the embodiment of every graceful fancy that my mind has ever","Great Expectations"
"become acquainted with. The stones of which the strongest London","Great Expectations"
"buildings are made are not more real, or more impossible to be","Great Expectations"
"displaced by your hands, than your presence and influence have been to","Great Expectations"
"me, there and everywhere, and will be. Estella, to the last hour of my","Great Expectations"
"life, you cannot choose but remain part of my character, part of the","Great Expectations"
"little good in me, part of the evil. But, in this separation, I","Great Expectations"
"associate you only with the good; and I will faithfully hold you to","Great Expectations"
"that always, for you must have done me far more good than harm, let me","Great Expectations"
"feel now what sharp distress I may. O God bless you, God forgive you!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"In what ecstasy of unhappiness I got these broken words out of myself,","Great Expectations"
"I don’t know. The rhapsody welled up within me, like blood from an","Great Expectations"
"inward wound, and gushed out. I held her hand to my lips some lingering","Great Expectations"
"moments, and so I left her. But ever afterwards, I remembered,—and soon","Great Expectations"
"afterwards with stronger reason,—that while Estella looked at me merely","Great Expectations"
"with incredulous wonder, the spectral figure of Miss Havisham, her hand","Great Expectations"
"still covering her heart, seemed all resolved into a ghastly stare of","Great Expectations"
"pity and remorse.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"All done, all gone! So much was done and gone, that when I went out at","Great Expectations"
"the gate, the light of the day seemed of a darker colour than when I","Great Expectations"
"went in. For a while, I hid myself among some lanes and by-paths, and","Great Expectations"
"then struck off to walk all the way to London. For, I had by that time","Great Expectations"
"come to myself so far as to consider that I could not go back to the","Great Expectations"
"inn and see Drummle there; that I could not bear to sit upon the coach","Great Expectations"
"and be spoken to; that I could do nothing half so good for myself as","Great Expectations"
"tire myself out.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was past midnight when I crossed London Bridge. Pursuing the narrow","Great Expectations"
"intricacies of the streets which at that time tended westward near the","Great Expectations"
"Middlesex shore of the river, my readiest access to the Temple was","Great Expectations"
"close by the river-side, through Whitefriars. I was not expected till","Great Expectations"
"to-morrow; but I had my keys, and, if Herbert were gone to bed, could","Great Expectations"
"get to bed myself without disturbing him.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As it seldom happened that I came in at that Whitefriars gate after the","Great Expectations"
"Temple was closed, and as I was very muddy and weary, I did not take it","Great Expectations"
"ill that the night-porter examined me with much attention as he held","Great Expectations"
"the gate a little way open for me to pass in. To help his memory I","Great Expectations"
"mentioned my name.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I was not quite sure, sir, but I thought so. Here’s a note, sir. The","Great Expectations"
"messenger that brought it, said would you be so good as read it by my","Great Expectations"
"lantern?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"[Illustration]","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Much surprised by the request, I took the note. It was directed to","Great Expectations"
"Philip Pip, Esquire, and on the top of the superscription were the","Great Expectations"
"words, “PLEASE READ THIS, HERE.” I opened it, the watchman holding up","Great Expectations"
"his light, and read inside, in Wemmick’s writing,—","Great Expectations"

"Chapter XLV.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Turning from the Temple gate as soon as I had read the warning, I made","Great Expectations"
"the best of my way to Fleet Street, and there got a late hackney","Great Expectations"
"chariot and drove to the Hummums in Covent Garden. In those times a bed","Great Expectations"
"was always to be got there at any hour of the night, and the","Great Expectations"
"chamberlain, letting me in at his ready wicket, lighted the candle next","Great Expectations"
"in order on his shelf, and showed me straight into the bedroom next in","Great Expectations"
"order on his list. It was a sort of vault on the ground floor at the","Great Expectations"
"back, with a despotic monster of a four-post bedstead in it, straddling","Great Expectations"
"over the whole place, putting one of his arbitrary legs into the","Great Expectations"
"fireplace and another into the doorway, and squeezing the wretched","Great Expectations"
"little washing-stand in quite a Divinely Righteous manner.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As I had asked for a night-light, the chamberlain had brought me in,","Great Expectations"
"before he left me, the good old constitutional rushlight of those","Great Expectations"
"virtuous days—an object like the ghost of a walking-cane, which","Great Expectations"
"instantly broke its back if it were touched, which nothing could ever","Great Expectations"
"be lighted at, and which was placed in solitary confinement at the","Great Expectations"
"bottom of a high tin tower, perforated with round holes that made a","Great Expectations"
"staringly wide-awake pattern on the walls. When I had got into bed, and","Great Expectations"
"lay there footsore, weary, and wretched, I found that I could no more","Great Expectations"
"close my own eyes than I could close the eyes of this foolish Argus.","Great Expectations"
"And thus, in the gloom and death of the night, we stared at one","Great Expectations"
"another.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"What a doleful night! How anxious, how dismal, how long! There was an","Great Expectations"
"inhospitable smell in the room, of cold soot and hot dust; and, as I","Great Expectations"
"looked up into the corners of the tester over my head, I thought what a","Great Expectations"
"number of blue-bottle flies from the butchers’, and earwigs from the","Great Expectations"
"market, and grubs from the country, must be holding on up there, lying","Great Expectations"
"by for next summer. This led me to speculate whether any of them ever","Great Expectations"
"tumbled down, and then I fancied that I felt light falls on my face,—a","Great Expectations"
"disagreeable turn of thought, suggesting other and more objectionable","Great Expectations"
"approaches up my back. When I had lain awake a little while, those","Great Expectations"
"extraordinary voices with which silence teems began to make themselves","Great Expectations"
"audible. The closet whispered, the fireplace sighed, the little","Great Expectations"
"washing-stand ticked, and one guitar-string played occasionally in the","Great Expectations"
"chest of drawers. At about the same time, the eyes on the wall acquired","Great Expectations"
"a new expression, and in every one of those staring rounds I saw","Great Expectations"
"written, DON’T GO HOME.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Whatever night-fancies and night-noises crowded on me, they never","Great Expectations"
"warded off this DON’T GO HOME. It plaited itself into whatever I","Great Expectations"
"thought of, as a bodily pain would have done. Not long before, I had","Great Expectations"
"read in the newspapers, how a gentleman unknown had come to the Hummums","Great Expectations"
"in the night, and had gone to bed, and had destroyed himself, and had","Great Expectations"
"been found in the morning weltering in blood. It came into my head that","Great Expectations"
"he must have occupied this very vault of mine, and I got out of bed to","Great Expectations"
"assure myself that there were no red marks about; then opened the door","Great Expectations"
"to look out into the passages, and cheer myself with the companionship","Great Expectations"
"of a distant light, near which I knew the chamberlain to be dozing. But","Great Expectations"
"all this time, why I was not to go home, and what had happened at home,","Great Expectations"
"and when I should go home, and whether Provis was safe at home, were","Great Expectations"
"questions occupying my mind so busily, that one might have supposed","Great Expectations"
"there could be no more room in it for any other theme. Even when I","Great Expectations"
"thought of Estella, and how we had parted that day forever, and when I","Great Expectations"
"recalled all the circumstances of our parting, and all her looks and","Great Expectations"
"tones, and the action of her fingers while she knitted,—even then I was","Great Expectations"
"pursuing, here and there and everywhere, the caution, Don’t go home.","Great Expectations"
"When at last I dozed, in sheer exhaustion of mind and body, it became a","Great Expectations"
"vast shadowy verb which I had to conjugate. Imperative mood, present","Great Expectations"
"tense: Do not thou go home, let him not go home, let us not go home, do","Great Expectations"
"not ye or you go home, let not them go home. Then potentially: I may","Great Expectations"
"not and I cannot go home; and I might not, could not, would not, and","Great Expectations"
"should not go home; until I felt that I was going distracted, and","Great Expectations"
"rolled over on the pillow, and looked at the staring rounds upon the","Great Expectations"
"wall again.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I had left directions that I was to be called at seven; for it was","Great Expectations"
"plain that I must see Wemmick before seeing any one else, and equally","Great Expectations"
"plain that this was a case in which his Walworth sentiments only could","Great Expectations"
"be taken. It was a relief to get out of the room where the night had","Great Expectations"
"been so miserable, and I needed no second knocking at the door to","Great Expectations"
"startle me from my uneasy bed.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The Castle battlements arose upon my view at eight o’clock. The little","Great Expectations"
"servant happening to be entering the fortress with two hot rolls, I","Great Expectations"
"passed through the postern and crossed the drawbridge in her company,","Great Expectations"
"and so came without announcement into the presence of Wemmick as he was","Great Expectations"
"making tea for himself and the Aged. An open door afforded a","Great Expectations"
"perspective view of the Aged in bed.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Halloa, Mr. Pip!” said Wemmick. “You did come home, then?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes,” I returned; “but I didn’t go home.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“That’s all right,” said he, rubbing his hands. “I left a note for you","Great Expectations"
"at each of the Temple gates, on the chance. Which gate did you come","Great Expectations"
"to?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I told him.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I’ll go round to the others in the course of the day and destroy the","Great Expectations"
"notes,” said Wemmick; “it’s a good rule never to leave documentary","Great Expectations"
"evidence if you can help it, because you don’t know when it may be put","Great Expectations"
"in. I’m going to take a liberty with you. _Would_ you mind toasting","Great Expectations"
"this sausage for the Aged P.?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I said I should be delighted to do it.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Then you can go about your work, Mary Anne,” said Wemmick to the","Great Expectations"
"little servant; “which leaves us to ourselves, don’t you see, Mr. Pip?”","Great Expectations"
"he added, winking, as she disappeared.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I thanked him for his friendship and caution, and our discourse","Great Expectations"
"proceeded in a low tone, while I toasted the Aged’s sausage and he","Great Expectations"
"buttered the crumb of the Aged’s roll.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Now, Mr. Pip, you know,” said Wemmick, “you and I understand one","Great Expectations"
"another. We are in our private and personal capacities, and we have","Great Expectations"
"been engaged in a confidential transaction before to-day. Official","Great Expectations"
"sentiments are one thing. We are extra official.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I cordially assented. I was so very nervous, that I had already lighted","Great Expectations"
"the Aged’s sausage like a torch, and been obliged to blow it out.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I accidentally heard, yesterday morning,” said Wemmick, “being in a","Great Expectations"
"certain place where I once took you,—even between you and me, it’s as","Great Expectations"
"well not to mention names when avoidable—”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Much better not,” said I. “I understand you.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I heard there by chance, yesterday morning,” said Wemmick, “that a","Great Expectations"
"certain person not altogether of uncolonial pursuits, and not","Great Expectations"
"unpossessed of portable property,—I don’t know who it may really be,—we","Great Expectations"
"won’t name this person—”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Not necessary,” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“—Had made some little stir in a certain part of the world where a good","Great Expectations"
"many people go, not always in gratification of their own inclinations,","Great Expectations"
"and not quite irrespective of the government expense—”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"In watching his face, I made quite a firework of the Aged’s sausage,","Great Expectations"
"and greatly discomposed both my own attention and Wemmick’s; for which","Great Expectations"
"I apologised.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“—By disappearing from such place, and being no more heard of","Great Expectations"
"thereabouts. From which,” said Wemmick, “conjectures had been raised","Great Expectations"
"and theories formed. I also heard that you at your chambers in Garden","Great Expectations"
"Court, Temple, had been watched, and might be watched again.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“By whom?” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I wouldn’t go into that,” said Wemmick, evasively, “it might clash","Great Expectations"
"with official responsibilities. I heard it, as I have in my time heard","Great Expectations"
"other curious things in the same place. I don’t tell it you on","Great Expectations"
"information received. I heard it.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He took the toasting-fork and sausage from me as he spoke, and set","Great Expectations"
"forth the Aged’s breakfast neatly on a little tray. Previous to placing","Great Expectations"
"it before him, he went into the Aged’s room with a clean white cloth,","Great Expectations"
"and tied the same under the old gentleman’s chin, and propped him up,","Great Expectations"
"and put his nightcap on one side, and gave him quite a rakish air. Then","Great Expectations"
"he placed his breakfast before him with great care, and said, “All","Great Expectations"
"right, ain’t you, Aged P.?” To which the cheerful Aged replied, “All","Great Expectations"
"right, John, my boy, all right!” As there seemed to be a tacit","Great Expectations"
"understanding that the Aged was not in a presentable state, and was","Great Expectations"
"therefore to be considered invisible, I made a pretence of being in","Great Expectations"
"complete ignorance of these proceedings.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“This watching of me at my chambers (which I have once had reason to","Great Expectations"
"suspect),” I said to Wemmick when he came back, “is inseparable from","Great Expectations"
"the person to whom you have adverted; is it?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Wemmick looked very serious. “I couldn’t undertake to say that, of my","Great Expectations"
"own knowledge. I mean, I couldn’t undertake to say it was at first. But","Great Expectations"
"it either is, or it will be, or it’s in great danger of being.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As I saw that he was restrained by fealty to Little Britain from saying","Great Expectations"
"as much as he could, and as I knew with thankfulness to him how far out","Great Expectations"
"of his way he went to say what he did, I could not press him. But I","Great Expectations"
"told him, after a little meditation over the fire, that I would like to","Great Expectations"
"ask him a question, subject to his answering or not answering, as he","Great Expectations"
"deemed right, and sure that his course would be right. He paused in his","Great Expectations"
"breakfast, and crossing his arms, and pinching his shirt-sleeves (his","Great Expectations"
"notion of in-door comfort was to sit without any coat), he nodded to me","Great Expectations"
"once, to put my question.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You have heard of a man of bad character, whose true name is","Great Expectations"
"Compeyson?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He answered with one other nod.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Is he living?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"One other nod.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Is he in London?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He gave me one other nod, compressed the post-office exceedingly, gave","Great Expectations"
"me one last nod, and went on with his breakfast.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Now,” said Wemmick, “questioning being over,” which he emphasised and","Great Expectations"
"repeated for my guidance, “I come to what I did, after hearing what I","Great Expectations"
"heard. I went to Garden Court to find you; not finding you, I went to","Great Expectations"
"Clarriker’s to find Mr. Herbert.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And him you found?” said I, with great anxiety.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And him I found. Without mentioning any names or going into any","Great Expectations"
"details, I gave him to understand that if he was aware of anybody—Tom,","Great Expectations"
"Jack, or Richard—being about the chambers, or about the immediate","Great Expectations"
"neighbourhood, he had better get Tom, Jack, or Richard out of the way","Great Expectations"
"while you were out of the way.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“He would be greatly puzzled what to do?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“He _was_ puzzled what to do; not the less, because I gave him my","Great Expectations"
"opinion that it was not safe to try to get Tom, Jack, or Richard too","Great Expectations"
"far out of the way at present. Mr. Pip, I’ll tell you something. Under","Great Expectations"
"existing circumstances, there is no place like a great city when you","Great Expectations"
"are once in it. Don’t break cover too soon. Lie close. Wait till things","Great Expectations"
"slacken, before you try the open, even for foreign air.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I thanked him for his valuable advice, and asked him what Herbert had","Great Expectations"
"done?","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Mr. Herbert,” said Wemmick, “after being all of a heap for half an","Great Expectations"
"hour, struck out a plan. He mentioned to me as a secret, that he is","Great Expectations"
"courting a young lady who has, as no doubt you are aware, a bedridden","Great Expectations"
"Pa. Which Pa, having been in the Purser line of life, lies a-bed in a","Great Expectations"
"bow-window where he can see the ships sail up and down the river. You","Great Expectations"
"are acquainted with the young lady, most probably?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Not personally,” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The truth was, that she had objected to me as an expensive companion","Great Expectations"
"who did Herbert no good, and that, when Herbert had first proposed to","Great Expectations"
"present me to her, she had received the proposal with such very","Great Expectations"
"moderate warmth, that Herbert had felt himself obliged to confide the","Great Expectations"
"state of the case to me, with a view to the lapse of a little time","Great Expectations"
"before I made her acquaintance. When I had begun to advance Herbert’s","Great Expectations"
"prospects by stealth, I had been able to bear this with cheerful","Great Expectations"
"philosophy: he and his affianced, for their part, had naturally not","Great Expectations"
"been very anxious to introduce a third person into their interviews;","Great Expectations"
"and thus, although I was assured that I had risen in Clara’s esteem,","Great Expectations"
"and although the young lady and I had long regularly interchanged","Great Expectations"
"messages and remembrances by Herbert, I had never seen her. However, I","Great Expectations"
"did not trouble Wemmick with these particulars.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“The house with the bow-window,” said Wemmick, “being by the","Great Expectations"
"river-side, down the Pool there between Limehouse and Greenwich, and","Great Expectations"
"being kept, it seems, by a very respectable widow who has a furnished","Great Expectations"
"upper floor to let, Mr. Herbert put it to me, what did I think of that","Great Expectations"
"as a temporary tenement for Tom, Jack, or Richard? Now, I thought very","Great Expectations"
"well of it, for three reasons I’ll give you. That is to say: _Firstly_.","Great Expectations"
"It’s altogether out of all your beats, and is well away from the usual","Great Expectations"
"heap of streets great and small. _Secondly_. Without going near it","Great Expectations"
"yourself, you could always hear of the safety of Tom, Jack, or Richard,","Great Expectations"
"through Mr. Herbert. _Thirdly_. After a while and when it might be","Great Expectations"
"prudent, if you should want to slip Tom, Jack, or Richard on board a","Great Expectations"
"foreign packet-boat, there he is—ready.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Much comforted by these considerations, I thanked Wemmick again and","Great Expectations"
"again, and begged him to proceed.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well, sir! Mr. Herbert threw himself into the business with a will,","Great Expectations"
"and by nine o’clock last night he housed Tom, Jack, or","Great Expectations"
"Richard,—whichever it may be,—you and I don’t want to know,—quite","Great Expectations"
"successfully. At the old lodgings it was understood that he was","Great Expectations"
"summoned to Dover, and, in fact, he was taken down the Dover road and","Great Expectations"
"cornered out of it. Now, another great advantage of all this is, that","Great Expectations"
"it was done without you, and when, if any one was concerning himself","Great Expectations"
"about your movements, you must be known to be ever so many miles off","Great Expectations"
"and quite otherwise engaged. This diverts suspicion and confuses it;","Great Expectations"
"and for the same reason I recommended that, even if you came back last","Great Expectations"
"night, you should not go home. It brings in more confusion, and you","Great Expectations"
"want confusion.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Wemmick, having finished his breakfast, here looked at his watch, and","Great Expectations"
"began to get his coat on.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And now, Mr. Pip,” said he, with his hands still in the sleeves, “I","Great Expectations"
"have probably done the most I can do; but if I can ever do more,—from a","Great Expectations"
"Walworth point of view, and in a strictly private and personal","Great Expectations"
"capacity,—I shall be glad to do it. Here’s the address. There can be no","Great Expectations"
"harm in your going here to-night, and seeing for yourself that all is","Great Expectations"
"well with Tom, Jack, or Richard, before you go home,—which is another","Great Expectations"
"reason for your not going home last night. But, after you have gone","Great Expectations"
"home, don’t go back here. You are very welcome, I am sure, Mr. Pip”;","Great Expectations"
"his hands were now out of his sleeves, and I was shaking them; “and let","Great Expectations"
"me finally impress one important point upon you.” He laid his hands","Great Expectations"
"upon my shoulders, and added in a solemn whisper: “Avail yourself of","Great Expectations"
"this evening to lay hold of his portable property. You don’t know what","Great Expectations"
"may happen to him. Don’t let anything happen to the portable property.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Quite despairing of making my mind clear to Wemmick on this point, I","Great Expectations"
"forbore to try.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Time’s up,” said Wemmick, “and I must be off. If you had nothing more","Great Expectations"
"pressing to do than to keep here till dark, that’s what I should","Great Expectations"
"advise. You look very much worried, and it would do you good to have a","Great Expectations"
"perfectly quiet day with the Aged,—he’ll be up presently,—and a little","Great Expectations"
"bit of—you remember the pig?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Of course,” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well; and a little bit of _him_. That sausage you toasted was his, and","Great Expectations"
"he was in all respects a first-rater. Do try him, if it is only for old","Great Expectations"
"acquaintance sake. Good-bye, Aged Parent!” in a cheery shout.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“All right, John; all right, my boy!” piped the old man from within.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I soon fell asleep before Wemmick’s fire, and the Aged and I enjoyed","Great Expectations"
"one another’s society by falling asleep before it more or less all day.","Great Expectations"
"We had loin of pork for dinner, and greens grown on the estate; and I","Great Expectations"
"nodded at the Aged with a good intention whenever I failed to do it","Great Expectations"
"drowsily. When it was quite dark, I left the Aged preparing the fire","Great Expectations"
"for toast; and I inferred from the number of teacups, as well as from","Great Expectations"
"his glances at the two little doors in the wall, that Miss Skiffins was","Great Expectations"
"expected.","Great Expectations"

"Chapter XLVI.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Eight o’clock had struck before I got into the air, that was scented,","Great Expectations"
"not disagreeably, by the chips and shavings of the long-shore","Great Expectations"
"boat-builders, and mast, oar, and block makers. All that water-side","Great Expectations"
"region of the upper and lower Pool below Bridge was unknown ground to","Great Expectations"
"me; and when I struck down by the river, I found that the spot I wanted","Great Expectations"
"was not where I had supposed it to be, and was anything but easy to","Great Expectations"
"find. It was called Mill Pond Bank, Chinks’s Basin; and I had no other","Great Expectations"
"guide to Chinks’s Basin than the Old Green Copper Rope-walk.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It matters not what stranded ships repairing in dry docks I lost myself","Great Expectations"
"among, what old hulls of ships in course of being knocked to pieces,","Great Expectations"
"what ooze and slime and other dregs of tide, what yards of","Great Expectations"
"ship-builders and ship-breakers, what rusty anchors blindly biting into","Great Expectations"
"the ground, though for years off duty, what mountainous country of","Great Expectations"
"accumulated casks and timber, how many rope-walks that were not the Old","Great Expectations"
"Green Copper. After several times falling short of my destination and","Great Expectations"
"as often overshooting it, I came unexpectedly round a corner, upon Mill","Great Expectations"
"Pond Bank. It was a fresh kind of place, all circumstances considered,","Great Expectations"
"where the wind from the river had room to turn itself round; and there","Great Expectations"
"were two or three trees in it, and there was the stump of a ruined","Great Expectations"
"windmill, and there was the Old Green Copper Rope-walk,—whose long and","Great Expectations"
"narrow vista I could trace in the moonlight, along a series of wooden","Great Expectations"
"frames set in the ground, that looked like superannuated","Great Expectations"
"haymaking-rakes which had grown old and lost most of their teeth.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Selecting from the few queer houses upon Mill Pond Bank a house with a","Great Expectations"
"wooden front and three stories of bow-window (not bay-window, which is","Great Expectations"
"another thing), I looked at the plate upon the door, and read there,","Great Expectations"
"Mrs. Whimple. That being the name I wanted, I knocked, and an elderly","Great Expectations"
"woman of a pleasant and thriving appearance responded. She was","Great Expectations"
"immediately deposed, however, by Herbert, who silently led me into the","Great Expectations"
"parlour and shut the door. It was an odd sensation to see his very","Great Expectations"
"familiar face established quite at home in that very unfamiliar room","Great Expectations"
"and region; and I found myself looking at him, much as I looked at the","Great Expectations"
"corner-cupboard with the glass and china, the shells upon the","Great Expectations"
"chimney-piece, and the coloured engravings on the wall, representing","Great Expectations"
"the death of Captain Cook, a ship-launch, and his Majesty King George","Great Expectations"
"the Third in a state coachman’s wig, leather-breeches, and top-boots,","Great Expectations"
"on the terrace at Windsor.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“All is well, Handel,” said Herbert, “and he is quite satisfied, though","Great Expectations"
"eager to see you. My dear girl is with her father; and if you’ll wait","Great Expectations"
"till she comes down, I’ll make you known to her, and then we’ll go","Great Expectations"
"upstairs. _That’s_ her father.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I had become aware of an alarming growling overhead, and had probably","Great Expectations"
"expressed the fact in my countenance.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I am afraid he is a sad old rascal,” said Herbert, smiling, “but I","Great Expectations"
"have never seen him. Don’t you smell rum? He is always at it.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“At rum?” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes,” returned Herbert, “and you may suppose how mild it makes his","Great Expectations"
"gout. He persists, too, in keeping all the provisions upstairs in his","Great Expectations"
"room, and serving them out. He keeps them on shelves over his head, and","Great Expectations"
"_will_ weigh them all. His room must be like a chandler’s shop.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"While he thus spoke, the growling noise became a prolonged roar, and","Great Expectations"
"then died away.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What else can be the consequence,” said Herbert, in explanation, “if","Great Expectations"
"he _will_ cut the cheese? A man with the gout in his right hand—and","Great Expectations"
"everywhere else—can’t expect to get through a Double Gloucester without","Great Expectations"
"hurting himself.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He seemed to have hurt himself very much, for he gave another furious","Great Expectations"
"roar.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“To have Provis for an upper lodger is quite a godsend to Mrs.","Great Expectations"
"Whimple,” said Herbert, “for of course people in general won’t stand","Great Expectations"
"that noise. A curious place, Handel; isn’t it?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was a curious place, indeed; but remarkably well kept and clean.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Mrs. Whimple,” said Herbert, when I told him so, “is the best of","Great Expectations"
"housewives, and I really do not know what my Clara would do without her","Great Expectations"
"motherly help. For, Clara has no mother of her own, Handel, and no","Great Expectations"
"relation in the world but old Gruffandgrim.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Surely that’s not his name, Herbert?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No, no,” said Herbert, “that’s my name for him. His name is Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Barley. But what a blessing it is for the son of my father and mother","Great Expectations"
"to love a girl who has no relations, and who can never bother herself","Great Expectations"
"or anybody else about her family!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Herbert had told me on former occasions, and now reminded me, that he","Great Expectations"
"first knew Miss Clara Barley when she was completing her education at","Great Expectations"
"an establishment at Hammersmith, and that on her being recalled home to","Great Expectations"
"nurse her father, he and she had confided their affection to the","Great Expectations"
"motherly Mrs. Whimple, by whom it had been fostered and regulated with","Great Expectations"
"equal kindness and discretion, ever since. It was understood that","Great Expectations"
"nothing of a tender nature could possibly be confided to old Barley, by","Great Expectations"
"reason of his being totally unequal to the consideration of any subject","Great Expectations"
"more psychological than Gout, Rum, and Purser’s stores.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As we were thus conversing in a low tone while Old Barley’s sustained","Great Expectations"
"growl vibrated in the beam that crossed the ceiling, the room door","Great Expectations"
"opened, and a very pretty, slight, dark-eyed girl of twenty or so came","Great Expectations"
"in with a basket in her hand: whom Herbert tenderly relieved of the","Great Expectations"
"basket, and presented, blushing, as “Clara.” She really was a most","Great Expectations"
"charming girl, and might have passed for a captive fairy, whom that","Great Expectations"
"truculent Ogre, Old Barley, had pressed into his service.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Look here,” said Herbert, showing me the basket, with a compassionate","Great Expectations"
"and tender smile, after we had talked a little; “here’s poor Clara’s","Great Expectations"
"supper, served out every night. Here’s her allowance of bread, and","Great Expectations"
"here’s her slice of cheese, and here’s her rum,—which I drink. This is","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Barley’s breakfast for to-morrow, served out to be cooked. Two","Great Expectations"
"mutton-chops, three potatoes, some split peas, a little flour, two","Great Expectations"
"ounces of butter, a pinch of salt, and all this black pepper. It’s","Great Expectations"
"stewed up together, and taken hot, and it’s a nice thing for the gout,","Great Expectations"
"I should think!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"There was something so natural and winning in Clara’s resigned way of","Great Expectations"
"looking at these stores in detail, as Herbert pointed them out; and","Great Expectations"
"something so confiding, loving, and innocent in her modest manner of","Great Expectations"
"yielding herself to Herbert’s embracing arm; and something so gentle in","Great Expectations"
"her, so much needing protection on Mill Pond Bank, by Chinks’s Basin,","Great Expectations"
"and the Old Green Copper Rope-walk, with Old Barley growling in the","Great Expectations"
"beam,—that I would not have undone the engagement between her and","Great Expectations"
"Herbert for all the money in the pocket-book I had never opened.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I was looking at her with pleasure and admiration, when suddenly the","Great Expectations"
"growl swelled into a roar again, and a frightful bumping noise was","Great Expectations"
"heard above, as if a giant with a wooden leg were trying to bore it","Great Expectations"
"through the ceiling to come at us. Upon this Clara said to Herbert,","Great Expectations"
"“Papa wants me, darling!” and ran away.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“There is an unconscionable old shark for you!” said Herbert. “What do","Great Expectations"
"you suppose he wants now, Handel?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I don’t know,” said I. “Something to drink?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“That’s it!” cried Herbert, as if I had made a guess of extraordinary","Great Expectations"
"merit. “He keeps his grog ready mixed in a little tub on the table.","Great Expectations"
"Wait a moment, and you’ll hear Clara lift him up to take some. There he","Great Expectations"
"goes!” Another roar, with a prolonged shake at the end. “Now,” said","Great Expectations"
"Herbert, as it was succeeded by silence, “he’s drinking. Now,” said","Great Expectations"
"Herbert, as the growl resounded in the beam once more, “he’s down again","Great Expectations"
"on his back!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Clara returned soon afterwards, and Herbert accompanied me upstairs to","Great Expectations"
"see our charge. As we passed Mr. Barley’s door, he was heard hoarsely","Great Expectations"
"muttering within, in a strain that rose and fell like wind, the","Great Expectations"
"following Refrain, in which I substitute good wishes for something","Great Expectations"
"quite the reverse:—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Ahoy! Bless your eyes, here’s old Bill Barley. Here’s old Bill Barley,","Great Expectations"
"bless your eyes. Here’s old Bill Barley on the flat of his back, by the","Great Expectations"
"Lord. Lying on the flat of his back like a drifting old dead flounder,","Great Expectations"
"here’s your old Bill Barley, bless your eyes. Ahoy! Bless you.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"In this strain of consolation, Herbert informed me the invisible Barley","Great Expectations"
"would commune with himself by the day and night together; Often, while","Great Expectations"
"it was light, having, at the same time, one eye at a telescope which","Great Expectations"
"was fitted on his bed for the convenience of sweeping the river.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"In his two cabin rooms at the top of the house, which were fresh and","Great Expectations"
"airy, and in which Mr. Barley was less audible than below, I found","Great Expectations"
"Provis comfortably settled. He expressed no alarm, and seemed to feel","Great Expectations"
"none that was worth mentioning; but it struck me that he was","Great Expectations"
"softened,—indefinably, for I could not have said how, and could never","Great Expectations"
"afterwards recall how when I tried, but certainly.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The opportunity that the day’s rest had given me for reflection had","Great Expectations"
"resulted in my fully determining to say nothing to him respecting","Great Expectations"
"Compeyson. For anything I knew, his animosity towards the man might","Great Expectations"
"otherwise lead to his seeking him out and rushing on his own","Great Expectations"
"destruction. Therefore, when Herbert and I sat down with him by his","Great Expectations"
"fire, I asked him first of all whether he relied on Wemmick’s judgment","Great Expectations"
"and sources of information?","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Ay, ay, dear boy!” he answered, with a grave nod, “Jaggers knows.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Then, I have talked with Wemmick,” said I, “and have come to tell you","Great Expectations"
"what caution he gave me and what advice.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"This I did accurately, with the reservation just mentioned; and I told","Great Expectations"
"him how Wemmick had heard, in Newgate prison (whether from officers or","Great Expectations"
"prisoners I could not say), that he was under some suspicion, and that","Great Expectations"
"my chambers had been watched; how Wemmick had recommended his keeping","Great Expectations"
"close for a time, and my keeping away from him; and what Wemmick had","Great Expectations"
"said about getting him abroad. I added, that of course, when the time","Great Expectations"
"came, I should go with him, or should follow close upon him, as might","Great Expectations"
"be safest in Wemmick’s judgment. What was to follow that I did not","Great Expectations"
"touch upon; neither, indeed, was I at all clear or comfortable about it","Great Expectations"
"in my own mind, now that I saw him in that softer condition, and in","Great Expectations"
"declared peril for my sake. As to altering my way of living by","Great Expectations"
"enlarging my expenses, I put it to him whether in our present unsettled","Great Expectations"
"and difficult circumstances, it would not be simply ridiculous, if it","Great Expectations"
"were no worse?","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He could not deny this, and indeed was very reasonable throughout. His","Great Expectations"
"coming back was a venture, he said, and he had always known it to be a","Great Expectations"
"venture. He would do nothing to make it a desperate venture, and he had","Great Expectations"
"very little fear of his safety with such good help.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Herbert, who had been looking at the fire and pondering, here said that","Great Expectations"
"something had come into his thoughts arising out of Wemmick’s","Great Expectations"
"suggestion, which it might be worth while to pursue. “We are both good","Great Expectations"
"watermen, Handel, and could take him down the river ourselves when the","Great Expectations"
"right time comes. No boat would then be hired for the purpose, and no","Great Expectations"
"boatmen; that would save at least a chance of suspicion, and any chance","Great Expectations"
"is worth saving. Never mind the season; don’t you think it might be a","Great Expectations"
"good thing if you began at once to keep a boat at the Temple stairs,","Great Expectations"
"and were in the habit of rowing up and down the river? You fall into","Great Expectations"
"that habit, and then who notices or minds? Do it twenty or fifty times,","Great Expectations"
"and there is nothing special in your doing it the twenty-first or","Great Expectations"
"fifty-first.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I liked this scheme, and Provis was quite elated by it. We agreed that","Great Expectations"
"it should be carried into execution, and that Provis should never","Great Expectations"
"recognise us if we came below Bridge, and rowed past Mill Pond Bank.","Great Expectations"
"But we further agreed that he should pull down the blind in that part","Great Expectations"
"of his window which gave upon the east, whenever he saw us and all was","Great Expectations"
"right.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Our conference being now ended, and everything arranged, I rose to go;","Great Expectations"
"remarking to Herbert that he and I had better not go home together, and","Great Expectations"
"that I would take half an hour’s start of him. “I don’t like to leave","Great Expectations"
"you here,” I said to Provis, “though I cannot doubt your being safer","Great Expectations"
"here than near me. Good-bye!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Dear boy,” he answered, clasping my hands, “I don’t know when we may","Great Expectations"
"meet again, and I don’t like good-bye. Say good-night!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Good-night! Herbert will go regularly between us, and when the time","Great Expectations"
"comes you may be certain I shall be ready. Good-night, good-night!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We thought it best that he should stay in his own rooms; and we left","Great Expectations"
"him on the landing outside his door, holding a light over the","Great Expectations"
"stair-rail to light us downstairs. Looking back at him, I thought of","Great Expectations"
"the first night of his return, when our positions were reversed, and","Great Expectations"
"when I little supposed my heart could ever be as heavy and anxious at","Great Expectations"
"parting from him as it was now.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Old Barley was growling and swearing when we repassed his door, with no","Great Expectations"
"appearance of having ceased or of meaning to cease. When we got to the","Great Expectations"
"foot of the stairs, I asked Herbert whether he had preserved the name","Great Expectations"
"of Provis. He replied, certainly not, and that the lodger was Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Campbell. He also explained that the utmost known of Mr. Campbell there","Great Expectations"
"was, that he (Herbert) had Mr. Campbell consigned to him, and felt a","Great Expectations"
"strong personal interest in his being well cared for, and living a","Great Expectations"
"secluded life. So, when we went into the parlour where Mrs. Whimple and","Great Expectations"
"Clara were seated at work, I said nothing of my own interest in Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Campbell, but kept it to myself.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"When I had taken leave of the pretty, gentle, dark-eyed girl, and of","Great Expectations"
"the motherly woman who had not outlived her honest sympathy with a","Great Expectations"
"little affair of true love, I felt as if the Old Green Copper Rope-walk","Great Expectations"
"had grown quite a different place. Old Barley might be as old as the","Great Expectations"
"hills, and might swear like a whole field of troopers, but there were","Great Expectations"
"redeeming youth and trust and hope enough in Chinks’s Basin to fill it","Great Expectations"
"to overflowing. And then I thought of Estella, and of our parting, and","Great Expectations"
"went home very sadly.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"All things were as quiet in the Temple as ever I had seen them. The","Great Expectations"
"windows of the rooms on that side, lately occupied by Provis, were dark","Great Expectations"
"and still, and there was no lounger in Garden Court. I walked past the","Great Expectations"
"fountain twice or thrice before I descended the steps that were between","Great Expectations"
"me and my rooms, but I was quite alone. Herbert, coming to my bedside","Great Expectations"
"when he came in,—for I went straight to bed, dispirited and","Great Expectations"
"fatigued,—made the same report. Opening one of the windows after that,","Great Expectations"
"he looked out into the moonlight, and told me that the pavement was as","Great Expectations"
"solemnly empty as the pavement of any cathedral at that same hour.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Next day I set myself to get the boat. It was soon done, and the boat","Great Expectations"
"was brought round to the Temple stairs, and lay where I could reach her","Great Expectations"
"within a minute or two. Then, I began to go out as for training and","Great Expectations"
"practice: sometimes alone, sometimes with Herbert. I was often out in","Great Expectations"
"cold, rain, and sleet, but nobody took much note of me after I had been","Great Expectations"
"out a few times. At first, I kept above Blackfriars Bridge; but as the","Great Expectations"
"hours of the tide changed, I took towards London Bridge. It was Old","Great Expectations"
"London Bridge in those days, and at certain states of the tide there","Great Expectations"
"was a race and fall of water there which gave it a bad reputation. But","Great Expectations"
"I knew well enough how to ‘shoot’ the bridge after seeing it done, and","Great Expectations"
"so began to row about among the shipping in the Pool, and down to","Great Expectations"
"Erith. The first time I passed Mill Pond Bank, Herbert and I were","Great Expectations"
"pulling a pair of oars; and, both in going and returning, we saw the","Great Expectations"
"blind towards the east come down. Herbert was rarely there less","Great Expectations"
"frequently than three times in a week, and he never brought me a single","Great Expectations"
"word of intelligence that was at all alarming. Still, I knew that there","Great Expectations"
"was cause for alarm, and I could not get rid of the notion of being","Great Expectations"
"watched. Once received, it is a haunting idea; how many undesigning","Great Expectations"
"persons I suspected of watching me, it would be hard to calculate.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"In short, I was always full of fears for the rash man who was in","Great Expectations"
"hiding. Herbert had sometimes said to me that he found it pleasant to","Great Expectations"
"stand at one of our windows after dark, when the tide was running down,","Great Expectations"
"and to think that it was flowing, with everything it bore, towards","Great Expectations"
"Clara. But I thought with dread that it was flowing towards Magwitch,","Great Expectations"
"and that any black mark on its surface might be his pursuers, going","Great Expectations"
"swiftly, silently, and surely, to take him.","Great Expectations"

"Chapter XLVII.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Some weeks passed without bringing any change. We waited for Wemmick,","Great Expectations"
"and he made no sign. If I had never known him out of Little Britain,","Great Expectations"
"and had never enjoyed the privilege of being on a familiar footing at","Great Expectations"
"the Castle, I might have doubted him; not so for a moment, knowing him","Great Expectations"
"as I did.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"My worldly affairs began to wear a gloomy appearance, and I was pressed","Great Expectations"
"for money by more than one creditor. Even I myself began to know the","Great Expectations"
"want of money (I mean of ready money in my own pocket), and to relieve","Great Expectations"
"it by converting some easily spared articles of jewelery into cash. But","Great Expectations"
"I had quite determined that it would be a heartless fraud to take more","Great Expectations"
"money from my patron in the existing state of my uncertain thoughts and","Great Expectations"
"plans. Therefore, I had sent him the unopened pocket-book by Herbert,","Great Expectations"
"to hold in his own keeping, and I felt a kind of satisfaction—whether","Great Expectations"
"it was a false kind or a true, I hardly know—in not having profited by","Great Expectations"
"his generosity since his revelation of himself.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As the time wore on, an impression settled heavily upon me that Estella","Great Expectations"
"was married. Fearful of having it confirmed, though it was all but a","Great Expectations"
"conviction, I avoided the newspapers, and begged Herbert (to whom I had","Great Expectations"
"confided the circumstances of our last interview) never to speak of her","Great Expectations"
"to me. Why I hoarded up this last wretched little rag of the robe of","Great Expectations"
"hope that was rent and given to the winds, how do I know? Why did you","Great Expectations"
"who read this, commit that not dissimilar inconsistency of your own","Great Expectations"
"last year, last month, last week?","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was an unhappy life that I lived; and its one dominant anxiety,","Great Expectations"
"towering over all its other anxieties, like a high mountain above a","Great Expectations"
"range of mountains, never disappeared from my view. Still, no new cause","Great Expectations"
"for fear arose. Let me start from my bed as I would, with the terror","Great Expectations"
"fresh upon me that he was discovered; let me sit listening, as I would","Great Expectations"
"with dread, for Herbert’s returning step at night, lest it should be","Great Expectations"
"fleeter than ordinary, and winged with evil news,—for all that, and","Great Expectations"
"much more to like purpose, the round of things went on. Condemned to","Great Expectations"
"inaction and a state of constant restlessness and suspense, I rowed","Great Expectations"
"about in my boat, and waited, waited, waited, as I best could.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"There were states of the tide when, having been down the river, I could","Great Expectations"
"not get back through the eddy-chafed arches and starlings of old London","Great Expectations"
"Bridge; then, I left my boat at a wharf near the Custom House, to be","Great Expectations"
"brought up afterwards to the Temple stairs. I was not averse to doing","Great Expectations"
"this, as it served to make me and my boat a commoner incident among the","Great Expectations"
"water-side people there. From this slight occasion sprang two meetings","Great Expectations"
"that I have now to tell of.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"One afternoon, late in the month of February, I came ashore at the","Great Expectations"
"wharf at dusk. I had pulled down as far as Greenwich with the ebb tide,","Great Expectations"
"and had turned with the tide. It had been a fine bright day, but had","Great Expectations"
"become foggy as the sun dropped, and I had had to feel my way back","Great Expectations"
"among the shipping, pretty carefully. Both in going and returning, I","Great Expectations"
"had seen the signal in his window, All well.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As it was a raw evening, and I was cold, I thought I would comfort","Great Expectations"
"myself with dinner at once; and as I had hours of dejection and","Great Expectations"
"solitude before me if I went home to the Temple, I thought I would","Great Expectations"
"afterwards go to the play. The theatre where Mr. Wopsle had achieved","Great Expectations"
"his questionable triumph was in that water-side neighbourhood (it is","Great Expectations"
"nowhere now), and to that theatre I resolved to go. I was aware that","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Wopsle had not succeeded in reviving the Drama, but, on the","Great Expectations"
"contrary, had rather partaken of its decline. He had been ominously","Great Expectations"
"heard of, through the play-bills, as a faithful Black, in connection","Great Expectations"
"with a little girl of noble birth, and a monkey. And Herbert had seen","Great Expectations"
"him as a predatory Tartar of comic propensities, with a face like a red","Great Expectations"
"brick, and an outrageous hat all over bells.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I dined at what Herbert and I used to call a geographical chop-house,","Great Expectations"
"where there were maps of the world in porter-pot rims on every","Great Expectations"
"half-yard of the tablecloths, and charts of gravy on every one of the","Great Expectations"
"knives,—to this day there is scarcely a single chop-house within the","Great Expectations"
"Lord Mayor’s dominions which is not geographical,—and wore out the time","Great Expectations"
"in dozing over crumbs, staring at gas, and baking in a hot blast of","Great Expectations"
"dinners. By and by, I roused myself, and went to the play.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"There, I found a virtuous boatswain in His Majesty’s service,—a most","Great Expectations"
"excellent man, though I could have wished his trousers not quite so","Great Expectations"
"tight in some places, and not quite so loose in others,—who knocked all","Great Expectations"
"the little men’s hats over their eyes, though he was very generous and","Great Expectations"
"brave, and who wouldn’t hear of anybody’s paying taxes, though he was","Great Expectations"
"very patriotic. He had a bag of money in his pocket, like a pudding in","Great Expectations"
"the cloth, and on that property married a young person in","Great Expectations"
"bed-furniture, with great rejoicings; the whole population of","Great Expectations"
"Portsmouth (nine in number at the last census) turning out on the beach","Great Expectations"
"to rub their own hands and shake everybody else’s, and sing “Fill,","Great Expectations"
"fill!” A certain dark-complexioned Swab, however, who wouldn’t fill, or","Great Expectations"
"do anything else that was proposed to him, and whose heart was openly","Great Expectations"
"stated (by the boatswain) to be as black as his figure-head, proposed","Great Expectations"
"to two other Swabs to get all mankind into difficulties; which was so","Great Expectations"
"effectually done (the Swab family having considerable political","Great Expectations"
"influence) that it took half the evening to set things right, and then","Great Expectations"
"it was only brought about through an honest little grocer with a white","Great Expectations"
"hat, black gaiters, and red nose, getting into a clock, with a","Great Expectations"
"gridiron, and listening, and coming out, and knocking everybody down","Great Expectations"
"from behind with the gridiron whom he couldn’t confute with what he had","Great Expectations"
"overheard. This led to Mr. Wopsle’s (who had never been heard of","Great Expectations"
"before) coming in with a star and garter on, as a plenipotentiary of","Great Expectations"
"great power direct from the Admiralty, to say that the Swabs were all","Great Expectations"
"to go to prison on the spot, and that he had brought the boatswain down","Great Expectations"
"the Union Jack, as a slight acknowledgment of his public services. The","Great Expectations"
"boatswain, unmanned for the first time, respectfully dried his eyes on","Great Expectations"
"the Jack, and then cheering up, and addressing Mr. Wopsle as Your","Great Expectations"
"Honour, solicited permission to take him by the fin. Mr. Wopsle,","Great Expectations"
"conceding his fin with a gracious dignity, was immediately shoved into","Great Expectations"
"a dusty corner, while everybody danced a hornpipe; and from that","Great Expectations"
"corner, surveying the public with a discontented eye, became aware of","Great Expectations"
"me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The second piece was the last new grand comic Christmas pantomime, in","Great Expectations"
"the first scene of which, it pained me to suspect that I detected Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Wopsle with red worsted legs under a highly magnified phosphoric","Great Expectations"
"countenance and a shock of red curtain-fringe for his hair, engaged in","Great Expectations"
"the manufacture of thunderbolts in a mine, and displaying great","Great Expectations"
"cowardice when his gigantic master came home (very hoarse) to dinner.","Great Expectations"
"But he presently presented himself under worthier circumstances; for,","Great Expectations"
"the Genius of Youthful Love being in want of assistance,—on account of","Great Expectations"
"the parental brutality of an ignorant farmer who opposed the choice of","Great Expectations"
"his daughter’s heart, by purposely falling upon the object, in a","Great Expectations"
"flour-sack, out of the first-floor window,—summoned a sententious","Great Expectations"
"Enchanter; and he, coming up from the antipodes rather unsteadily,","Great Expectations"
"after an apparently violent journey, proved to be Mr. Wopsle in a","Great Expectations"
"high-crowned hat, with a necromantic work in one volume under his arm.","Great Expectations"
"The business of this enchanter on earth being principally to be talked","Great Expectations"
"at, sung at, butted at, danced at, and flashed at with fires of various","Great Expectations"
"colours, he had a good deal of time on his hands. And I observed, with","Great Expectations"
"great surprise, that he devoted it to staring in my direction as if he","Great Expectations"
"were lost in amazement.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"There was something so remarkable in the increasing glare of Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Wopsle’s eye, and he seemed to be turning so many things over in his","Great Expectations"
"mind and to grow so confused, that I could not make it out. I sat","Great Expectations"
"thinking of it long after he had ascended to the clouds in a large","Great Expectations"
"watch-case, and still I could not make it out. I was still thinking of","Great Expectations"
"it when I came out of the theatre an hour afterwards, and found him","Great Expectations"
"waiting for me near the door.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“How do you do?” said I, shaking hands with him as we turned down the","Great Expectations"
"street together. “I saw that you saw me.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Saw you, Mr. Pip!” he returned. “Yes, of course I saw you. But who","Great Expectations"
"else was there?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Who else?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It is the strangest thing,” said Mr. Wopsle, drifting into his lost","Great Expectations"
"look again; “and yet I could swear to him.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Becoming alarmed, I entreated Mr. Wopsle to explain his meaning.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Whether I should have noticed him at first but for your being there,”","Great Expectations"
"said Mr. Wopsle, going on in the same lost way, “I can’t be positive;","Great Expectations"
"yet I think I should.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Involuntarily I looked round me, as I was accustomed to look round me","Great Expectations"
"when I went home; for these mysterious words gave me a chill.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Oh! He can’t be in sight,” said Mr. Wopsle. “He went out before I went","Great Expectations"
"off. I saw him go.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Having the reason that I had for being suspicious, I even suspected","Great Expectations"
"this poor actor. I mistrusted a design to entrap me into some","Great Expectations"
"admission. Therefore I glanced at him as we walked on together, but","Great Expectations"
"said nothing.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I had a ridiculous fancy that he must be with you, Mr. Pip, till I saw","Great Expectations"
"that you were quite unconscious of him, sitting behind you there like a","Great Expectations"
"ghost.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"My former chill crept over me again, but I was resolved not to speak","Great Expectations"
"yet, for it was quite consistent with his words that he might be set on","Great Expectations"
"to induce me to connect these references with Provis. Of course, I was","Great Expectations"
"perfectly sure and safe that Provis had not been there.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I dare say you wonder at me, Mr. Pip; indeed, I see you do. But it is","Great Expectations"
"so very strange! You’ll hardly believe what I am going to tell you. I","Great Expectations"
"could hardly believe it myself, if you told me.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Indeed?” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No, indeed. Mr. Pip, you remember in old times a certain Christmas","Great Expectations"
"Day, when you were quite a child, and I dined at Gargery’s, and some","Great Expectations"
"soldiers came to the door to get a pair of handcuffs mended?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I remember it very well.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And you remember that there was a chase after two convicts, and that","Great Expectations"
"we joined in it, and that Gargery took you on his back, and that I took","Great Expectations"
"the lead, and you kept up with me as well as you could?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I remember it all very well.” Better than he thought,—except the last","Great Expectations"
"clause.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And you remember that we came up with the two in a ditch, and that","Great Expectations"
"there was a scuffle between them, and that one of them had been","Great Expectations"
"severely handled and much mauled about the face by the other?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I see it all before me.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And that the soldiers lighted torches, and put the two in the centre,","Great Expectations"
"and that we went on to see the last of them, over the black marshes,","Great Expectations"
"with the torchlight shining on their faces,—I am particular about","Great Expectations"
"that,—with the torchlight shining on their faces, when there was an","Great Expectations"
"outer ring of dark night all about us?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes,” said I. “I remember all that.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Then, Mr. Pip, one of those two prisoners sat behind you tonight. I","Great Expectations"
"saw him over your shoulder.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Steady!” I thought. I asked him then, “Which of the two do you suppose","Great Expectations"
"you saw?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“The one who had been mauled,” he answered readily, “and I’ll swear I","Great Expectations"
"saw him! The more I think of him, the more certain I am of him.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“This is very curious!” said I, with the best assumption I could put on","Great Expectations"
"of its being nothing more to me. “Very curious indeed!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I cannot exaggerate the enhanced disquiet into which this conversation","Great Expectations"
"threw me, or the special and peculiar terror I felt at Compeyson’s","Great Expectations"
"having been behind me “like a ghost.” For if he had ever been out of my","Great Expectations"
"thoughts for a few moments together since the hiding had begun, it was","Great Expectations"
"in those very moments when he was closest to me; and to think that I","Great Expectations"
"should be so unconscious and off my guard after all my care was as if I","Great Expectations"
"had shut an avenue of a hundred doors to keep him out, and then had","Great Expectations"
"found him at my elbow. I could not doubt, either, that he was there,","Great Expectations"
"because I was there, and that, however slight an appearance of danger","Great Expectations"
"there might be about us, danger was always near and active.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I put such questions to Mr. Wopsle as, When did the man come in? He","Great Expectations"
"could not tell me that; he saw me, and over my shoulder he saw the man.","Great Expectations"
"It was not until he had seen him for some time that he began to","Great Expectations"
"identify him; but he had from the first vaguely associated him with me,","Great Expectations"
"and known him as somehow belonging to me in the old village time. How","Great Expectations"
"was he dressed? Prosperously, but not noticeably otherwise; he thought,","Great Expectations"
"in black. Was his face at all disfigured? No, he believed not. I","Great Expectations"
"believed not too, for, although in my brooding state I had taken no","Great Expectations"
"especial notice of the people behind me, I thought it likely that a","Great Expectations"
"face at all disfigured would have attracted my attention.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"When Mr. Wopsle had imparted to me all that he could recall or I","Great Expectations"
"extract, and when I had treated him to a little appropriate","Great Expectations"
"refreshment, after the fatigues of the evening, we parted. It was","Great Expectations"
"between twelve and one o’clock when I reached the Temple, and the gates","Great Expectations"
"were shut. No one was near me when I went in and went home.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Herbert had come in, and we held a very serious council by the fire.","Great Expectations"
"But there was nothing to be done, saving to communicate to Wemmick what","Great Expectations"
"I had that night found out, and to remind him that we waited for his","Great Expectations"
"hint. As I thought that I might compromise him if I went too often to","Great Expectations"
"the Castle, I made this communication by letter. I wrote it before I","Great Expectations"
"went to bed, and went out and posted it; and again no one was near me.","Great Expectations"
"Herbert and I agreed that we could do nothing else but be very","Great Expectations"
"cautious. And we were very cautious indeed,—more cautious than before,","Great Expectations"
"if that were possible,—and I for my part never went near Chinks’s","Great Expectations"
"Basin, except when I rowed by, and then I only looked at Mill Pond Bank","Great Expectations"
"as I looked at anything else.","Great Expectations"

"Chapter XLVIII.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The second of the two meetings referred to in the last chapter occurred","Great Expectations"
"about a week after the first. I had again left my boat at the wharf","Great Expectations"
"below Bridge; the time was an hour earlier in the afternoon; and,","Great Expectations"
"undecided where to dine, I had strolled up into Cheapside, and was","Great Expectations"
"strolling along it, surely the most unsettled person in all the busy","Great Expectations"
"concourse, when a large hand was laid upon my shoulder by some one","Great Expectations"
"overtaking me. It was Mr. Jaggers’s hand, and he passed it through my","Great Expectations"
"arm.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“As we are going in the same direction, Pip, we may walk together.","Great Expectations"
"Where are you bound for?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“For the Temple, I think,” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Don’t you know?” said Mr. Jaggers.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well,” I returned, glad for once to get the better of him in","Great Expectations"

"","Great Expectations"
"“You are going to dine?” said Mr. Jaggers. “You don’t mind admitting","Great Expectations"
"that, I suppose?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No,” I returned, “I don’t mind admitting that.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And are not engaged?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I don’t mind admitting also that I am not engaged.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Then,” said Mr. Jaggers, “come and dine with me.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I was going to excuse myself, when he added, “Wemmick’s coming.” So I","Great Expectations"
"changed my excuse into an acceptance,—the few words I had uttered,","Great Expectations"
"serving for the beginning of either,—and we went along Cheapside and","Great Expectations"
"slanted off to Little Britain, while the lights were springing up","Great Expectations"
"brilliantly in the shop windows, and the street lamp-lighters, scarcely","Great Expectations"
"finding ground enough to plant their ladders on in the midst of the","Great Expectations"
"afternoon’s bustle, were skipping up and down and running in and out,","Great Expectations"
"opening more red eyes in the gathering fog than my rushlight tower at","Great Expectations"
"the Hummums had opened white eyes in the ghostly wall.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"At the office in Little Britain there was the usual letter-writing,","Great Expectations"
"hand-washing, candle-snuffing, and safe-locking, that closed the","Great Expectations"
"business of the day. As I stood idle by Mr. Jaggers’s fire, its rising","Great Expectations"
"and falling flame made the two casts on the shelf look as if they were","Great Expectations"
"playing a diabolical game at bo-peep with me; while the pair of coarse,","Great Expectations"
"fat office candles that dimly lighted Mr. Jaggers as he wrote in a","Great Expectations"
"corner were decorated with dirty winding-sheets, as if in remembrance","Great Expectations"
"of a host of hanged clients.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We went to Gerrard Street, all three together, in a hackney-coach: And,","Great Expectations"
"as soon as we got there, dinner was served. Although I should not have","Great Expectations"
"thought of making, in that place, the most distant reference by so much","Great Expectations"
"as a look to Wemmick’s Walworth sentiments, yet I should have had no","Great Expectations"
"objection to catching his eye now and then in a friendly way. But it","Great Expectations"
"was not to be done. He turned his eyes on Mr. Jaggers whenever he","Great Expectations"
"raised them from the table, and was as dry and distant to me as if","Great Expectations"
"there were twin Wemmicks, and this was the wrong one.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Did you send that note of Miss Havisham’s to Mr. Pip, Wemmick?” Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Jaggers asked, soon after we began dinner.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No, sir,” returned Wemmick; “it was going by post, when you brought","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Pip into the office. Here it is.” He handed it to his principal","Great Expectations"
"instead of to me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It’s a note of two lines, Pip,” said Mr. Jaggers, handing it on, “sent","Great Expectations"
"up to me by Miss Havisham on account of her not being sure of your","Great Expectations"
"address. She tells me that she wants to see you on a little matter of","Great Expectations"
"business you mentioned to her. You’ll go down?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes,” said I, casting my eyes over the note, which was exactly in","Great Expectations"
"those terms.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“When do you think of going down?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I have an impending engagement,” said I, glancing at Wemmick, who was","Great Expectations"
"putting fish into the post-office, “that renders me rather uncertain of","Great Expectations"
"my time. At once, I think.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“If Mr. Pip has the intention of going at once,” said Wemmick to Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Jaggers, “he needn’t write an answer, you know.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Receiving this as an intimation that it was best not to delay, I","Great Expectations"
"settled that I would go to-morrow, and said so. Wemmick drank a glass","Great Expectations"
"of wine, and looked with a grimly satisfied air at Mr. Jaggers, but not","Great Expectations"
"at me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“So, Pip! Our friend the Spider,” said Mr. Jaggers, “has played his","Great Expectations"
"cards. He has won the pool.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was as much as I could do to assent.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Hah! He is a promising fellow—in his way—but he may not have it all","Great Expectations"
"his own way. The stronger will win in the end, but the stronger has to","Great Expectations"
"be found out first. If he should turn to, and beat her—”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Surely,” I interrupted, with a burning face and heart, “you do not","Great Expectations"
"seriously think that he is scoundrel enough for that, Mr. Jaggers?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I didn’t say so, Pip. I am putting a case. If he should turn to and","Great Expectations"
"beat her, he may possibly get the strength on his side; if it should be","Great Expectations"
"a question of intellect, he certainly will not. It would be chance work","Great Expectations"
"to give an opinion how a fellow of that sort will turn out in such","Great Expectations"
"circumstances, because it’s a toss-up between two results.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“May I ask what they are?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“A fellow like our friend the Spider,” answered Mr. Jaggers, “either","Great Expectations"
"beats or cringes. He may cringe and growl, or cringe and not growl; but","Great Expectations"
"he either beats or cringes. Ask Wemmick _his_ opinion.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Either beats or cringes,” said Wemmick, not at all addressing himself","Great Expectations"
"to me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“So here’s to Mrs. Bentley Drummle,” said Mr. Jaggers, taking a","Great Expectations"
"decanter of choicer wine from his dumb-waiter, and filling for each of","Great Expectations"
"us and for himself, “and may the question of supremacy be settled to","Great Expectations"
"the lady’s satisfaction! To the satisfaction of the lady _and_ the","Great Expectations"
"gentleman, it never will be. Now, Molly, Molly, Molly, Molly, how slow","Great Expectations"
"you are to-day!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"She was at his elbow when he addressed her, putting a dish upon the","Great Expectations"
"table. As she withdrew her hands from it, she fell back a step or two,","Great Expectations"
"nervously muttering some excuse. And a certain action of her fingers,","Great Expectations"
"as she spoke, arrested my attention.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What’s the matter?” said Mr. Jaggers.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Nothing. Only the subject we were speaking of,” said I, “was rather","Great Expectations"
"painful to me.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The action of her fingers was like the action of knitting. She stood","Great Expectations"
"looking at her master, not understanding whether she was free to go, or","Great Expectations"
"whether he had more to say to her and would call her back if she did","Great Expectations"
"go. Her look was very intent. Surely, I had seen exactly such eyes and","Great Expectations"
"such hands on a memorable occasion very lately!","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He dismissed her, and she glided out of the room. But she remained","Great Expectations"
"before me as plainly as if she were still there. I looked at those","Great Expectations"
"hands, I looked at those eyes, I looked at that flowing hair; and I","Great Expectations"
"compared them with other hands, other eyes, other hair, that I knew of,","Great Expectations"
"and with what those might be after twenty years of a brutal husband and","Great Expectations"
"a stormy life. I looked again at those hands and eyes of the","Great Expectations"
"housekeeper, and thought of the inexplicable feeling that had come over","Great Expectations"
"me when I last walked—not alone—in the ruined garden, and through the","Great Expectations"
"deserted brewery. I thought how the same feeling had come back when I","Great Expectations"
"saw a face looking at me, and a hand waving to me from a stage-coach","Great Expectations"
"window; and how it had come back again and had flashed about me like","Great Expectations"
"lightning, when I had passed in a carriage—not alone—through a sudden","Great Expectations"
"glare of light in a dark street. I thought how one link of association","Great Expectations"
"had helped that identification in the theatre, and how such a link,","Great Expectations"
"wanting before, had been riveted for me now, when I had passed by a","Great Expectations"
"chance swift from Estella’s name to the fingers with their knitting","Great Expectations"
"action, and the attentive eyes. And I felt absolutely certain that this","Great Expectations"
"woman was Estella’s mother.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Jaggers had seen me with Estella, and was not likely to have missed","Great Expectations"
"the sentiments I had been at no pains to conceal. He nodded when I said","Great Expectations"
"the subject was painful to me, clapped me on the back, put round the","Great Expectations"
"wine again, and went on with his dinner.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Only twice more did the housekeeper reappear, and then her stay in the","Great Expectations"
"room was very short, and Mr. Jaggers was sharp with her. But her hands","Great Expectations"
"were Estella’s hands, and her eyes were Estella’s eyes, and if she had","Great Expectations"
"reappeared a hundred times I could have been neither more sure nor less","Great Expectations"
"sure that my conviction was the truth.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was a dull evening, for Wemmick drew his wine, when it came round,","Great Expectations"
"quite as a matter of business,—just as he might have drawn his salary","Great Expectations"
"when that came round,—and with his eyes on his chief, sat in a state of","Great Expectations"
"perpetual readiness for cross-examination. As to the quantity of wine,","Great Expectations"
"his post-office was as indifferent and ready as any other post-office","Great Expectations"
"for its quantity of letters. From my point of view, he was the wrong","Great Expectations"
"twin all the time, and only externally like the Wemmick of Walworth.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We took our leave early, and left together. Even when we were groping","Great Expectations"
"among Mr. Jaggers’s stock of boots for our hats, I felt that the right","Great Expectations"
"twin was on his way back; and we had not gone half a dozen yards down","Great Expectations"
"Gerrard Street in the Walworth direction, before I found that I was","Great Expectations"
"walking arm in arm with the right twin, and that the wrong twin had","Great Expectations"
"evaporated into the evening air.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well!” said Wemmick, “that’s over! He’s a wonderful man, without his","Great Expectations"
"living likeness; but I feel that I have to screw myself up when I dine","Great Expectations"
"with him,—and I dine more comfortably unscrewed.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I felt that this was a good statement of the case, and told him so.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Wouldn’t say it to anybody but yourself,” he answered. “I know that","Great Expectations"
"what is said between you and me goes no further.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I asked him if he had ever seen Miss Havisham’s adopted daughter, Mrs.","Great Expectations"
"Bentley Drummle. He said no. To avoid being too abrupt, I then spoke of","Great Expectations"
"the Aged and of Miss Skiffins. He looked rather sly when I mentioned","Great Expectations"
"Miss Skiffins, and stopped in the street to blow his nose, with a roll","Great Expectations"
"of the head, and a flourish not quite free from latent boastfulness.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Wemmick,” said I, “do you remember telling me, before I first went to","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Jaggers’s private house, to notice that housekeeper?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Did I?” he replied. “Ah, I dare say I did. Deuce take me,” he added,","Great Expectations"
"suddenly, “I know I did. I find I am not quite unscrewed yet.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“A wild beast tamed, you called her.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And what do _you_ call her?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“The same. How did Mr. Jaggers tame her, Wemmick?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“That’s his secret. She has been with him many a long year.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I wish you would tell me her story. I feel a particular interest in","Great Expectations"
"being acquainted with it. You know that what is said between you and me","Great Expectations"
"goes no further.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well!” Wemmick replied, “I don’t know her story,—that is, I don’t know","Great Expectations"
"all of it. But what I do know I’ll tell you. We are in our private and","Great Expectations"
"personal capacities, of course.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Of course.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“A score or so of years ago, that woman was tried at the Old Bailey for","Great Expectations"
"murder, and was acquitted. She was a very handsome young woman, and I","Great Expectations"
"believe had some gypsy blood in her. Anyhow, it was hot enough when it","Great Expectations"
"was up, as you may suppose.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“But she was acquitted.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Mr. Jaggers was for her,” pursued Wemmick, with a look full of","Great Expectations"
"meaning, “and worked the case in a way quite astonishing. It was a","Great Expectations"
"desperate case, and it was comparatively early days with him then, and","Great Expectations"
"he worked it to general admiration; in fact, it may almost be said to","Great Expectations"
"have made him. He worked it himself at the police-office, day after day","Great Expectations"
"for many days, contending against even a committal; and at the trial","Great Expectations"
"where he couldn’t work it himself, sat under counsel, and—every one","Great Expectations"
"knew—put in all the salt and pepper. The murdered person was a woman,—a","Great Expectations"
"woman a good ten years older, very much larger, and very much stronger.","Great Expectations"
"It was a case of jealousy. They both led tramping lives, and this woman","Great Expectations"
"in Gerrard Street here had been married very young, over the broomstick","Great Expectations"
"(as we say), to a tramping man, and was a perfect fury in point of","Great Expectations"
"jealousy. The murdered woman,—more a match for the man, certainly, in","Great Expectations"
"point of years—was found dead in a barn near Hounslow Heath. There had","Great Expectations"
"been a violent struggle, perhaps a fight. She was bruised and scratched","Great Expectations"
"and torn, and had been held by the throat, at last, and choked. Now,","Great Expectations"
"there was no reasonable evidence to implicate any person but this","Great Expectations"
"woman, and on the improbabilities of her having been able to do it Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Jaggers principally rested his case. You may be sure,” said Wemmick,","Great Expectations"
"touching me on the sleeve, “that he never dwelt upon the strength of","Great Expectations"
"her hands then, though he sometimes does now.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I had told Wemmick of his showing us her wrists, that day of the dinner","Great Expectations"
"party.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well, sir!” Wemmick went on; “it happened—happened, don’t you","Great Expectations"
"see?—that this woman was so very artfully dressed from the time of her","Great Expectations"
"apprehension, that she looked much slighter than she really was; in","Great Expectations"
"particular, her sleeves are always remembered to have been so skilfully","Great Expectations"
"contrived that her arms had quite a delicate look. She had only a","Great Expectations"
"bruise or two about her,—nothing for a tramp,—but the backs of her","Great Expectations"
"hands were lacerated, and the question was, Was it with finger-nails?","Great Expectations"
"Now, Mr. Jaggers showed that she had struggled through a great lot of","Great Expectations"
"brambles which were not as high as her face; but which she could not","Great Expectations"
"have got through and kept her hands out of; and bits of those brambles","Great Expectations"
"were actually found in her skin and put in evidence, as well as the","Great Expectations"
"fact that the brambles in question were found on examination to have","Great Expectations"
"been broken through, and to have little shreds of her dress and little","Great Expectations"
"spots of blood upon them here and there. But the boldest point he made","Great Expectations"
"was this: it was attempted to be set up, in proof of her jealousy, that","Great Expectations"
"she was under strong suspicion of having, at about the time of the","Great Expectations"
"murder, frantically destroyed her child by this man—some three years","Great Expectations"
"old—to revenge herself upon him. Mr. Jaggers worked that in this way:","Great Expectations"
"“We say these are not marks of finger-nails, but marks of brambles, and","Great Expectations"
"we show you the brambles. You say they are marks of finger-nails, and","Great Expectations"
"you set up the hypothesis that she destroyed her child. You must accept","Great Expectations"
"all consequences of that hypothesis. For anything we know, she may have","Great Expectations"
"destroyed her child, and the child in clinging to her may have","Great Expectations"
"scratched her hands. What then? You are not trying her for the murder","Great Expectations"
"of her child; why don’t you? As to this case, if you _will_ have","Great Expectations"
"scratches, we say that, for anything we know, you may have accounted","Great Expectations"
"for them, assuming for the sake of argument that you have not invented","Great Expectations"
"them?” “To sum up, sir,” said Wemmick, “Mr. Jaggers was altogether too","Great Expectations"
"many for the jury, and they gave in.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Has she been in his service ever since?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes; but not only that,” said Wemmick, “she went into his service","Great Expectations"
"immediately after her acquittal, tamed as she is now. She has since","Great Expectations"
"been taught one thing and another in the way of her duties, but she was","Great Expectations"
"tamed from the beginning.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Do you remember the sex of the child?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Said to have been a girl.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You have nothing more to say to me to-night?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Nothing. I got your letter and destroyed it. Nothing.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We exchanged a cordial good-night, and I went home, with new matter for","Great Expectations"
"my thoughts, though with no relief from the old.","Great Expectations"

"Chapter XLIX.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Putting Miss Havisham’s note in my pocket, that it might serve as my","Great Expectations"
"credentials for so soon reappearing at Satis House, in case her","Great Expectations"
"waywardness should lead her to express any surprise at seeing me, I","Great Expectations"
"went down again by the coach next day. But I alighted at the Halfway","Great Expectations"
"House, and breakfasted there, and walked the rest of the distance; for","Great Expectations"
"I sought to get into the town quietly by the unfrequented ways, and to","Great Expectations"
"leave it in the same manner.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The best light of the day was gone when I passed along the quiet","Great Expectations"
"echoing courts behind the High Street. The nooks of ruin where the old","Great Expectations"
"monks had once had their refectories and gardens, and where the strong","Great Expectations"
"walls were now pressed into the service of humble sheds and stables,","Great Expectations"
"were almost as silent as the old monks in their graves. The cathedral","Great Expectations"
"chimes had at once a sadder and a more remote sound to me, as I hurried","Great Expectations"
"on avoiding observation, than they had ever had before; so, the swell","Great Expectations"
"of the old organ was borne to my ears like funeral music; and the","Great Expectations"
"rooks, as they hovered about the grey tower and swung in the bare high","Great Expectations"
"trees of the priory garden, seemed to call to me that the place was","Great Expectations"
"changed, and that Estella was gone out of it for ever.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"An elderly woman, whom I had seen before as one of the servants who","Great Expectations"
"lived in the supplementary house across the back courtyard, opened the","Great Expectations"
"gate. The lighted candle stood in the dark passage within, as of old,","Great Expectations"
"and I took it up and ascended the staircase alone. Miss Havisham was","Great Expectations"
"not in her own room, but was in the larger room across the landing.","Great Expectations"
"Looking in at the door, after knocking in vain, I saw her sitting on","Great Expectations"
"the hearth in a ragged chair, close before, and lost in the","Great Expectations"
"contemplation of, the ashy fire.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Doing as I had often done, I went in, and stood touching the old","Great Expectations"
"chimney-piece, where she could see me when she raised her eyes. There","Great Expectations"
"was an air of utter loneliness upon her, that would have moved me to","Great Expectations"
"pity though she had wilfully done me a deeper injury than I could","Great Expectations"
"charge her with. As I stood compassionating her, and thinking how, in","Great Expectations"
"the progress of time, I too had come to be a part of the wrecked","Great Expectations"
"fortunes of that house, her eyes rested on me. She stared, and said in","Great Expectations"
"a low voice, “Is it real?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It is I, Pip. Mr. Jaggers gave me your note yesterday, and I have lost","Great Expectations"
"no time.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Thank you. Thank you.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As I brought another of the ragged chairs to the hearth and sat down, I","Great Expectations"
"remarked a new expression on her face, as if she were afraid of me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I want,” she said, “to pursue that subject you mentioned to me when","Great Expectations"
"you were last here, and to show you that I am not all stone. But","Great Expectations"
"perhaps you can never believe, now, that there is anything human in my","Great Expectations"
"heart?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"When I said some reassuring words, she stretched out her tremulous","Great Expectations"
"right hand, as though she was going to touch me; but she recalled it","Great Expectations"
"again before I understood the action, or knew how to receive it.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You said, speaking for your friend, that you could tell me how to do","Great Expectations"
"something useful and good. Something that you would like done, is it","Great Expectations"
"not?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Something that I would like done very much.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What is it?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I began explaining to her that secret history of the partnership. I had","Great Expectations"
"not got far into it, when I judged from her looks that she was thinking","Great Expectations"
"in a discursive way of me, rather than of what I said. It seemed to be","Great Expectations"
"so; for, when I stopped speaking, many moments passed before she showed","Great Expectations"
"that she was conscious of the fact.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Do you break off,” she asked then, with her former air of being afraid","Great Expectations"
"of me, “because you hate me too much to bear to speak to me?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No, no,” I answered, “how can you think so, Miss Havisham! I stopped","Great Expectations"
"because I thought you were not following what I said.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Perhaps I was not,” she answered, putting a hand to her head. “Begin","Great Expectations"
"again, and let me look at something else. Stay! Now tell me.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"She set her hand upon her stick in the resolute way that sometimes was","Great Expectations"
"habitual to her, and looked at the fire with a strong expression of","Great Expectations"
"forcing herself to attend. I went on with my explanation, and told her","Great Expectations"
"how I had hoped to complete the transaction out of my means, but how in","Great Expectations"
"this I was disappointed. That part of the subject (I reminded her)","Great Expectations"
"involved matters which could form no part of my explanation, for they","Great Expectations"
"were the weighty secrets of another.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“So!” said she, assenting with her head, but not looking at me. “And","Great Expectations"
"how much money is wanting to complete the purchase?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I was rather afraid of stating it, for it sounded a large sum. “Nine","Great Expectations"
"hundred pounds.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“If I give you the money for this purpose, will you keep my secret as","Great Expectations"
"you have kept your own?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Quite as faithfully.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And your mind will be more at rest?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Much more at rest.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Are you very unhappy now?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"She asked this question, still without looking at me, but in an","Great Expectations"
"unwonted tone of sympathy. I could not reply at the moment, for my","Great Expectations"
"voice failed me. She put her left arm across the head of her stick, and","Great Expectations"
"softly laid her forehead on it.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I am far from happy, Miss Havisham; but I have other causes of","Great Expectations"
"disquiet than any you know of. They are the secrets I have mentioned.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"After a little while, she raised her head, and looked at the fire","Great Expectations"
"again.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It is noble in you to tell me that you have other causes of","Great Expectations"
"unhappiness. Is it true?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Too true.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Can I only serve you, Pip, by serving your friend? Regarding that as","Great Expectations"
"done, is there nothing I can do for you yourself?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Nothing. I thank you for the question. I thank you even more for the","Great Expectations"
"tone of the question. But there is nothing.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"She presently rose from her seat, and looked about the blighted room","Great Expectations"
"for the means of writing. There were none there, and she took from her","Great Expectations"
"pocket a yellow set of ivory tablets, mounted in tarnished gold, and","Great Expectations"
"wrote upon them with a pencil in a case of tarnished gold that hung","Great Expectations"
"from her neck.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You are still on friendly terms with Mr. Jaggers?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Quite. I dined with him yesterday.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“This is an authority to him to pay you that money, to lay out at your","Great Expectations"
"irresponsible discretion for your friend. I keep no money here; but if","Great Expectations"
"you would rather Mr. Jaggers knew nothing of the matter, I will send it","Great Expectations"
"to you.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Thank you, Miss Havisham; I have not the least objection to receiving","Great Expectations"
"it from him.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"She read me what she had written; and it was direct and clear, and","Great Expectations"
"evidently intended to absolve me from any suspicion of profiting by the","Great Expectations"
"receipt of the money. I took the tablets from her hand, and it trembled","Great Expectations"
"again, and it trembled more as she took off the chain to which the","Great Expectations"
"pencil was attached, and put it in mine. All this she did without","Great Expectations"
"looking at me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“My name is on the first leaf. If you can ever write under my name, “I","Great Expectations"
"forgive her,” though ever so long after my broken heart is dust pray do","Great Expectations"
"it!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“O Miss Havisham,” said I, “I can do it now. There have been sore","Great Expectations"
"mistakes; and my life has been a blind and thankless one; and I want","Great Expectations"
"forgiveness and direction far too much, to be bitter with you.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"She turned her face to me for the first time since she had averted it,","Great Expectations"
"and, to my amazement, I may even add to my terror, dropped on her knees","Great Expectations"
"at my feet; with her folded hands raised to me in the manner in which,","Great Expectations"
"when her poor heart was young and fresh and whole, they must often have","Great Expectations"
"been raised to heaven from her mother’s side.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"To see her with her white hair and her worn face kneeling at my feet","Great Expectations"
"gave me a shock through all my frame. I entreated her to rise, and got","Great Expectations"
"my arms about her to help her up; but she only pressed that hand of","Great Expectations"
"mine which was nearest to her grasp, and hung her head over it and","Great Expectations"
"wept. I had never seen her shed a tear before, and, in the hope that","Great Expectations"
"the relief might do her good, I bent over her without speaking. She was","Great Expectations"
"not kneeling now, but was down upon the ground.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“O!” she cried, despairingly. “What have I done! What have I done!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“If you mean, Miss Havisham, what have you done to injure me, let me","Great Expectations"
"answer. Very little. I should have loved her under any circumstances.","Great Expectations"
"Is she married?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was a needless question, for a new desolation in the desolate house","Great Expectations"
"had told me so.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What have I done! What have I done!” She wrung her hands, and crushed","Great Expectations"
"her white hair, and returned to this cry over and over again. “What","Great Expectations"
"have I done!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I knew not how to answer, or how to comfort her. That she had done a","Great Expectations"
"grievous thing in taking an impressionable child to mould into the form","Great Expectations"
"that her wild resentment, spurned affection, and wounded pride found","Great Expectations"
"vengeance in, I knew full well. But that, in shutting out the light of","Great Expectations"
"day, she had shut out infinitely more; that, in seclusion, she had","Great Expectations"
"secluded herself from a thousand natural and healing influences; that,","Great Expectations"
"her mind, brooding solitary, had grown diseased, as all minds do and","Great Expectations"
"must and will that reverse the appointed order of their Maker, I knew","Great Expectations"
"equally well. And could I look upon her without compassion, seeing her","Great Expectations"
"punishment in the ruin she was, in her profound unfitness for this","Great Expectations"
"earth on which she was placed, in the vanity of sorrow which had become","Great Expectations"
"a master mania, like the vanity of penitence, the vanity of remorse,","Great Expectations"
"the vanity of unworthiness, and other monstrous vanities that have been","Great Expectations"
"curses in this world?","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Until you spoke to her the other day, and until I saw in you a","Great Expectations"
"looking-glass that showed me what I once felt myself, I did not know","Great Expectations"
"what I had done. What have I done! What have I done!” And so again,","Great Expectations"
"twenty, fifty times over, What had she done!","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Miss Havisham,” I said, when her cry had died away, “you may dismiss","Great Expectations"
"me from your mind and conscience. But Estella is a different case, and","Great Expectations"
"if you can ever undo any scrap of what you have done amiss in keeping a","Great Expectations"
"part of her right nature away from her, it will be better to do that","Great Expectations"
"than to bemoan the past through a hundred years.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, yes, I know it. But, Pip—my dear!” There was an earnest womanly","Great Expectations"
"compassion for me in her new affection. “My dear! Believe this: when","Great Expectations"
"she first came to me, I meant to save her from misery like my own. At","Great Expectations"
"first, I meant no more.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well, well!” said I. “I hope so.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“But as she grew, and promised to be very beautiful, I gradually did","Great Expectations"
"worse, and with my praises, and with my jewels, and with my teachings,","Great Expectations"
"and with this figure of myself always before her, a warning to back and","Great Expectations"
"point my lessons, I stole her heart away, and put ice in its place.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Better,” I could not help saying, “to have left her a natural heart,","Great Expectations"
"even to be bruised or broken.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"With that, Miss Havisham looked distractedly at me for a while, and","Great Expectations"
"then burst out again, What had she done!","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“If you knew all my story,” she pleaded, “you would have some","Great Expectations"
"compassion for me and a better understanding of me.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Miss Havisham,” I answered, as delicately as I could, “I believe I may","Great Expectations"
"say that I do know your story, and have known it ever since I first","Great Expectations"
"left this neighbourhood. It has inspired me with great commiseration,","Great Expectations"
"and I hope I understand it and its influences. Does what has passed","Great Expectations"
"between us give me any excuse for asking you a question relative to","Great Expectations"
"Estella? Not as she is, but as she was when she first came here?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"She was seated on the ground, with her arms on the ragged chair, and","Great Expectations"
"her head leaning on them. She looked full at me when I said this, and","Great Expectations"
"replied, “Go on.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Whose child was Estella?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"She shook her head.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You don’t know?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"She shook her head again.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“But Mr. Jaggers brought her here, or sent her here?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Brought her here.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Will you tell me how that came about?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"She answered in a low whisper and with caution: “I had been shut up in","Great Expectations"
"these rooms a long time (I don’t know how long; you know what time the","Great Expectations"
"clocks keep here), when I told him that I wanted a little girl to rear","Great Expectations"
"and love, and save from my fate. I had first seen him when I sent for","Great Expectations"
"him to lay this place waste for me; having read of him in the","Great Expectations"
"newspapers, before I and the world parted. He told me that he would","Great Expectations"
"look about him for such an orphan child. One night he brought her here","Great Expectations"
"asleep, and I called her Estella.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Might I ask her age then?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Two or three. She herself knows nothing, but that she was left an","Great Expectations"
"orphan and I adopted her.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"So convinced I was of that woman’s being her mother, that I wanted no","Great Expectations"
"evidence to establish the fact in my own mind. But, to any mind, I","Great Expectations"
"thought, the connection here was clear and straight.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"What more could I hope to do by prolonging the interview? I had","Great Expectations"
"succeeded on behalf of Herbert, Miss Havisham had told me all she knew","Great Expectations"
"of Estella, I had said and done what I could to ease her mind. No","Great Expectations"
"matter with what other words we parted; we parted.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Twilight was closing in when I went downstairs into the natural air. I","Great Expectations"
"called to the woman who had opened the gate when I entered, that I","Great Expectations"
"would not trouble her just yet, but would walk round the place before","Great Expectations"
"leaving. For I had a presentiment that I should never be there again,","Great Expectations"
"and I felt that the dying light was suited to my last view of it.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"By the wilderness of casks that I had walked on long ago, and on which","Great Expectations"
"the rain of years had fallen since, rotting them in many places, and","Great Expectations"
"leaving miniature swamps and pools of water upon those that stood on","Great Expectations"
"end, I made my way to the ruined garden. I went all round it; round by","Great Expectations"
"the corner where Herbert and I had fought our battle; round by the","Great Expectations"
"paths where Estella and I had walked. So cold, so lonely, so dreary","Great Expectations"
"all!","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Taking the brewery on my way back, I raised the rusty latch of a little","Great Expectations"
"door at the garden end of it, and walked through. I was going out at","Great Expectations"
"the opposite door,—not easy to open now, for the damp wood had started","Great Expectations"
"and swelled, and the hinges were yielding, and the threshold was","Great Expectations"
"encumbered with a growth of fungus,—when I turned my head to look back.","Great Expectations"
"A childish association revived with wonderful force in the moment of","Great Expectations"
"the slight action, and I fancied that I saw Miss Havisham hanging to","Great Expectations"
"the beam. So strong was the impression, that I stood under the beam","Great Expectations"
"shuddering from head to foot before I knew it was a fancy,—though to be","Great Expectations"
"sure I was there in an instant.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The mournfulness of the place and time, and the great terror of this","Great Expectations"
"illusion, though it was but momentary, caused me to feel an","Great Expectations"
"indescribable awe as I came out between the open wooden gates where I","Great Expectations"
"had once wrung my hair after Estella had wrung my heart. Passing on","Great Expectations"
"into the front courtyard, I hesitated whether to call the woman to let","Great Expectations"
"me out at the locked gate of which she had the key, or first to go","Great Expectations"
"upstairs and assure myself that Miss Havisham was as safe and well as I","Great Expectations"
"had left her. I took the latter course and went up.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I looked into the room where I had left her, and I saw her seated in","Great Expectations"
"the ragged chair upon the hearth close to the fire, with her back","Great Expectations"
"towards me. In the moment when I was withdrawing my head to go quietly","Great Expectations"
"away, I saw a great flaming light spring up. In the same moment I saw","Great Expectations"
"her running at me, shrieking, with a whirl of fire blazing all about","Great Expectations"
"her, and soaring at least as many feet above her head as she was high.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I had a double-caped great-coat on, and over my arm another thick coat.","Great Expectations"
"That I got them off, closed with her, threw her down, and got them over","Great Expectations"
"her; that I dragged the great cloth from the table for the same","Great Expectations"
"purpose, and with it dragged down the heap of rottenness in the midst,","Great Expectations"
"and all the ugly things that sheltered there; that we were on the","Great Expectations"
"ground struggling like desperate enemies, and that the closer I covered","Great Expectations"
"her, the more wildly she shrieked and tried to free herself,—that this","Great Expectations"
"occurred I knew through the result, but not through anything I felt, or","Great Expectations"
"thought, or knew I did. I knew nothing until I knew that we were on the","Great Expectations"
"floor by the great table, and that patches of tinder yet alight were","Great Expectations"
"floating in the smoky air, which, a moment ago, had been her faded","Great Expectations"
"bridal dress.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Then, I looked round and saw the disturbed beetles and spiders running","Great Expectations"
"away over the floor, and the servants coming in with breathless cries","Great Expectations"
"at the door. I still held her forcibly down with all my strength, like","Great Expectations"
"a prisoner who might escape; and I doubt if I even knew who she was, or","Great Expectations"
"why we had struggled, or that she had been in flames, or that the","Great Expectations"
"flames were out, until I saw the patches of tinder that had been her","Great Expectations"
"garments no longer alight but falling in a black shower around us.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"She was insensible, and I was afraid to have her moved, or even","Great Expectations"
"touched. Assistance was sent for, and I held her until it came, as if I","Great Expectations"
"unreasonably fancied (I think I did) that, if I let her go, the fire","Great Expectations"
"would break out again and consume her. When I got up, on the surgeon’s","Great Expectations"
"coming to her with other aid, I was astonished to see that both my","Great Expectations"
"hands were burnt; for, I had no knowledge of it through the sense of","Great Expectations"
"feeling.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"On examination it was pronounced that she had received serious hurts,","Great Expectations"
"but that they of themselves were far from hopeless; the danger lay","Great Expectations"
"mainly in the nervous shock. By the surgeon’s directions, her bed was","Great Expectations"
"carried into that room and laid upon the great table, which happened to","Great Expectations"
"be well suited to the dressing of her injuries. When I saw her again,","Great Expectations"
"an hour afterwards, she lay, indeed, where I had seen her strike her","Great Expectations"
"stick, and had heard her say that she would lie one day.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Though every vestige of her dress was burnt, as they told me, she still","Great Expectations"
"had something of her old ghastly bridal appearance; for, they had","Great Expectations"
"covered her to the throat with white cotton-wool, and as she lay with a","Great Expectations"
"white sheet loosely overlying that, the phantom air of something that","Great Expectations"
"had been and was changed was still upon her.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I found, on questioning the servants, that Estella was in Paris, and I","Great Expectations"
"got a promise from the surgeon that he would write to her by the next","Great Expectations"
"post. Miss Havisham’s family I took upon myself; intending to","Great Expectations"
"communicate with Mr. Matthew Pocket only, and leave him to do as he","Great Expectations"
"liked about informing the rest. This I did next day, through Herbert,","Great Expectations"
"as soon as I returned to town.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"There was a stage, that evening, when she spoke collectedly of what had","Great Expectations"
"happened, though with a certain terrible vivacity. Towards midnight she","Great Expectations"
"began to wander in her speech; and after that it gradually set in that","Great Expectations"
"she said innumerable times in a low solemn voice, “What have I done!”","Great Expectations"
"And then, “When she first came, I meant to save her from misery like","Great Expectations"
"mine.” And then, “Take the pencil and write under my name, ‘I forgive","Great Expectations"
"her!’” She never changed the order of these three sentences, but she","Great Expectations"
"sometimes left out a word in one or other of them; never putting in","Great Expectations"
"another word, but always leaving a blank and going on to the next word.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As I could do no service there, and as I had, nearer home, that","Great Expectations"
"pressing reason for anxiety and fear which even her wanderings could","Great Expectations"
"not drive out of my mind, I decided, in the course of the night that I","Great Expectations"
"would return by the early morning coach, walking on a mile or so, and","Great Expectations"
"being taken up clear of the town. At about six o’clock of the morning,","Great Expectations"
"therefore, I leaned over her and touched her lips with mine, just as","Great Expectations"
"they said, not stopping for being touched, “Take the pencil and write","Great Expectations"
"under my name, ‘I forgive her.’”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Chapter L.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"My hands had been dressed twice or thrice in the night, and again in","Great Expectations"
"the morning. My left arm was a good deal burned to the elbow, and, less","Great Expectations"
"severely, as high as the shoulder; it was very painful, but the flames","Great Expectations"
"had set in that direction, and I felt thankful it was no worse. My","Great Expectations"
"right hand was not so badly burnt but that I could move the fingers. It","Great Expectations"
"was bandaged, of course, but much less inconveniently than my left hand","Great Expectations"
"and arm; those I carried in a sling; and I could only wear my coat like","Great Expectations"
"a cloak, loose over my shoulders and fastened at the neck. My hair had","Great Expectations"
"been caught by the fire, but not my head or face.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"When Herbert had been down to Hammersmith and seen his father, he came","Great Expectations"
"back to me at our chambers, and devoted the day to attending on me. He","Great Expectations"
"was the kindest of nurses, and at stated times took off the bandages,","Great Expectations"
"and steeped them in the cooling liquid that was kept ready, and put","Great Expectations"
"them on again, with a patient tenderness that I was deeply grateful","Great Expectations"
"for.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"At first, as I lay quiet on the sofa, I found it painfully difficult, I","Great Expectations"
"might say impossible, to get rid of the impression of the glare of the","Great Expectations"
"flames, their hurry and noise, and the fierce burning smell. If I dozed","Great Expectations"
"for a minute, I was awakened by Miss Havisham’s cries, and by her","Great Expectations"
"running at me with all that height of fire above her head. This pain of","Great Expectations"
"the mind was much harder to strive against than any bodily pain I","Great Expectations"
"suffered; and Herbert, seeing that, did his utmost to hold my attention","Great Expectations"
"engaged.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Neither of us spoke of the boat, but we both thought of it. That was","Great Expectations"
"made apparent by our avoidance of the subject, and by our","Great Expectations"
"agreeing—without agreement—to make my recovery of the use of my hands a","Great Expectations"
"question of so many hours, not of so many weeks.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"My first question when I saw Herbert had been of course, whether all","Great Expectations"
"was well down the river? As he replied in the affirmative, with perfect","Great Expectations"
"confidence and cheerfulness, we did not resume the subject until the","Great Expectations"
"day was wearing away. But then, as Herbert changed the bandages, more","Great Expectations"
"by the light of the fire than by the outer light, he went back to it","Great Expectations"
"spontaneously.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I sat with Provis last night, Handel, two good hours.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Where was Clara?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Dear little thing!” said Herbert. “She was up and down with","Great Expectations"
"Gruffandgrim all the evening. He was perpetually pegging at the floor","Great Expectations"
"the moment she left his sight. I doubt if he can hold out long, though.","Great Expectations"
"What with rum and pepper,—and pepper and rum,—I should think his","Great Expectations"
"pegging must be nearly over.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And then you will be married, Herbert?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“How can I take care of the dear child otherwise?—Lay your arm out upon","Great Expectations"
"the back of the sofa, my dear boy, and I’ll sit down here, and get the","Great Expectations"
"bandage off so gradually that you shall not know when it comes. I was","Great Expectations"
"speaking of Provis. Do you know, Handel, he improves?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I said to you I thought he was softened when I last saw him.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“So you did. And so he is. He was very communicative last night, and","Great Expectations"
"told me more of his life. You remember his breaking off here about some","Great Expectations"
"woman that he had had great trouble with.—Did I hurt you?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I had started, but not under his touch. His words had given me a start.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I had forgotten that, Herbert, but I remember it now you speak of it.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well! He went into that part of his life, and a dark wild part it is.","Great Expectations"
"Shall I tell you? Or would it worry you just now?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Tell me by all means. Every word.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Herbert bent forward to look at me more nearly, as if my reply had been","Great Expectations"
"rather more hurried or more eager than he could quite account for.","Great Expectations"
"“Your head is cool?” he said, touching it.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Quite,” said I. “Tell me what Provis said, my dear Herbert.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It seems,” said Herbert, “—there’s a bandage off most charmingly, and","Great Expectations"
"now comes the cool one,—makes you shrink at first, my poor dear fellow,","Great Expectations"
"don’t it? but it will be comfortable presently,—it seems that the woman","Great Expectations"
"was a young woman, and a jealous woman, and a revengeful woman;","Great Expectations"
"revengeful, Handel, to the last degree.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“To what last degree?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Murder.—Does it strike too cold on that sensitive place?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I don’t feel it. How did she murder? Whom did she murder?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Why, the deed may not have merited quite so terrible a name,” said","Great Expectations"
"Herbert, “but, she was tried for it, and Mr. Jaggers defended her, and","Great Expectations"
"the reputation of that defence first made his name known to Provis. It","Great Expectations"
"was another and a stronger woman who was the victim, and there had been","Great Expectations"
"a struggle—in a barn. Who began it, or how fair it was, or how unfair,","Great Expectations"
"may be doubtful; but how it ended is certainly not doubtful, for the","Great Expectations"
"victim was found throttled.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Was the woman brought in guilty?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No; she was acquitted.—My poor Handel, I hurt you!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It is impossible to be gentler, Herbert. Yes? What else?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“This acquitted young woman and Provis had a little child; a little","Great Expectations"
"child of whom Provis was exceedingly fond. On the evening of the very","Great Expectations"
"night when the object of her jealousy was strangled as I tell you, the","Great Expectations"
"young woman presented herself before Provis for one moment, and swore","Great Expectations"
"that she would destroy the child (which was in her possession), and he","Great Expectations"
"should never see it again; then she vanished.—There’s the worst arm","Great Expectations"
"comfortably in the sling once more, and now there remains but the right","Great Expectations"
"hand, which is a far easier job. I can do it better by this light than","Great Expectations"
"by a stronger, for my hand is steadiest when I don’t see the poor","Great Expectations"
"blistered patches too distinctly.—You don’t think your breathing is","Great Expectations"
"affected, my dear boy? You seem to breathe quickly.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Perhaps I do, Herbert. Did the woman keep her oath?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“There comes the darkest part of Provis’s life. She did.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“That is, he says she did.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Why, of course, my dear boy,” returned Herbert, in a tone of surprise,","Great Expectations"
"and again bending forward to get a nearer look at me. “He says it all.","Great Expectations"
"I have no other information.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No, to be sure.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Now, whether,” pursued Herbert, “he had used the child’s mother ill,","Great Expectations"
"or whether he had used the child’s mother well, Provis doesn’t say; but","Great Expectations"
"she had shared some four or five years of the wretched life he","Great Expectations"
"described to us at this fireside, and he seems to have felt pity for","Great Expectations"
"her, and forbearance towards her. Therefore, fearing he should be","Great Expectations"
"called upon to depose about this destroyed child, and so be the cause","Great Expectations"
"of her death, he hid himself (much as he grieved for the child), kept","Great Expectations"
"himself dark, as he says, out of the way and out of the trial, and was","Great Expectations"
"only vaguely talked of as a certain man called Abel, out of whom the","Great Expectations"
"jealousy arose. After the acquittal she disappeared, and thus he lost","Great Expectations"
"the child and the child’s mother.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I want to ask—”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“A moment, my dear boy, and I have done. That evil genius, Compeyson,","Great Expectations"
"the worst of scoundrels among many scoundrels, knowing of his keeping","Great Expectations"
"out of the way at that time and of his reasons for doing so, of course","Great Expectations"
"afterwards held the knowledge over his head as a means of keeping him","Great Expectations"
"poorer and working him harder. It was clear last night that this barbed","Great Expectations"
"the point of Provis’s animosity.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I want to know,” said I, “and particularly, Herbert, whether he told","Great Expectations"
"you when this happened?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Particularly? Let me remember, then, what he said as to that. His","Great Expectations"
"expression was, ‘a round score o’ year ago, and a’most directly after I","Great Expectations"
"took up wi’ Compeyson.’ How old were you when you came upon him in the","Great Expectations"
"little churchyard?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I think in my seventh year.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Ay. It had happened some three or four years then, he said, and you","Great Expectations"
"brought into his mind the little girl so tragically lost, who would","Great Expectations"
"have been about your age.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Herbert,” said I, after a short silence, in a hurried way, “can you","Great Expectations"
"see me best by the light of the window, or the light of the fire?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“By the firelight,” answered Herbert, coming close again.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Look at me.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I do look at you, my dear boy.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Touch me.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I do touch you, my dear boy.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You are not afraid that I am in any fever, or that my head is much","Great Expectations"
"disordered by the accident of last night?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“N-no, my dear boy,” said Herbert, after taking time to examine me.","Great Expectations"
"“You are rather excited, but you are quite yourself.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I know I am quite myself. And the man we have in hiding down the","Great Expectations"
"river, is Estella’s Father.”","Great Expectations"

"","Great Expectations"
"Chapter LI.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"What purpose I had in view when I was hot on tracing out and proving","Great Expectations"
"Estella’s parentage, I cannot say. It will presently be seen that the","Great Expectations"
"question was not before me in a distinct shape until it was put before","Great Expectations"
"me by a wiser head than my own.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"But when Herbert and I had held our momentous conversation, I was","Great Expectations"
"seized with a feverish conviction that I ought to hunt the matter","Great Expectations"
"down,—that I ought not to let it rest, but that I ought to see Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Jaggers, and come at the bare truth. I really do not know whether I","Great Expectations"
"felt that I did this for Estella’s sake, or whether I was glad to","Great Expectations"
"transfer to the man in whose preservation I was so much concerned some","Great Expectations"
"rays of the romantic interest that had so long surrounded me. Perhaps","Great Expectations"
"the latter possibility may be the nearer to the truth.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Any way, I could scarcely be withheld from going out to Gerrard Street","Great Expectations"
"that night. Herbert’s representations that, if I did, I should probably","Great Expectations"
"be laid up and stricken useless, when our fugitive’s safety would","Great Expectations"
"depend upon me, alone restrained my impatience. On the understanding,","Great Expectations"
"again and again reiterated, that, come what would, I was to go to Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Jaggers to-morrow, I at length submitted to keep quiet, and to have my","Great Expectations"
"hurts looked after, and to stay at home. Early next morning we went out","Great Expectations"
"together, and at the corner of Giltspur Street by Smithfield, I left","Great Expectations"
"Herbert to go his way into the City, and took my way to Little Britain.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"There were periodical occasions when Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick went over","Great Expectations"
"the office accounts, and checked off the vouchers, and put all things","Great Expectations"
"straight. On these occasions, Wemmick took his books and papers into","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Jaggers’s room, and one of the upstairs clerks came down into the","Great Expectations"
"outer office. Finding such clerk on Wemmick’s post that morning, I knew","Great Expectations"
"what was going on; but I was not sorry to have Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick","Great Expectations"
"together, as Wemmick would then hear for himself that I said nothing to","Great Expectations"
"compromise him.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"My appearance, with my arm bandaged and my coat loose over my","Great Expectations"
"shoulders, favoured my object. Although I had sent Mr. Jaggers a brief","Great Expectations"
"account of the accident as soon as I had arrived in town, yet I had to","Great Expectations"
"give him all the details now; and the speciality of the occasion caused","Great Expectations"
"our talk to be less dry and hard, and less strictly regulated by the","Great Expectations"
"rules of evidence, than it had been before. While I described the","Great Expectations"
"disaster, Mr. Jaggers stood, according to his wont, before the fire.","Great Expectations"
"Wemmick leaned back in his chair, staring at me, with his hands in the","Great Expectations"
"pockets of his trousers, and his pen put horizontally into the post.","Great Expectations"
"The two brutal casts, always inseparable in my mind from the official","Great Expectations"
"proceedings, seemed to be congestively considering whether they didn’t","Great Expectations"
"smell fire at the present moment.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"My narrative finished, and their questions exhausted, I then produced","Great Expectations"
"Miss Havisham’s authority to receive the nine hundred pounds for","Great Expectations"
"Herbert. Mr. Jaggers’s eyes retired a little deeper into his head when","Great Expectations"
"I handed him the tablets, but he presently handed them over to Wemmick,","Great Expectations"
"with instructions to draw the check for his signature. While that was","Great Expectations"
"in course of being done, I looked on at Wemmick as he wrote, and Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Jaggers, poising and swaying himself on his well-polished boots, looked","Great Expectations"
"on at me. “I am sorry, Pip,” said he, as I put the check in my pocket,","Great Expectations"
"when he had signed it, “that we do nothing for _you_.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Miss Havisham was good enough to ask me,” I returned, “whether she","Great Expectations"
"could do nothing for me, and I told her No.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Everybody should know his own business,” said Mr. Jaggers. And I saw","Great Expectations"
"Wemmick’s lips form the words “portable property.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I should _not_ have told her No, if I had been you,” said Mr Jaggers;","Great Expectations"
"“but every man ought to know his own business best.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Every man’s business,” said Wemmick, rather reproachfully towards me,","Great Expectations"
"“is portable property.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As I thought the time was now come for pursuing the theme I had at","Great Expectations"
"heart, I said, turning on Mr. Jaggers:—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I did ask something of Miss Havisham, however, sir. I asked her to","Great Expectations"
"give me some information relative to her adopted daughter, and she gave","Great Expectations"
"me all she possessed.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Did she?” said Mr. Jaggers, bending forward to look at his boots and","Great Expectations"
"then straightening himself. “Hah! I don’t think I should have done so,","Great Expectations"
"if I had been Miss Havisham. But _she_ ought to know her own business","Great Expectations"
"best.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I know more of the history of Miss Havisham’s adopted child than Miss","Great Expectations"
"Havisham herself does, sir. I know her mother.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Jaggers looked at me inquiringly, and repeated “Mother?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I have seen her mother within these three days.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes?” said Mr. Jaggers.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And so have you, sir. And you have seen her still more recently.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes?” said Mr. Jaggers.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Perhaps I know more of Estella’s history than even you do,” said I. “I","Great Expectations"
"know her father too.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"A certain stop that Mr. Jaggers came to in his manner—he was too","Great Expectations"
"self-possessed to change his manner, but he could not help its being","Great Expectations"
"brought to an indefinably attentive stop—assured me that he did not","Great Expectations"
"know who her father was. This I had strongly suspected from Provis’s","Great Expectations"
"account (as Herbert had repeated it) of his having kept himself dark;","Great Expectations"
"which I pieced on to the fact that he himself was not Mr. Jaggers’s","Great Expectations"
"client until some four years later, and when he could have no reason","Great Expectations"
"for claiming his identity. But, I could not be sure of this","Great Expectations"
"unconsciousness on Mr. Jaggers’s part before, though I was quite sure","Great Expectations"
"of it now.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“So! You know the young lady’s father, Pip?” said Mr. Jaggers.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes,” I replied, “and his name is Provis—from New South Wales.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Even Mr. Jaggers started when I said those words. It was the slightest","Great Expectations"
"start that could escape a man, the most carefully repressed and the","Great Expectations"
"sooner checked, but he did start, though he made it a part of the","Great Expectations"
"action of taking out his pocket-handkerchief. How Wemmick received the","Great Expectations"
"announcement I am unable to say; for I was afraid to look at him just","Great Expectations"
"then, lest Mr. Jaggers’s sharpness should detect that there had been","Great Expectations"
"some communication unknown to him between us.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And on what evidence, Pip,” asked Mr. Jaggers, very coolly, as he","Great Expectations"
"paused with his handkerchief half way to his nose, “does Provis make","Great Expectations"
"this claim?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“He does not make it,” said I, “and has never made it, and has no","Great Expectations"
"knowledge or belief that his daughter is in existence.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"For once, the powerful pocket-handkerchief failed. My reply was so","Great Expectations"
"unexpected, that Mr. Jaggers put the handkerchief back into his pocket","Great Expectations"
"without completing the usual performance, folded his arms, and looked","Great Expectations"
"with stern attention at me, though with an immovable face.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Then I told him all I knew, and how I knew it; with the one reservation","Great Expectations"
"that I left him to infer that I knew from Miss Havisham what I in fact","Great Expectations"
"knew from Wemmick. I was very careful indeed as to that. Nor did I look","Great Expectations"
"towards Wemmick until I had finished all I had to tell, and had been","Great Expectations"
"for some time silently meeting Mr. Jaggers’s look. When I did at last","Great Expectations"
"turn my eyes in Wemmick’s direction, I found that he had unposted his","Great Expectations"
"pen, and was intent upon the table before him.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Hah!” said Mr. Jaggers at last, as he moved towards the papers on the","Great Expectations"
"table. “What item was it you were at, Wemmick, when Mr. Pip came in?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"But I could not submit to be thrown off in that way, and I made a","Great Expectations"
"passionate, almost an indignant appeal, to him to be more frank and","Great Expectations"
"manly with me. I reminded him of the false hopes into which I had","Great Expectations"
"lapsed, the length of time they had lasted, and the discovery I had","Great Expectations"
"made: and I hinted at the danger that weighed upon my spirits. I","Great Expectations"
"represented myself as being surely worthy of some little confidence","Great Expectations"
"from him, in return for the confidence I had just now imparted. I said","Great Expectations"
"that I did not blame him, or suspect him, or mistrust him, but I wanted","Great Expectations"
"assurance of the truth from him. And if he asked me why I wanted it,","Great Expectations"
"and why I thought I had any right to it, I would tell him, little as he","Great Expectations"
"cared for such poor dreams, that I had loved Estella dearly and long,","Great Expectations"
"and that although I had lost her, and must live a bereaved life,","Great Expectations"
"whatever concerned her was still nearer and dearer to me than anything","Great Expectations"
"else in the world. And seeing that Mr. Jaggers stood quite still and","Great Expectations"
"silent, and apparently quite obdurate, under this appeal, I turned to","Great Expectations"
"Wemmick, and said, “Wemmick, I know you to be a man with a gentle","Great Expectations"
"heart. I have seen your pleasant home, and your old father, and all the","Great Expectations"
"innocent, cheerful playful ways with which you refresh your business","Great Expectations"
"life. And I entreat you to say a word for me to Mr. Jaggers, and to","Great Expectations"
"represent to him that, all circumstances considered, he ought to be","Great Expectations"
"more open with me!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I have never seen two men look more oddly at one another than Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Jaggers and Wemmick did after this apostrophe. At first, a misgiving","Great Expectations"
"crossed me that Wemmick would be instantly dismissed from his","Great Expectations"
"employment; but it melted as I saw Mr. Jaggers relax into something","Great Expectations"
"like a smile, and Wemmick become bolder.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What’s all this?” said Mr. Jaggers. “You with an old father, and you","Great Expectations"
"with pleasant and playful ways?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well!” returned Wemmick. “If I don’t bring ’em here, what does it","Great Expectations"
"matter?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Pip,” said Mr. Jaggers, laying his hand upon my arm, and smiling","Great Expectations"
"openly, “this man must be the most cunning impostor in all London.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Not a bit of it,” returned Wemmick, growing bolder and bolder. “I","Great Expectations"
"think you’re another.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Again they exchanged their former odd looks, each apparently still","Great Expectations"
"distrustful that the other was taking him in.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“_You_ with a pleasant home?” said Mr. Jaggers.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Since it don’t interfere with business,” returned Wemmick, “let it be","Great Expectations"
"so. Now, I look at you, sir, I shouldn’t wonder if _you_ might be","Great Expectations"
"planning and contriving to have a pleasant home of your own one of","Great Expectations"
"these days, when you’re tired of all this work.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Jaggers nodded his head retrospectively two or three times, and","Great Expectations"
"actually drew a sigh. “Pip,” said he, “we won’t talk about ‘poor","Great Expectations"
"dreams;’ you know more about such things than I, having much fresher","Great Expectations"
"experience of that kind. But now about this other matter. I’ll put a","Great Expectations"
"case to you. Mind! I admit nothing.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He waited for me to declare that I quite understood that he expressly","Great Expectations"
"said that he admitted nothing.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Now, Pip,” said Mr. Jaggers, “put this case. Put the case that a","Great Expectations"
"woman, under such circumstances as you have mentioned, held her child","Great Expectations"
"concealed, and was obliged to communicate the fact to her legal","Great Expectations"
"adviser, on his representing to her that he must know, with an eye to","Great Expectations"
"the latitude of his defence, how the fact stood about that child. Put","Great Expectations"
"the case that, at the same time he held a trust to find a child for an","Great Expectations"
"eccentric rich lady to adopt and bring up.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I follow you, sir.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Put the case that he lived in an atmosphere of evil, and that all he","Great Expectations"
"saw of children was their being generated in great numbers for certain","Great Expectations"
"destruction. Put the case that he often saw children solemnly tried at","Great Expectations"
"a criminal bar, where they were held up to be seen; put the case that","Great Expectations"
"he habitually knew of their being imprisoned, whipped, transported,","Great Expectations"
"neglected, cast out, qualified in all ways for the hangman, and growing","Great Expectations"
"up to be hanged. Put the case that pretty nigh all the children he saw","Great Expectations"
"in his daily business life he had reason to look upon as so much spawn,","Great Expectations"
"to develop into the fish that were to come to his net,—to be","Great Expectations"
"prosecuted, defended, forsworn, made orphans, bedevilled somehow.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I follow you, sir.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Put the case, Pip, that here was one pretty little child out of the","Great Expectations"
"heap who could be saved; whom the father believed dead, and dared make","Great Expectations"
"no stir about; as to whom, over the mother, the legal adviser had this","Great Expectations"
"power: “I know what you did, and how you did it. You came so and so,","Great Expectations"
"you did such and such things to divert suspicion. I have tracked you","Great Expectations"
"through it all, and I tell it you all. Part with the child, unless it","Great Expectations"
"should be necessary to produce it to clear you, and then it shall be","Great Expectations"
"produced. Give the child into my hands, and I will do my best to bring","Great Expectations"
"you off. If you are saved, your child is saved too; if you are lost,","Great Expectations"
"your child is still saved.” Put the case that this was done, and that","Great Expectations"
"the woman was cleared.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I understand you perfectly.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“But that I make no admissions?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“That you make no admissions.” And Wemmick repeated, “No admissions.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Put the case, Pip, that passion and the terror of death had a little","Great Expectations"
"shaken the woman’s intellects, and that when she was set at liberty,","Great Expectations"
"she was scared out of the ways of the world, and went to him to be","Great Expectations"
"sheltered. Put the case that he took her in, and that he kept down the","Great Expectations"
"old, wild, violent nature whenever he saw an inkling of its breaking","Great Expectations"
"out, by asserting his power over her in the old way. Do you comprehend","Great Expectations"
"the imaginary case?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Quite.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Put the case that the child grew up, and was married for money. That","Great Expectations"
"the mother was still living. That the father was still living. That the","Great Expectations"
"mother and father, unknown to one another, were dwelling within so many","Great Expectations"
"miles, furlongs, yards if you like, of one another. That the secret was","Great Expectations"
"still a secret, except that you had got wind of it. Put that last case","Great Expectations"
"to yourself very carefully.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I do.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I ask Wemmick to put it to _him_self very carefully.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"And Wemmick said, “I do.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“For whose sake would you reveal the secret? For the father’s? I think","Great Expectations"
"he would not be much the better for the mother. For the mother’s? I","Great Expectations"
"think if she had done such a deed she would be safer where she was. For","Great Expectations"
"the daughter’s? I think it would hardly serve her to establish her","Great Expectations"
"parentage for the information of her husband, and to drag her back to","Great Expectations"
"disgrace, after an escape of twenty years, pretty secure to last for","Great Expectations"
"life. But add the case that you had loved her, Pip, and had made her","Great Expectations"
"the subject of those ‘poor dreams’ which have, at one time or another,","Great Expectations"
"been in the heads of more men than you think likely, then I tell you","Great Expectations"
"that you had better—and would much sooner when you had thought well of","Great Expectations"
"it—chop off that bandaged left hand of yours with your bandaged right","Great Expectations"
"hand, and then pass the chopper on to Wemmick there, to cut _that_ off","Great Expectations"
"too.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I looked at Wemmick, whose face was very grave. He gravely touched his","Great Expectations"
"lips with his forefinger. I did the same. Mr. Jaggers did the same.","Great Expectations"
"“Now, Wemmick,” said the latter then, resuming his usual manner, “what","Great Expectations"
"item was it you were at when Mr. Pip came in?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Standing by for a little, while they were at work, I observed that the","Great Expectations"
"odd looks they had cast at one another were repeated several times:","Great Expectations"
"with this difference now, that each of them seemed suspicious, not to","Great Expectations"
"say conscious, of having shown himself in a weak and unprofessional","Great Expectations"
"light to the other. For this reason, I suppose, they were now","Great Expectations"
"inflexible with one another; Mr. Jaggers being highly dictatorial, and","Great Expectations"
"Wemmick obstinately justifying himself whenever there was the smallest","Great Expectations"
"point in abeyance for a moment. I had never seen them on such ill","Great Expectations"
"terms; for generally they got on very well indeed together.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"But they were both happily relieved by the opportune appearance of","Great Expectations"
"Mike, the client with the fur cap and the habit of wiping his nose on","Great Expectations"
"his sleeve, whom I had seen on the very first day of my appearance","Great Expectations"
"within those walls. This individual, who, either in his own person or","Great Expectations"
"in that of some member of his family, seemed to be always in trouble","Great Expectations"
"(which in that place meant Newgate), called to announce that his eldest","Great Expectations"
"daughter was taken up on suspicion of shoplifting. As he imparted this","Great Expectations"
"melancholy circumstance to Wemmick, Mr. Jaggers standing magisterially","Great Expectations"
"before the fire and taking no share in the proceedings, Mike’s eye","Great Expectations"
"happened to twinkle with a tear.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What are you about?” demanded Wemmick, with the utmost indignation.","Great Expectations"
"“What do you come snivelling here for?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I didn’t go to do it, Mr. Wemmick.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You did,” said Wemmick. “How dare you? You’re not in a fit state to","Great Expectations"
"come here, if you can’t come here without spluttering like a bad pen.","Great Expectations"
"What do you mean by it?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“A man can’t help his feelings, Mr. Wemmick,” pleaded Mike.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“His what?” demanded Wemmick, quite savagely. “Say that again!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Now look here my man,” said Mr. Jaggers, advancing a step, and","Great Expectations"
"pointing to the door. “Get out of this office. I’ll have no feelings","Great Expectations"
"here. Get out.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It serves you right,” said Wemmick, “Get out.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"So, the unfortunate Mike very humbly withdrew, and Mr. Jaggers and","Great Expectations"
"Wemmick appeared to have re-established their good understanding, and","Great Expectations"
"went to work again with an air of refreshment upon them as if they had","Great Expectations"
"just had lunch.","Great Expectations"

"Chapter LII.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"From Little Britain I went, with my check in my pocket, to Miss","Great Expectations"
"Skiffins’s brother, the accountant; and Miss Skiffins’s brother, the","Great Expectations"
"accountant, going straight to Clarriker’s and bringing Clarriker to me,","Great Expectations"
"I had the great satisfaction of concluding that arrangement. It was the","Great Expectations"
"only good thing I had done, and the only completed thing I had done,","Great Expectations"
"since I was first apprised of my great expectations.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Clarriker informing me on that occasion that the affairs of the House","Great Expectations"
"were steadily progressing, that he would now be able to establish a","Great Expectations"
"small branch-house in the East which was much wanted for the extension","Great Expectations"
"of the business, and that Herbert in his new partnership capacity would","Great Expectations"
"go out and take charge of it, I found that I must have prepared for a","Great Expectations"
"separation from my friend, even though my own affairs had been more","Great Expectations"
"settled. And now, indeed, I felt as if my last anchor were loosening","Great Expectations"
"its hold, and I should soon be driving with the winds and waves.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"But there was recompense in the joy with which Herbert would come home","Great Expectations"
"of a night and tell me of these changes, little imagining that he told","Great Expectations"
"me no news, and would sketch airy pictures of himself conducting Clara","Great Expectations"
"Barley to the land of the Arabian Nights, and of me going out to join","Great Expectations"
"them (with a caravan of camels, I believe), and of our all going up the","Great Expectations"
"Nile and seeing wonders. Without being sanguine as to my own part in","Great Expectations"
"those bright plans, I felt that Herbert’s way was clearing fast, and","Great Expectations"
"that old Bill Barley had but to stick to his pepper and rum, and his","Great Expectations"
"daughter would soon be happily provided for.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We had now got into the month of March. My left arm, though it","Great Expectations"
"presented no bad symptoms, took, in the natural course, so long to heal","Great Expectations"
"that I was still unable to get a coat on. My right arm was tolerably","Great Expectations"
"restored; disfigured, but fairly serviceable.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"On a Monday morning, when Herbert and I were at breakfast, I received","Great Expectations"
"the following letter from Wemmick by the post.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Walworth. Burn this as soon as read. Early in the week, or say","Great Expectations"
"Wednesday, you might do what you know of, if you felt disposed to try","Great Expectations"
"it. Now burn.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"When I had shown this to Herbert and had put it in the fire—but not","Great Expectations"
"before we had both got it by heart—we considered what to do. For, of","Great Expectations"
"course my being disabled could now be no longer kept out of view.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I have thought it over again and again,” said Herbert, “and I think I","Great Expectations"
"know a better course than taking a Thames waterman. Take Startop. A","Great Expectations"
"good fellow, a skilled hand, fond of us, and enthusiastic and","Great Expectations"
"honourable.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I had thought of him more than once.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“But how much would you tell him, Herbert?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It is necessary to tell him very little. Let him suppose it a mere","Great Expectations"
"freak, but a secret one, until the morning comes: then let him know","Great Expectations"
"that there is urgent reason for your getting Provis aboard and away.","Great Expectations"
"You go with him?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No doubt.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Where?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It had seemed to me, in the many anxious considerations I had given the","Great Expectations"
"point, almost indifferent what port we made for,—Hamburg, Rotterdam,","Great Expectations"
"Antwerp,—the place signified little, so that he was out of England. Any","Great Expectations"
"foreign steamer that fell in our way and would take us up would do. I","Great Expectations"
"had always proposed to myself to get him well down the river in the","Great Expectations"
"boat; certainly well beyond Gravesend, which was a critical place for","Great Expectations"
"search or inquiry if suspicion were afoot. As foreign steamers would","Great Expectations"
"leave London at about the time of high-water, our plan would be to get","Great Expectations"
"down the river by a previous ebb-tide, and lie by in some quiet spot","Great Expectations"
"until we could pull off to one. The time when one would be due where we","Great Expectations"
"lay, wherever that might be, could be calculated pretty nearly, if we","Great Expectations"
"made inquiries beforehand.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Herbert assented to all this, and we went out immediately after","Great Expectations"
"breakfast to pursue our investigations. We found that a steamer for","Great Expectations"
"Hamburg was likely to suit our purpose best, and we directed our","Great Expectations"
"thoughts chiefly to that vessel. But we noted down what other foreign","Great Expectations"
"steamers would leave London with the same tide, and we satisfied","Great Expectations"
"ourselves that we knew the build and colour of each. We then separated","Great Expectations"
"for a few hours: I, to get at once such passports as were necessary;","Great Expectations"
"Herbert, to see Startop at his lodgings. We both did what we had to do","Great Expectations"
"without any hindrance, and when we met again at one o’clock reported it","Great Expectations"
"done. I, for my part, was prepared with passports; Herbert had seen","Great Expectations"
"Startop, and he was more than ready to join.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Those two should pull a pair of oars, we settled, and I would steer;","Great Expectations"
"our charge would be sitter, and keep quiet; as speed was not our","Great Expectations"
"object, we should make way enough. We arranged that Herbert should not","Great Expectations"
"come home to dinner before going to Mill Pond Bank that evening; that","Great Expectations"
"he should not go there at all to-morrow evening, Tuesday; that he","Great Expectations"
"should prepare Provis to come down to some stairs hard by the house, on","Great Expectations"
"Wednesday, when he saw us approach, and not sooner; that all the","Great Expectations"
"arrangements with him should be concluded that Monday night; and that","Great Expectations"
"he should be communicated with no more in any way, until we took him on","Great Expectations"
"board.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"These precautions well understood by both of us, I went home.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"On opening the outer door of our chambers with my key, I found a letter","Great Expectations"
"in the box, directed to me; a very dirty letter, though not","Great Expectations"
"ill-written. It had been delivered by hand (of course, since I left","Great Expectations"
"home), and its contents were these:—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“If you are not afraid to come to the old marshes to-night or to-morrow","Great Expectations"
"night at nine, and to come to the little sluice-house by the limekiln,","Great Expectations"
"you had better come. If you want information regarding _your uncle","Great Expectations"
"Provis_, you had much better come and tell no one, and lose no time.","Great Expectations"
"_You must come alone_. Bring this with you.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I had had load enough upon my mind before the receipt of this strange","Great Expectations"
"letter. What to do now, I could not tell. And the worst was, that I","Great Expectations"
"must decide quickly, or I should miss the afternoon coach, which would","Great Expectations"
"take me down in time for to-night. To-morrow night I could not think of","Great Expectations"
"going, for it would be too close upon the time of the flight. And","Great Expectations"
"again, for anything I knew, the proffered information might have some","Great Expectations"
"important bearing on the flight itself.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"If I had had ample time for consideration, I believe I should still","Great Expectations"
"have gone. Having hardly any time for consideration,—my watch showing","Great Expectations"
"me that the coach started within half an hour,—I resolved to go. I","Great Expectations"
"should certainly not have gone, but for the reference to my Uncle","Great Expectations"
"Provis. That, coming on Wemmick’s letter and the morning’s busy","Great Expectations"
"preparation, turned the scale.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It is so difficult to become clearly possessed of the contents of","Great Expectations"
"almost any letter, in a violent hurry, that I had to read this","Great Expectations"
"mysterious epistle again twice, before its injunction to me to be","Great Expectations"
"secret got mechanically into my mind. Yielding to it in the same","Great Expectations"
"mechanical kind of way, I left a note in pencil for Herbert, telling","Great Expectations"
"him that as I should be so soon going away, I knew not for how long, I","Great Expectations"
"had decided to hurry down and back, to ascertain for myself how Miss","Great Expectations"
"Havisham was faring. I had then barely time to get my great-coat, lock","Great Expectations"
"up the chambers, and make for the coach-office by the short by-ways. If","Great Expectations"
"I had taken a hackney-chariot and gone by the streets, I should have","Great Expectations"
"missed my aim; going as I did, I caught the coach just as it came out","Great Expectations"
"of the yard. I was the only inside passenger, jolting away knee-deep in","Great Expectations"
"straw, when I came to myself.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"For I really had not been myself since the receipt of the letter; it","Great Expectations"
"had so bewildered me, ensuing on the hurry of the morning. The morning","Great Expectations"
"hurry and flutter had been great; for, long and anxiously as I had","Great Expectations"
"waited for Wemmick, his hint had come like a surprise at last. And now","Great Expectations"
"I began to wonder at myself for being in the coach, and to doubt","Great Expectations"
"whether I had sufficient reason for being there, and to consider","Great Expectations"
"whether I should get out presently and go back, and to argue against","Great Expectations"
"ever heeding an anonymous communication, and, in short, to pass through","Great Expectations"
"all those phases of contradiction and indecision to which I suppose","Great Expectations"
"very few hurried people are strangers. Still, the reference to Provis","Great Expectations"
"by name mastered everything. I reasoned as I had reasoned already","Great Expectations"
"without knowing it,—if that be reasoning,—in case any harm should","Great Expectations"
"befall him through my not going, how could I ever forgive myself!","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was dark before we got down, and the journey seemed long and dreary","Great Expectations"
"to me, who could see little of it inside, and who could not go outside","Great Expectations"
"in my disabled state. Avoiding the Blue Boar, I put up at an inn of","Great Expectations"
"minor reputation down the town, and ordered some dinner. While it was","Great Expectations"
"preparing, I went to Satis House and inquired for Miss Havisham; she","Great Expectations"
"was still very ill, though considered something better.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"My inn had once been a part of an ancient ecclesiastical house, and I","Great Expectations"
"dined in a little octagonal common-room, like a font. As I was not able","Great Expectations"
"to cut my dinner, the old landlord with a shining bald head did it for","Great Expectations"
"me. This bringing us into conversation, he was so good as to entertain","Great Expectations"
"me with my own story,—of course with the popular feature that","Great Expectations"
"Pumblechook was my earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortunes.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Do you know the young man?” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Know him!” repeated the landlord. “Ever since he was—no height at","Great Expectations"
"all.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Does he ever come back to this neighbourhood?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Ay, he comes back,” said the landlord, “to his great friends, now and","Great Expectations"
"again, and gives the cold shoulder to the man that made him.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What man is that?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Him that I speak of,” said the landlord. “Mr. Pumblechook.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Is he ungrateful to no one else?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No doubt he would be, if he could,” returned the landlord, “but he","Great Expectations"
"can’t. And why? Because Pumblechook done everything for him.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Does Pumblechook say so?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Say so!” replied the landlord. “He han’t no call to say so.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“But does he say so?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It would turn a man’s blood to white wine winegar to hear him tell of","Great Expectations"
"it, sir,” said the landlord.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I thought, “Yet Joe, dear Joe, _you_ never tell of it. Long-suffering","Great Expectations"
"and loving Joe, _you_ never complain. Nor you, sweet-tempered Biddy!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Your appetite’s been touched like by your accident,” said the","Great Expectations"
"landlord, glancing at the bandaged arm under my coat. “Try a tenderer","Great Expectations"
"bit.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No, thank you,” I replied, turning from the table to brood over the","Great Expectations"
"fire. “I can eat no more. Please take it away.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I had never been struck at so keenly, for my thanklessness to Joe, as","Great Expectations"
"through the brazen impostor Pumblechook. The falser he, the truer Joe;","Great Expectations"
"the meaner he, the nobler Joe.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"My heart was deeply and most deservedly humbled as I mused over the","Great Expectations"
"fire for an hour or more. The striking of the clock aroused me, but not","Great Expectations"
"from my dejection or remorse, and I got up and had my coat fastened","Great Expectations"
"round my neck, and went out. I had previously sought in my pockets for","Great Expectations"
"the letter, that I might refer to it again; but I could not find it,","Great Expectations"
"and was uneasy to think that it must have been dropped in the straw of","Great Expectations"
"the coach. I knew very well, however, that the appointed place was the","Great Expectations"
"little sluice-house by the limekiln on the marshes, and the hour nine.","Great Expectations"
"Towards the marshes I now went straight, having no time to spare.","Great Expectations"

"Chapter LIII.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was a dark night, though the full moon rose as I left the enclosed","Great Expectations"
"lands, and passed out upon the marshes. Beyond their dark line there","Great Expectations"
"was a ribbon of clear sky, hardly broad enough to hold the red large","Great Expectations"
"moon. In a few minutes she had ascended out of that clear field, in","Great Expectations"
"among the piled mountains of cloud.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"There was a melancholy wind, and the marshes were very dismal. A","Great Expectations"
"stranger would have found them insupportable, and even to me they were","Great Expectations"
"so oppressive that I hesitated, half inclined to go back. But I knew","Great Expectations"
"them well, and could have found my way on a far darker night, and had","Great Expectations"
"no excuse for returning, being there. So, having come there against my","Great Expectations"
"inclination, I went on against it.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The direction that I took was not that in which my old home lay, nor","Great Expectations"
"that in which we had pursued the convicts. My back was turned towards","Great Expectations"
"the distant Hulks as I walked on, and, though I could see the old","Great Expectations"
"lights away on the spits of sand, I saw them over my shoulder. I knew","Great Expectations"
"the limekiln as well as I knew the old Battery, but they were miles","Great Expectations"
"apart; so that, if a light had been burning at each point that night,","Great Expectations"
"there would have been a long strip of the blank horizon between the two","Great Expectations"
"bright specks.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"At first, I had to shut some gates after me, and now and then to stand","Great Expectations"
"still while the cattle that were lying in the banked-up pathway arose","Great Expectations"
"and blundered down among the grass and reeds. But after a little while","Great Expectations"
"I seemed to have the whole flats to myself.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was another half-hour before I drew near to the kiln. The lime was","Great Expectations"
"burning with a sluggish stifling smell, but the fires were made up and","Great Expectations"
"left, and no workmen were visible. Hard by was a small stone-quarry. It","Great Expectations"
"lay directly in my way, and had been worked that day, as I saw by the","Great Expectations"
"tools and barrows that were lying about.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Coming up again to the marsh level out of this excavation,—for the rude","Great Expectations"
"path lay through it,—I saw a light in the old sluice-house. I quickened","Great Expectations"
"my pace, and knocked at the door with my hand. Waiting for some reply,","Great Expectations"
"I looked about me, noticing how the sluice was abandoned and broken,","Great Expectations"
"and how the house—of wood with a tiled roof—would not be proof against","Great Expectations"
"the weather much longer, if it were so even now, and how the mud and","Great Expectations"
"ooze were coated with lime, and how the choking vapour of the kiln","Great Expectations"
"crept in a ghostly way towards me. Still there was no answer, and I","Great Expectations"
"knocked again. No answer still, and I tried the latch.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It rose under my hand, and the door yielded. Looking in, I saw a","Great Expectations"
"lighted candle on a table, a bench, and a mattress on a truckle","Great Expectations"
"bedstead. As there was a loft above, I called, “Is there any one here?”","Great Expectations"
"but no voice answered. Then I looked at my watch, and, finding that it","Great Expectations"
"was past nine, called again, “Is there any one here?” There being still","Great Expectations"
"no answer, I went out at the door, irresolute what to do.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was beginning to rain fast. Seeing nothing save what I had seen","Great Expectations"
"already, I turned back into the house, and stood just within the","Great Expectations"
"shelter of the doorway, looking out into the night. While I was","Great Expectations"
"considering that some one must have been there lately and must soon be","Great Expectations"
"coming back, or the candle would not be burning, it came into my head","Great Expectations"
"to look if the wick were long. I turned round to do so, and had taken","Great Expectations"
"up the candle in my hand, when it was extinguished by some violent","Great Expectations"
"shock; and the next thing I comprehended was, that I had been caught in","Great Expectations"
"a strong running noose, thrown over my head from behind.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Now,” said a suppressed voice with an oath, “I’ve got you!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What is this?” I cried, struggling. “Who is it? Help, help, help!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Not only were my arms pulled close to my sides, but the pressure on my","Great Expectations"
"bad arm caused me exquisite pain. Sometimes, a strong man’s hand,","Great Expectations"
"sometimes a strong man’s breast, was set against my mouth to deaden my","Great Expectations"
"cries, and with a hot breath always close to me, I struggled","Great Expectations"
"ineffectually in the dark, while I was fastened tight to the wall. “And","Great Expectations"
"now,” said the suppressed voice with another oath, “call out again, and","Great Expectations"
"I’ll make short work of you!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Faint and sick with the pain of my injured arm, bewildered by the","Great Expectations"
"surprise, and yet conscious how easily this threat could be put in","Great Expectations"
"execution, I desisted, and tried to ease my arm were it ever so little.","Great Expectations"
"But, it was bound too tight for that. I felt as if, having been burnt","Great Expectations"
"before, it were now being boiled.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The sudden exclusion of the night, and the substitution of black","Great Expectations"
"darkness in its place, warned me that the man had closed a shutter.","Great Expectations"
"After groping about for a little, he found the flint and steel he","Great Expectations"
"wanted, and began to strike a light. I strained my sight upon the","Great Expectations"
"sparks that fell among the tinder, and upon which he breathed and","Great Expectations"
"breathed, match in hand, but I could only see his lips, and the blue","Great Expectations"
"point of the match; even those but fitfully. The tinder was damp,—no","Great Expectations"
"wonder there,—and one after another the sparks died out.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The man was in no hurry, and struck again with the flint and steel. As","Great Expectations"
"the sparks fell thick and bright about him, I could see his hands, and","Great Expectations"
"touches of his face, and could make out that he was seated and bending","Great Expectations"
"over the table; but nothing more. Presently I saw his blue lips again,","Great Expectations"
"breathing on the tinder, and then a flare of light flashed up, and","Great Expectations"
"showed me Orlick.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Whom I had looked for, I don’t know. I had not looked for him. Seeing","Great Expectations"
"him, I felt that I was in a dangerous strait indeed, and I kept my eyes","Great Expectations"
"upon him.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He lighted the candle from the flaring match with great deliberation,","Great Expectations"
"and dropped the match, and trod it out. Then he put the candle away","Great Expectations"
"from him on the table, so that he could see me, and sat with his arms","Great Expectations"
"folded on the table and looked at me. I made out that I was fastened to","Great Expectations"
"a stout perpendicular ladder a few inches from the wall,—a fixture","Great Expectations"
"there,—the means of ascent to the loft above.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Now,” said he, when we had surveyed one another for some time, “I’ve","Great Expectations"
"got you.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Unbind me. Let me go!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Ah!” he returned, “_I_’ll let you go. I’ll let you go to the moon,","Great Expectations"
"I’ll let you go to the stars. All in good time.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Why have you lured me here?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Don’t you know?” said he, with a deadly look.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Why have you set upon me in the dark?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Because I mean to do it all myself. One keeps a secret better than","Great Expectations"
"two. O you enemy, you enemy!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"His enjoyment of the spectacle I furnished, as he sat with his arms","Great Expectations"
"folded on the table, shaking his head at me and hugging himself, had a","Great Expectations"
"malignity in it that made me tremble. As I watched him in silence, he","Great Expectations"
"put his hand into the corner at his side, and took up a gun with a","Great Expectations"
"brass-bound stock.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Do you know this?” said he, making as if he would take aim at me. “Do","Great Expectations"
"you know where you saw it afore? Speak, wolf!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes,” I answered.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"[Illustration]","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You cost me that place. You did. Speak!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What else could I do?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You did that, and that would be enough, without more. How dared you to","Great Expectations"
"come betwixt me and a young woman I liked?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“When did I?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“When didn’t you? It was you as always give Old Orlick a bad name to","Great Expectations"
"her.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You gave it to yourself; you gained it for yourself. I could have done","Great Expectations"
"you no harm, if you had done yourself none.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You’re a liar. And you’ll take any pains, and spend any money, to","Great Expectations"
"drive me out of this country, will you?” said he, repeating my words to","Great Expectations"
"Biddy in the last interview I had with her. “Now, I’ll tell you a piece","Great Expectations"
"of information. It was never so well worth your while to get me out of","Great Expectations"
"this country as it is to-night. Ah! If it was all your money twenty","Great Expectations"
"times told, to the last brass farden!” As he shook his heavy hand at","Great Expectations"
"me, with his mouth snarling like a tiger’s, I felt that it was true.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What are you going to do to me?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I’m a-going,” said he, bringing his fist down upon the table with a","Great Expectations"
"heavy blow, and rising as the blow fell to give it greater force,—“I’m","Great Expectations"
"a-going to have your life!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He leaned forward staring at me, slowly unclenched his hand and drew it","Great Expectations"
"across his mouth as if his mouth watered for me, and sat down again.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You was always in Old Orlick’s way since ever you was a child. You","Great Expectations"
"goes out of his way this present night. He’ll have no more on you.","Great Expectations"
"You’re dead.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I felt that I had come to the brink of my grave. For a moment I looked","Great Expectations"
"wildly round my trap for any chance of escape; but there was none.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“More than that,” said he, folding his arms on the table again, “I","Great Expectations"
"won’t have a rag of you, I won’t have a bone of you, left on earth.","Great Expectations"
"I’ll put your body in the kiln,—I’d carry two such to it, on my","Great Expectations"
"shoulders—and, let people suppose what they may of you, they shall","Great Expectations"
"never know nothing.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"My mind, with inconceivable rapidity followed out all the consequences","Great Expectations"
"of such a death. Estella’s father would believe I had deserted him,","Great Expectations"
"would be taken, would die accusing me; even Herbert would doubt me,","Great Expectations"
"when he compared the letter I had left for him with the fact that I had","Great Expectations"
"called at Miss Havisham’s gate for only a moment; Joe and Biddy would","Great Expectations"
"never know how sorry I had been that night, none would ever know what I","Great Expectations"
"had suffered, how true I had meant to be, what an agony I had passed","Great Expectations"
"through. The death close before me was terrible, but far more terrible","Great Expectations"
"than death was the dread of being misremembered after death. And so","Great Expectations"
"quick were my thoughts, that I saw myself despised by unborn","Great Expectations"
"generations,—Estella’s children, and their children,—while the wretch’s","Great Expectations"
"words were yet on his lips.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Now, wolf,” said he, “afore I kill you like any other beast,—which is","Great Expectations"
"wot I mean to do and wot I have tied you up for,—I’ll have a good look","Great Expectations"
"at you and a good goad at you. O you enemy!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It had passed through my thoughts to cry out for help again; though few","Great Expectations"
"could know better than I, the solitary nature of the spot, and the","Great Expectations"
"hopelessness of aid. But as he sat gloating over me, I was supported by","Great Expectations"
"a scornful detestation of him that sealed my lips. Above all things, I","Great Expectations"
"resolved that I would not entreat him, and that I would die making some","Great Expectations"
"last poor resistance to him. Softened as my thoughts of all the rest of","Great Expectations"
"men were in that dire extremity; humbly beseeching pardon, as I did, of","Great Expectations"
"Heaven; melted at heart, as I was, by the thought that I had taken no","Great Expectations"
"farewell, and never now could take farewell of those who were dear to","Great Expectations"
"me, or could explain myself to them, or ask for their compassion on my","Great Expectations"
"miserable errors,—still, if I could have killed him, even in dying, I","Great Expectations"
"would have done it.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He had been drinking, and his eyes were red and bloodshot. Around his","Great Expectations"
"neck was slung a tin bottle, as I had often seen his meat and drink","Great Expectations"
"slung about him in other days. He brought the bottle to his lips, and","Great Expectations"
"took a fiery drink from it; and I smelt the strong spirits that I saw","Great Expectations"
"flash into his face.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Wolf!” said he, folding his arms again, “Old Orlick’s a-going to tell","Great Expectations"
"you somethink. It was you as did for your shrew sister.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Again my mind, with its former inconceivable rapidity, had exhausted","Great Expectations"
"the whole subject of the attack upon my sister, her illness, and her","Great Expectations"
"death, before his slow and hesitating speech had formed these words.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It was you, villain,” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I tell you it was your doing,—I tell you it was done through you,” he","Great Expectations"
"retorted, catching up the gun, and making a blow with the stock at the","Great Expectations"
"vacant air between us. “I come upon her from behind, as I come upon you","Great Expectations"
"to-night. _I_ giv’ it her! I left her for dead, and if there had been a","Great Expectations"
"limekiln as nigh her as there is now nigh you, she shouldn’t have come","Great Expectations"
"to life again. But it warn’t Old Orlick as did it; it was you. You was","Great Expectations"
"favoured, and he was bullied and beat. Old Orlick bullied and beat, eh?","Great Expectations"
"Now you pays for it. You done it; now you pays for it.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He drank again, and became more ferocious. I saw by his tilting of the","Great Expectations"
"bottle that there was no great quantity left in it. I distinctly","Great Expectations"
"understood that he was working himself up with its contents to make an","Great Expectations"
"end of me. I knew that every drop it held was a drop of my life. I knew","Great Expectations"
"that when I was changed into a part of the vapour that had crept","Great Expectations"
"towards me but a little while before, like my own warning ghost, he","Great Expectations"
"would do as he had done in my sister’s case,—make all haste to the","Great Expectations"
"town, and be seen slouching about there drinking at the alehouses. My","Great Expectations"
"rapid mind pursued him to the town, made a picture of the street with","Great Expectations"
"him in it, and contrasted its lights and life with the lonely marsh and","Great Expectations"
"the white vapour creeping over it, into which I should have dissolved.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was not only that I could have summed up years and years and years","Great Expectations"
"while he said a dozen words, but that what he did say presented","Great Expectations"
"pictures to me, and not mere words. In the excited and exalted state of","Great Expectations"
"my brain, I could not think of a place without seeing it, or of persons","Great Expectations"
"without seeing them. It is impossible to overstate the vividness of","Great Expectations"
"these images, and yet I was so intent, all the time, upon him","Great Expectations"
"himself,—who would not be intent on the tiger crouching to spring!—that","Great Expectations"
"I knew of the slightest action of his fingers.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"When he had drunk this second time, he rose from the bench on which he","Great Expectations"
"sat, and pushed the table aside. Then, he took up the candle, and,","Great Expectations"
"shading it with his murderous hand so as to throw its light on me,","Great Expectations"
"stood before me, looking at me and enjoying the sight.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Wolf, I’ll tell you something more. It was Old Orlick as you tumbled","Great Expectations"
"over on your stairs that night.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I saw the staircase with its extinguished lamps. I saw the shadows of","Great Expectations"
"the heavy stair-rails, thrown by the watchman’s lantern on the wall. I","Great Expectations"
"saw the rooms that I was never to see again; here, a door half open;","Great Expectations"
"there, a door closed; all the articles of furniture around.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And why was Old Orlick there? I’ll tell you something more, wolf. You","Great Expectations"
"and her _have_ pretty well hunted me out of this country, so far as","Great Expectations"
"getting a easy living in it goes, and I’ve took up with new companions,","Great Expectations"
"and new masters. Some of ’em writes my letters when I wants ’em","Great Expectations"
"wrote,—do you mind?—writes my letters, wolf! They writes fifty hands;","Great Expectations"
"they’re not like sneaking you, as writes but one. I’ve had a firm mind","Great Expectations"
"and a firm will to have your life, since you was down here at your","Great Expectations"
"sister’s burying. I han’t seen a way to get you safe, and I’ve looked","Great Expectations"
"arter you to know your ins and outs. For, says Old Orlick to himself,","Great Expectations"
"‘Somehow or another I’ll have him!’ What! When I looks for you, I finds","Great Expectations"
"your uncle Provis, eh?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mill Pond Bank, and Chinks’s Basin, and the Old Green Copper Rope-walk,","Great Expectations"
"all so clear and plain! Provis in his rooms, the signal whose use was","Great Expectations"
"over, pretty Clara, the good motherly woman, old Bill Barley on his","Great Expectations"
"back, all drifting by, as on the swift stream of my life fast running","Great Expectations"
"out to sea!","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“_You_ with a uncle too! Why, I know’d you at Gargery’s when you was so","Great Expectations"
"small a wolf that I could have took your weazen betwixt this finger and","Great Expectations"
"thumb and chucked you away dead (as I’d thoughts o’ doing, odd times,","Great Expectations"
"when I see you loitering amongst the pollards on a Sunday), and you","Great Expectations"
"hadn’t found no uncles then. No, not you! But when Old Orlick come for","Great Expectations"
"to hear that your uncle Provis had most like wore the leg-iron wot Old","Great Expectations"
"Orlick had picked up, filed asunder, on these meshes ever so many year","Great Expectations"
"ago, and wot he kep by him till he dropped your sister with it, like a","Great Expectations"
"bullock, as he means to drop you—hey?—when he come for to hear","Great Expectations"
"that—hey?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"In his savage taunting, he flared the candle so close at me that I","Great Expectations"
"turned my face aside to save it from the flame.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Ah!” he cried, laughing, after doing it again, “the burnt child dreads","Great Expectations"
"the fire! Old Orlick knowed you was burnt, Old Orlick knowed you was","Great Expectations"
"smuggling your uncle Provis away, Old Orlick’s a match for you and","Great Expectations"
"know’d you’d come to-night! Now I’ll tell you something more, wolf, and","Great Expectations"
"this ends it. There’s them that’s as good a match for your uncle Provis","Great Expectations"
"as Old Orlick has been for you. Let him ’ware them, when he’s lost his","Great Expectations"
"nevvy! Let him ’ware them, when no man can’t find a rag of his dear","Great Expectations"
"relation’s clothes, nor yet a bone of his body. There’s them that can’t","Great Expectations"
"and that won’t have Magwitch,—yes, _I_ know the name!—alive in the same","Great Expectations"
"land with them, and that’s had such sure information of him when he was","Great Expectations"
"alive in another land, as that he couldn’t and shouldn’t leave it","Great Expectations"
"unbeknown and put them in danger. P’raps it’s them that writes fifty","Great Expectations"
"hands, and that’s not like sneaking you as writes but one. ’Ware","Great Expectations"
"Compeyson, Magwitch, and the gallows!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He flared the candle at me again, smoking my face and hair, and for an","Great Expectations"
"instant blinding me, and turned his powerful back as he replaced the","Great Expectations"
"light on the table. I had thought a prayer, and had been with Joe and","Great Expectations"
"Biddy and Herbert, before he turned towards me again.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"There was a clear space of a few feet between the table and the","Great Expectations"
"opposite wall. Within this space, he now slouched backwards and","Great Expectations"
"forwards. His great strength seemed to sit stronger upon him than ever","Great Expectations"
"before, as he did this with his hands hanging loose and heavy at his","Great Expectations"
"sides, and with his eyes scowling at me. I had no grain of hope left.","Great Expectations"
"Wild as my inward hurry was, and wonderful the force of the pictures","Great Expectations"
"that rushed by me instead of thoughts, I could yet clearly understand","Great Expectations"
"that, unless he had resolved that I was within a few moments of surely","Great Expectations"
"perishing out of all human knowledge, he would never have told me what","Great Expectations"
"he had told.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Of a sudden, he stopped, took the cork out of his bottle, and tossed it","Great Expectations"
"away. Light as it was, I heard it fall like a plummet. He swallowed","Great Expectations"
"slowly, tilting up the bottle by little and little, and now he looked","Great Expectations"
"at me no more. The last few drops of liquor he poured into the palm of","Great Expectations"
"his hand, and licked up. Then, with a sudden hurry of violence and","Great Expectations"
"swearing horribly, he threw the bottle from him, and stooped; and I saw","Great Expectations"
"in his hand a stone-hammer with a long heavy handle.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The resolution I had made did not desert me, for, without uttering one","Great Expectations"
"vain word of appeal to him, I shouted out with all my might, and","Great Expectations"
"struggled with all my might. It was only my head and my legs that I","Great Expectations"
"could move, but to that extent I struggled with all the force, until","Great Expectations"
"then unknown, that was within me. In the same instant I heard","Great Expectations"
"responsive shouts, saw figures and a gleam of light dash in at the","Great Expectations"
"door, heard voices and tumult, and saw Orlick emerge from a struggle of","Great Expectations"
"men, as if it were tumbling water, clear the table at a leap, and fly","Great Expectations"
"out into the night.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"After a blank, I found that I was lying unbound, on the floor, in the","Great Expectations"
"same place, with my head on some one’s knee. My eyes were fixed on the","Great Expectations"
"ladder against the wall, when I came to myself,—had opened on it before","Great Expectations"
"my mind saw it,—and thus as I recovered consciousness, I knew that I","Great Expectations"
"was in the place where I had lost it.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Too indifferent at first, even to look round and ascertain who","Great Expectations"
"supported me, I was lying looking at the ladder, when there came","Great Expectations"
"between me and it a face. The face of Trabb’s boy!","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I think he’s all right!” said Trabb’s boy, in a sober voice; “but","Great Expectations"
"ain’t he just pale though!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"At these words, the face of him who supported me looked over into mine,","Great Expectations"
"and I saw my supporter to be—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Herbert! Great Heaven!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Softly,” said Herbert. “Gently, Handel. Don’t be too eager.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And our old comrade, Startop!” I cried, as he too bent over me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Remember what he is going to assist us in,” said Herbert, “and be","Great Expectations"
"calm.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The allusion made me spring up; though I dropped again from the pain in","Great Expectations"
"my arm. “The time has not gone by, Herbert, has it? What night is","Great Expectations"
"to-night? How long have I been here?” For, I had a strange and strong","Great Expectations"
"misgiving that I had been lying there a long time—a day and a","Great Expectations"
"night,—two days and nights,—more.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“The time has not gone by. It is still Monday night.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Thank God!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And you have all to-morrow, Tuesday, to rest in,” said Herbert. “But","Great Expectations"
"you can’t help groaning, my dear Handel. What hurt have you got? Can","Great Expectations"
"you stand?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, yes,” said I, “I can walk. I have no hurt but in this throbbing","Great Expectations"
"arm.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"They laid it bare, and did what they could. It was violently swollen","Great Expectations"
"and inflamed, and I could scarcely endure to have it touched. But, they","Great Expectations"
"tore up their handkerchiefs to make fresh bandages, and carefully","Great Expectations"
"replaced it in the sling, until we could get to the town and obtain","Great Expectations"
"some cooling lotion to put upon it. In a little while we had shut the","Great Expectations"
"door of the dark and empty sluice-house, and were passing through the","Great Expectations"
"quarry on our way back. Trabb’s boy—Trabb’s overgrown young man","Great Expectations"
"now—went before us with a lantern, which was the light I had seen come","Great Expectations"
"in at the door. But, the moon was a good two hours higher than when I","Great Expectations"
"had last seen the sky, and the night, though rainy, was much lighter.","Great Expectations"
"The white vapour of the kiln was passing from us as we went by, and as","Great Expectations"
"I had thought a prayer before, I thought a thanksgiving now.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Entreating Herbert to tell me how he had come to my rescue,—which at","Great Expectations"
"first he had flatly refused to do, but had insisted on my remaining","Great Expectations"
"quiet,—I learnt that I had in my hurry dropped the letter, open, in our","Great Expectations"
"chambers, where he, coming home to bring with him Startop whom he had","Great Expectations"
"met in the street on his way to me, found it, very soon after I was","Great Expectations"
"gone. Its tone made him uneasy, and the more so because of the","Great Expectations"
"inconsistency between it and the hasty letter I had left for him. His","Great Expectations"
"uneasiness increasing instead of subsiding, after a quarter of an","Great Expectations"
"hour’s consideration, he set off for the coach-office with Startop, who","Great Expectations"
"volunteered his company, to make inquiry when the next coach went down.","Great Expectations"
"Finding that the afternoon coach was gone, and finding that his","Great Expectations"
"uneasiness grew into positive alarm, as obstacles came in his way, he","Great Expectations"
"resolved to follow in a post-chaise. So he and Startop arrived at the","Great Expectations"
"Blue Boar, fully expecting there to find me, or tidings of me; but,","Great Expectations"
"finding neither, went on to Miss Havisham’s, where they lost me.","Great Expectations"
"Hereupon they went back to the hotel (doubtless at about the time when","Great Expectations"
"I was hearing the popular local version of my own story) to refresh","Great Expectations"
"themselves and to get some one to guide them out upon the marshes.","Great Expectations"
"Among the loungers under the Boar’s archway happened to be Trabb’s","Great Expectations"
"Boy,—true to his ancient habit of happening to be everywhere where he","Great Expectations"
"had no business,—and Trabb’s boy had seen me passing from Miss","Great Expectations"
"Havisham’s in the direction of my dining-place. Thus Trabb’s boy became","Great Expectations"
"their guide, and with him they went out to the sluice-house, though by","Great Expectations"
"the town way to the marshes, which I had avoided. Now, as they went","Great Expectations"
"along, Herbert reflected, that I might, after all, have been brought","Great Expectations"
"there on some genuine and serviceable errand tending to Provis’s","Great Expectations"
"safety, and, bethinking himself that in that case interruption must be","Great Expectations"
"mischievous, left his guide and Startop on the edge of the quarry, and","Great Expectations"
"went on by himself, and stole round the house two or three times,","Great Expectations"
"endeavouring to ascertain whether all was right within. As he could","Great Expectations"
"hear nothing but indistinct sounds of one deep rough voice (this was","Great Expectations"
"while my mind was so busy), he even at last began to doubt whether I","Great Expectations"
"was there, when suddenly I cried out loudly, and he answered the cries,","Great Expectations"
"and rushed in, closely followed by the other two.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"When I told Herbert what had passed within the house, he was for our","Great Expectations"
"immediately going before a magistrate in the town, late at night as it","Great Expectations"
"was, and getting out a warrant. But, I had already considered that such","Great Expectations"
"a course, by detaining us there, or binding us to come back, might be","Great Expectations"
"fatal to Provis. There was no gainsaying this difficulty, and we","Great Expectations"
"relinquished all thoughts of pursuing Orlick at that time. For the","Great Expectations"
"present, under the circumstances, we deemed it prudent to make rather","Great Expectations"
"light of the matter to Trabb’s boy; who, I am convinced, would have","Great Expectations"
"been much affected by disappointment, if he had known that his","Great Expectations"
"intervention saved me from the limekiln. Not that Trabb’s boy was of a","Great Expectations"
"malignant nature, but that he had too much spare vivacity, and that it","Great Expectations"
"was in his constitution to want variety and excitement at anybody’s","Great Expectations"
"expense. When we parted, I presented him with two guineas (which seemed","Great Expectations"
"to meet his views), and told him that I was sorry ever to have had an","Great Expectations"
"ill opinion of him (which made no impression on him at all).","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Wednesday being so close upon us, we determined to go back to London","Great Expectations"
"that night, three in the post-chaise; the rather, as we should then be","Great Expectations"
"clear away before the night’s adventure began to be talked of. Herbert","Great Expectations"
"got a large bottle of stuff for my arm; and by dint of having this","Great Expectations"
"stuff dropped over it all the night through, I was just able to bear","Great Expectations"
"its pain on the journey. It was daylight when we reached the Temple,","Great Expectations"
"and I went at once to bed, and lay in bed all day.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"My terror, as I lay there, of falling ill, and being unfitted for","Great Expectations"
"to-morrow, was so besetting, that I wonder it did not disable me of","Great Expectations"
"itself. It would have done so, pretty surely, in conjunction with the","Great Expectations"
"mental wear and tear I had suffered, but for the unnatural strain upon","Great Expectations"
"me that to-morrow was. So anxiously looked forward to, charged with","Great Expectations"
"such consequences, its results so impenetrably hidden, though so near.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"No precaution could have been more obvious than our refraining from","Great Expectations"
"communication with him that day; yet this again increased my","Great Expectations"
"restlessness. I started at every footstep and every sound, believing","Great Expectations"
"that he was discovered and taken, and this was the messenger to tell me","Great Expectations"
"so. I persuaded myself that I knew he was taken; that there was","Great Expectations"
"something more upon my mind than a fear or a presentiment; that the","Great Expectations"
"fact had occurred, and I had a mysterious knowledge of it. As the days","Great Expectations"
"wore on, and no ill news came, as the day closed in and darkness fell,","Great Expectations"
"my overshadowing dread of being disabled by illness before to-morrow","Great Expectations"
"morning altogether mastered me. My burning arm throbbed, and my burning","Great Expectations"
"head throbbed, and I fancied I was beginning to wander. I counted up to","Great Expectations"
"high numbers, to make sure of myself, and repeated passages that I knew","Great Expectations"
"in prose and verse. It happened sometimes that in the mere escape of a","Great Expectations"
"fatigued mind, I dozed for some moments or forgot; then I would say to","Great Expectations"
"myself with a start, “Now it has come, and I am turning delirious!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"They kept me very quiet all day, and kept my arm constantly dressed,","Great Expectations"
"and gave me cooling drinks. Whenever I fell asleep, I awoke with the","Great Expectations"
"notion I had had in the sluice-house, that a long time had elapsed and","Great Expectations"
"the opportunity to save him was gone. About midnight I got out of bed","Great Expectations"
"and went to Herbert, with the conviction that I had been asleep for","Great Expectations"
"four-and-twenty hours, and that Wednesday was past. It was the last","Great Expectations"
"self-exhausting effort of my fretfulness, for after that I slept","Great Expectations"
"soundly.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Wednesday morning was dawning when I looked out of window. The winking","Great Expectations"
"lights upon the bridges were already pale, the coming sun was like a","Great Expectations"
"marsh of fire on the horizon. The river, still dark and mysterious, was","Great Expectations"
"spanned by bridges that were turning coldly grey, with here and there","Great Expectations"
"at top a warm touch from the burning in the sky. As I looked along the","Great Expectations"
"clustered roofs, with church-towers and spires shooting into the","Great Expectations"
"unusually clear air, the sun rose up, and a veil seemed to be drawn","Great Expectations"
"from the river, and millions of sparkles burst out upon its waters.","Great Expectations"
"From me too, a veil seemed to be drawn, and I felt strong and well.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Herbert lay asleep in his bed, and our old fellow-student lay asleep on","Great Expectations"
"the sofa. I could not dress myself without help; but I made up the","Great Expectations"
"fire, which was still burning, and got some coffee ready for them. In","Great Expectations"
"good time they too started up strong and well, and we admitted the","Great Expectations"
"sharp morning air at the windows, and looked at the tide that was still","Great Expectations"
"flowing towards us.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“When it turns at nine o’clock,” said Herbert, cheerfully, “look out","Great Expectations"
"for us, and stand ready, you over there at Mill Pond Bank!”","Great Expectations"

"Chapter LIV.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was one of those March days when the sun shines hot and the wind","Great Expectations"
"blows cold: when it is summer in the light, and winter in the shade. We","Great Expectations"
"had our pea-coats with us, and I took a bag. Of all my worldly","Great Expectations"
"possessions I took no more than the few necessaries that filled the","Great Expectations"
"bag. Where I might go, what I might do, or when I might return, were","Great Expectations"
"questions utterly unknown to me; nor did I vex my mind with them, for","Great Expectations"
"it was wholly set on Provis’s safety. I only wondered for the passing","Great Expectations"
"moment, as I stopped at the door and looked back, under what altered","Great Expectations"
"circumstances I should next see those rooms, if ever.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We loitered down to the Temple stairs, and stood loitering there, as if","Great Expectations"
"we were not quite decided to go upon the water at all. Of course, I had","Great Expectations"
"taken care that the boat should be ready and everything in order. After","Great Expectations"
"a little show of indecision, which there were none to see but the two","Great Expectations"
"or three amphibious creatures belonging to our Temple stairs, we went","Great Expectations"
"on board and cast off; Herbert in the bow, I steering. It was then","Great Expectations"
"about high-water,—half-past eight.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Our plan was this. The tide, beginning to run down at nine, and being","Great Expectations"
"with us until three, we intended still to creep on after it had turned,","Great Expectations"
"and row against it until dark. We should then be well in those long","Great Expectations"
"reaches below Gravesend, between Kent and Essex, where the river is","Great Expectations"
"broad and solitary, where the water-side inhabitants are very few, and","Great Expectations"
"where lone public-houses are scattered here and there, of which we","Great Expectations"
"could choose one for a resting-place. There, we meant to lie by all","Great Expectations"
"night. The steamer for Hamburg and the steamer for Rotterdam would","Great Expectations"
"start from London at about nine on Thursday morning. We should know at","Great Expectations"
"what time to expect them, according to where we were, and would hail","Great Expectations"
"the first; so that, if by any accident we were not taken abroad, we","Great Expectations"
"should have another chance. We knew the distinguishing marks of each","Great Expectations"
"vessel.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The relief of being at last engaged in the execution of the purpose was","Great Expectations"
"so great to me that I felt it difficult to realise the condition in","Great Expectations"
"which I had been a few hours before. The crisp air, the sunlight, the","Great Expectations"
"movement on the river, and the moving river itself,—the road that ran","Great Expectations"
"with us, seeming to sympathise with us, animate us, and encourage us","Great Expectations"
"on,—freshened me with new hope. I felt mortified to be of so little use","Great Expectations"
"in the boat; but, there were few better oarsmen than my two friends,","Great Expectations"
"and they rowed with a steady stroke that was to last all day.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"At that time, the steam-traffic on the Thames was far below its present","Great Expectations"
"extent, and watermen’s boats were far more numerous. Of barges, sailing","Great Expectations"
"colliers, and coasting-traders, there were perhaps, as many as now; but","Great Expectations"
"of steam-ships, great and small, not a tithe or a twentieth part so","Great Expectations"
"many. Early as it was, there were plenty of scullers going here and","Great Expectations"
"there that morning, and plenty of barges dropping down with the tide;","Great Expectations"
"the navigation of the river between bridges, in an open boat, was a","Great Expectations"
"much easier and commoner matter in those days than it is in these; and","Great Expectations"
"we went ahead among many skiffs and wherries briskly.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Old London Bridge was soon passed, and old Billingsgate Market with its","Great Expectations"
"oyster-boats and Dutchmen, and the White Tower and Traitor’s Gate, and","Great Expectations"
"we were in among the tiers of shipping. Here were the Leith, Aberdeen,","Great Expectations"
"and Glasgow steamers, loading and unloading goods, and looking","Great Expectations"
"immensely high out of the water as we passed alongside; here, were","Great Expectations"
"colliers by the score and score, with the coal-whippers plunging off","Great Expectations"
"stages on deck, as counterweights to measures of coal swinging up,","Great Expectations"
"which were then rattled over the side into barges; here, at her","Great Expectations"
"moorings was to-morrow’s steamer for Rotterdam, of which we took good","Great Expectations"
"notice; and here to-morrow’s for Hamburg, under whose bowsprit we","Great Expectations"
"crossed. And now I, sitting in the stern, could see, with a faster","Great Expectations"
"beating heart, Mill Pond Bank and Mill Pond stairs.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Is he there?” said Herbert.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Not yet.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Right! He was not to come down till he saw us. Can you see his","Great Expectations"
"signal?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Not well from here; but I think I see it.—Now I see him! Pull both.","Great Expectations"
"Easy, Herbert. Oars!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We touched the stairs lightly for a single moment, and he was on board,","Great Expectations"
"and we were off again. He had a boat-cloak with him, and a black canvas","Great Expectations"
"bag; and he looked as like a river-pilot as my heart could have wished.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Dear boy!” he said, putting his arm on my shoulder, as he took his","Great Expectations"
"seat. “Faithful dear boy, well done. Thankye, thankye!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Again among the tiers of shipping, in and out, avoiding rusty","Great Expectations"
"chain-cables frayed hempen hawsers and bobbing buoys, sinking for the","Great Expectations"
"moment floating broken baskets, scattering floating chips of wood and","Great Expectations"
"shaving, cleaving floating scum of coal, in and out, under the","Great Expectations"
"figure-head of the _John of Sunderland_ making a speech to the winds","Great Expectations"
"(as is done by many Johns), and the _Betsy of Yarmouth_ with a firm","Great Expectations"
"formality of bosom and her knobby eyes starting two inches out of her","Great Expectations"
"head; in and out, hammers going in ship-builders’ yards, saws going at","Great Expectations"
"timber, clashing engines going at things unknown, pumps going in leaky","Great Expectations"
"ships, capstans going, ships going out to sea, and unintelligible","Great Expectations"
"sea-creatures roaring curses over the bulwarks at respondent","Great Expectations"
"lightermen, in and out,—out at last upon the clearer river, where the","Great Expectations"
"ships’ boys might take their fenders in, no longer fishing in troubled","Great Expectations"
"waters with them over the side, and where the festooned sails might fly","Great Expectations"
"out to the wind.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"At the stairs where we had taken him abroad, and ever since, I had","Great Expectations"
"looked warily for any token of our being suspected. I had seen none. We","Great Expectations"
"certainly had not been, and at that time as certainly we were not","Great Expectations"
"either attended or followed by any boat. If we had been waited on by","Great Expectations"
"any boat, I should have run in to shore, and have obliged her to go on,","Great Expectations"
"or to make her purpose evident. But we held our own without any","Great Expectations"
"appearance of molestation.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He had his boat-cloak on him, and looked, as I have said, a natural","Great Expectations"
"part of the scene. It was remarkable (but perhaps the wretched life he","Great Expectations"
"had led accounted for it) that he was the least anxious of any of us.","Great Expectations"
"He was not indifferent, for he told me that he hoped to live to see his","Great Expectations"
"gentleman one of the best of gentlemen in a foreign country; he was not","Great Expectations"
"disposed to be passive or resigned, as I understood it; but he had no","Great Expectations"
"notion of meeting danger half way. When it came upon him, he confronted","Great Expectations"
"it, but it must come before he troubled himself.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“If you knowed, dear boy,” he said to me, “what it is to sit here","Great Expectations"
"alonger my dear boy and have my smoke, arter having been day by day","Great Expectations"
"betwixt four walls, you’d envy me. But you don’t know what it is.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I think I know the delights of freedom,” I answered.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Ah,” said he, shaking his head gravely. “But you don’t know it equal","Great Expectations"
"to me. You must have been under lock and key, dear boy, to know it","Great Expectations"
"equal to me,—but I ain’t a-going to be low.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It occurred to me as inconsistent, that, for any mastering idea, he","Great Expectations"
"should have endangered his freedom, and even his life. But I reflected","Great Expectations"
"that perhaps freedom without danger was too much apart from all the","Great Expectations"
"habit of his existence to be to him what it would be to another man. I","Great Expectations"
"was not far out, since he said, after smoking a little:—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You see, dear boy, when I was over yonder, t’other side the world, I","Great Expectations"
"was always a looking to this side; and it come flat to be there, for","Great Expectations"
"all I was a growing rich. Everybody knowed Magwitch, and Magwitch could","Great Expectations"
"come, and Magwitch could go, and nobody’s head would be troubled about","Great Expectations"
"him. They ain’t so easy concerning me here, dear boy,—wouldn’t be,","Great Expectations"
"leastwise, if they knowed where I was.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“If all goes well,” said I, “you will be perfectly free and safe again","Great Expectations"
"within a few hours.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well,” he returned, drawing a long breath, “I hope so.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And think so?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He dipped his hand in the water over the boat’s gunwale, and said,","Great Expectations"
"smiling with that softened air upon him which was not new to me:—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Ay, I s’pose I think so, dear boy. We’d be puzzled to be more quiet","Great Expectations"
"and easy-going than we are at present. But—it’s a flowing so soft and","Great Expectations"
"pleasant through the water, p’raps, as makes me think it—I was a","Great Expectations"
"thinking through my smoke just then, that we can no more see to the","Great Expectations"
"bottom of the next few hours than we can see to the bottom of this","Great Expectations"
"river what I catches hold of. Nor yet we can’t no more hold their tide","Great Expectations"
"than I can hold this. And it’s run through my fingers and gone, you","Great Expectations"
"see!” holding up his dripping hand.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“But for your face I should think you were a little despondent,” said","Great Expectations"
"I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Not a bit on it, dear boy! It comes of flowing on so quiet, and of","Great Expectations"
"that there rippling at the boat’s head making a sort of a Sunday tune.","Great Expectations"
"Maybe I’m a growing a trifle old besides.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He put his pipe back in his mouth with an undisturbed expression of","Great Expectations"
"face, and sat as composed and contented as if we were already out of","Great Expectations"
"England. Yet he was as submissive to a word of advice as if he had been","Great Expectations"
"in constant terror; for, when we ran ashore to get some bottles of beer","Great Expectations"
"into the boat, and he was stepping out, I hinted that I thought he","Great Expectations"
"would be safest where he was, and he said. “Do you, dear boy?” and","Great Expectations"
"quietly sat down again.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The air felt cold upon the river, but it was a bright day, and the","Great Expectations"
"sunshine was very cheering. The tide ran strong, I took care to lose","Great Expectations"
"none of it, and our steady stroke carried us on thoroughly well. By","Great Expectations"
"imperceptible degrees, as the tide ran out, we lost more and more of","Great Expectations"
"the nearer woods and hills, and dropped lower and lower between the","Great Expectations"
"muddy banks, but the tide was yet with us when we were off Gravesend.","Great Expectations"
"As our charge was wrapped in his cloak, I purposely passed within a","Great Expectations"
"boat or two’s length of the floating Custom House, and so out to catch","Great Expectations"
"the stream, alongside of two emigrant ships, and under the bows of a","Great Expectations"
"large transport with troops on the forecastle looking down at us. And","Great Expectations"
"soon the tide began to slacken, and the craft lying at anchor to swing,","Great Expectations"
"and presently they had all swung round, and the ships that were taking","Great Expectations"
"advantage of the new tide to get up to the Pool began to crowd upon us","Great Expectations"
"in a fleet, and we kept under the shore, as much out of the strength of","Great Expectations"
"the tide now as we could, standing carefully off from low shallows and","Great Expectations"
"mudbanks.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Our oarsmen were so fresh, by dint of having occasionally let her drive","Great Expectations"
"with the tide for a minute or two, that a quarter of an hour’s rest","Great Expectations"
"proved full as much as they wanted. We got ashore among some slippery","Great Expectations"
"stones while we ate and drank what we had with us, and looked about. It","Great Expectations"
"was like my own marsh country, flat and monotonous, and with a dim","Great Expectations"
"horizon; while the winding river turned and turned, and the great","Great Expectations"
"floating buoys upon it turned and turned, and everything else seemed","Great Expectations"
"stranded and still. For now the last of the fleet of ships was round","Great Expectations"
"the last low point we had headed; and the last green barge,","Great Expectations"
"straw-laden, with a brown sail, had followed; and some","Great Expectations"
"ballast-lighters, shaped like a child’s first rude imitation of a boat,","Great Expectations"
"lay low in the mud; and a little squat shoal-lighthouse on open piles","Great Expectations"
"stood crippled in the mud on stilts and crutches; and slimy stakes","Great Expectations"
"stuck out of the mud, and slimy stones stuck out of the mud, and red","Great Expectations"
"landmarks and tidemarks stuck out of the mud, and an old landing-stage","Great Expectations"
"and an old roofless building slipped into the mud, and all about us was","Great Expectations"
"stagnation and mud.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We pushed off again, and made what way we could. It was much harder","Great Expectations"
"work now, but Herbert and Startop persevered, and rowed and rowed and","Great Expectations"
"rowed until the sun went down. By that time the river had lifted us a","Great Expectations"
"little, so that we could see above the bank. There was the red sun, on","Great Expectations"
"the low level of the shore, in a purple haze, fast deepening into","Great Expectations"
"black; and there was the solitary flat marsh; and far away there were","Great Expectations"
"the rising grounds, between which and us there seemed to be no life,","Great Expectations"
"save here and there in the foreground a melancholy gull.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As the night was fast falling, and as the moon, being past the full,","Great Expectations"
"would not rise early, we held a little council; a short one, for","Great Expectations"
"clearly our course was to lie by at the first lonely tavern we could","Great Expectations"
"find. So, they plied their oars once more, and I looked out for","Great Expectations"
"anything like a house. Thus we held on, speaking little, for four or","Great Expectations"
"five dull miles. It was very cold, and, a collier coming by us, with","Great Expectations"
"her galley-fire smoking and flaring, looked like a comfortable home.","Great Expectations"
"The night was as dark by this time as it would be until morning; and","Great Expectations"
"what light we had, seemed to come more from the river than the sky, as","Great Expectations"
"the oars in their dipping struck at a few reflected stars.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"At this dismal time we were evidently all possessed by the idea that we","Great Expectations"
"were followed. As the tide made, it flapped heavily at irregular","Great Expectations"
"intervals against the shore; and whenever such a sound came, one or","Great Expectations"
"other of us was sure to start, and look in that direction. Here and","Great Expectations"
"there, the set of the current had worn down the bank into a little","Great Expectations"
"creek, and we were all suspicious of such places, and eyed them","Great Expectations"
"nervously. Sometimes, “What was that ripple?” one of us would say in a","Great Expectations"
"low voice. Or another, “Is that a boat yonder?” And afterwards we would","Great Expectations"
"fall into a dead silence, and I would sit impatiently thinking with","Great Expectations"
"what an unusual amount of noise the oars worked in the thowels.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"At length we descried a light and a roof, and presently afterwards ran","Great Expectations"
"alongside a little causeway made of stones that had been picked up hard","Great Expectations"
"by. Leaving the rest in the boat, I stepped ashore, and found the light","Great Expectations"
"to be in a window of a public-house. It was a dirty place enough, and I","Great Expectations"
"dare say not unknown to smuggling adventurers; but there was a good","Great Expectations"
"fire in the kitchen, and there were eggs and bacon to eat, and various","Great Expectations"
"liquors to drink. Also, there were two double-bedded rooms,—“such as","Great Expectations"
"they were,” the landlord said. No other company was in the house than","Great Expectations"
"the landlord, his wife, and a grizzled male creature, the “Jack” of the","Great Expectations"
"little causeway, who was as slimy and smeary as if he had been","Great Expectations"
"low-water mark too.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"With this assistant, I went down to the boat again, and we all came","Great Expectations"
"ashore, and brought out the oars, and rudder and boat-hook, and all","Great Expectations"
"else, and hauled her up for the night. We made a very good meal by the","Great Expectations"
"kitchen fire, and then apportioned the bedrooms: Herbert and Startop","Great Expectations"
"were to occupy one; I and our charge the other. We found the air as","Great Expectations"
"carefully excluded from both, as if air were fatal to life; and there","Great Expectations"
"were more dirty clothes and bandboxes under the beds than I should have","Great Expectations"
"thought the family possessed. But we considered ourselves well off,","Great Expectations"
"notwithstanding, for a more solitary place we could not have found.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"While we were comforting ourselves by the fire after our meal, the","Great Expectations"
"Jack—who was sitting in a corner, and who had a bloated pair of shoes","Great Expectations"
"on, which he had exhibited while we were eating our eggs and bacon, as","Great Expectations"
"interesting relics that he had taken a few days ago from the feet of a","Great Expectations"
"drowned seaman washed ashore—asked me if we had seen a four-oared","Great Expectations"
"galley going up with the tide? When I told him No, he said she must","Great Expectations"
"have gone down then, and yet she “took up too,” when she left there.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“They must ha’ thought better on’t for some reason or another,” said","Great Expectations"
"the Jack, “and gone down.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“A four-oared galley, did you say?” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“A four,” said the Jack, “and two sitters.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Did they come ashore here?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“They put in with a stone two-gallon jar for some beer. I’d ha’ been","Great Expectations"
"glad to pison the beer myself,” said the Jack, “or put some rattling","Great Expectations"
"physic in it.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Why?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“_I_ know why,” said the Jack. He spoke in a slushy voice, as if much","Great Expectations"
"mud had washed into his throat.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“He thinks,” said the landlord, a weakly meditative man with a pale","Great Expectations"
"eye, who seemed to rely greatly on his Jack,—“he thinks they was, what","Great Expectations"
"they wasn’t.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“_I_ knows what I thinks,” observed the Jack.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“_You_ thinks Custom ’Us, Jack?” said the landlord.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I do,” said the Jack.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Then you’re wrong, Jack.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“AM I!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"In the infinite meaning of his reply and his boundless confidence in","Great Expectations"
"his views, the Jack took one of his bloated shoes off, looked into it,","Great Expectations"
"knocked a few stones out of it on the kitchen floor, and put it on","Great Expectations"
"again. He did this with the air of a Jack who was so right that he","Great Expectations"
"could afford to do anything.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Why, what do you make out that they done with their buttons then,","Great Expectations"
"Jack?” asked the landlord, vacillating weakly.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Done with their buttons?” returned the Jack. “Chucked ’em overboard.","Great Expectations"
"Swallered ’em. Sowed ’em, to come up small salad. Done with their","Great Expectations"
"buttons!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Don’t be cheeky, Jack,” remonstrated the landlord, in a melancholy and","Great Expectations"
"pathetic way.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“A Custom ’Us officer knows what to do with his Buttons,” said the","Great Expectations"
"Jack, repeating the obnoxious word with the greatest contempt, “when","Great Expectations"
"they comes betwixt him and his own light. A four and two sitters don’t","Great Expectations"
"go hanging and hovering, up with one tide and down with another, and","Great Expectations"
"both with and against another, without there being Custom ’Us at the","Great Expectations"
"bottom of it.” Saying which he went out in disdain; and the landlord,","Great Expectations"
"having no one to reply upon, found it impracticable to pursue the","Great Expectations"
"subject.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"This dialogue made us all uneasy, and me very uneasy. The dismal wind","Great Expectations"
"was muttering round the house, the tide was flapping at the shore, and","Great Expectations"
"I had a feeling that we were caged and threatened. A four-oared galley","Great Expectations"
"hovering about in so unusual a way as to attract this notice was an","Great Expectations"
"ugly circumstance that I could not get rid of. When I had induced","Great Expectations"
"Provis to go up to bed, I went outside with my two companions (Startop","Great Expectations"
"by this time knew the state of the case), and held another council.","Great Expectations"
"Whether we should remain at the house until near the steamer’s time,","Great Expectations"
"which would be about one in the afternoon, or whether we should put off","Great Expectations"
"early in the morning, was the question we discussed. On the whole we","Great Expectations"
"deemed it the better course to lie where we were, until within an hour","Great Expectations"
"or so of the steamer’s time, and then to get out in her track, and","Great Expectations"
"drift easily with the tide. Having settled to do this, we returned into","Great Expectations"
"the house and went to bed.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I lay down with the greater part of my clothes on, and slept well for a","Great Expectations"
"few hours. When I awoke, the wind had risen, and the sign of the house","Great Expectations"
"(the Ship) was creaking and banging about, with noises that startled","Great Expectations"
"me. Rising softly, for my charge lay fast asleep, I looked out of the","Great Expectations"
"window. It commanded the causeway where we had hauled up our boat, and,","Great Expectations"
"as my eyes adapted themselves to the light of the clouded moon, I saw","Great Expectations"
"two men looking into her. They passed by under the window, looking at","Great Expectations"
"nothing else, and they did not go down to the landing-place which I","Great Expectations"
"could discern to be empty, but struck across the marsh in the direction","Great Expectations"
"of the Nore.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"My first impulse was to call up Herbert, and show him the two men going","Great Expectations"
"away. But reflecting, before I got into his room, which was at the back","Great Expectations"
"of the house and adjoined mine, that he and Startop had had a harder","Great Expectations"
"day than I, and were fatigued, I forbore. Going back to my window, I","Great Expectations"
"could see the two men moving over the marsh. In that light, however, I","Great Expectations"
"soon lost them, and, feeling very cold, lay down to think of the","Great Expectations"
"matter, and fell asleep again.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We were up early. As we walked to and fro, all four together, before","Great Expectations"
"breakfast, I deemed it right to recount what I had seen. Again our","Great Expectations"
"charge was the least anxious of the party. It was very likely that the","Great Expectations"
"men belonged to the Custom House, he said quietly, and that they had no","Great Expectations"
"thought of us. I tried to persuade myself that it was so,—as, indeed,","Great Expectations"
"it might easily be. However, I proposed that he and I should walk away","Great Expectations"
"together to a distant point we could see, and that the boat should take","Great Expectations"
"us aboard there, or as near there as might prove feasible, at about","Great Expectations"
"noon. This being considered a good precaution, soon after breakfast he","Great Expectations"
"and I set forth, without saying anything at the tavern.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He smoked his pipe as we went along, and sometimes stopped to clap me","Great Expectations"
"on the shoulder. One would have supposed that it was I who was in","Great Expectations"
"danger, not he, and that he was reassuring me. We spoke very little. As","Great Expectations"
"we approached the point, I begged him to remain in a sheltered place,","Great Expectations"
"while I went on to reconnoitre; for it was towards it that the men had","Great Expectations"
"passed in the night. He complied, and I went on alone. There was no","Great Expectations"
"boat off the point, nor any boat drawn up anywhere near it, nor were","Great Expectations"
"there any signs of the men having embarked there. But, to be sure, the","Great Expectations"
"tide was high, and there might have been some footprints under water.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"When he looked out from his shelter in the distance, and saw that I","Great Expectations"
"waved my hat to him to come up, he rejoined me, and there we waited;","Great Expectations"
"sometimes lying on the bank, wrapped in our coats, and sometimes moving","Great Expectations"
"about to warm ourselves, until we saw our boat coming round. We got","Great Expectations"
"aboard easily, and rowed out into the track of the steamer. By that","Great Expectations"
"time it wanted but ten minutes of one o’clock, and we began to look out","Great Expectations"
"for her smoke.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"But, it was half-past one before we saw her smoke, and soon afterwards","Great Expectations"
"we saw behind it the smoke of another steamer. As they were coming on","Great Expectations"
"at full speed, we got the two bags ready, and took that opportunity of","Great Expectations"
"saying good-bye to Herbert and Startop. We had all shaken hands","Great Expectations"
"cordially, and neither Herbert’s eyes nor mine were quite dry, when I","Great Expectations"
"saw a four-oared galley shoot out from under the bank but a little way","Great Expectations"
"ahead of us, and row out into the same track.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"A stretch of shore had been as yet between us and the steamer’s smoke,","Great Expectations"
"by reason of the bend and wind of the river; but now she was visible,","Great Expectations"
"coming head on. I called to Herbert and Startop to keep before the","Great Expectations"
"tide, that she might see us lying by for her, and I adjured Provis to","Great Expectations"
"sit quite still, wrapped in his cloak. He answered cheerily, “Trust to","Great Expectations"
"me, dear boy,” and sat like a statue. Meantime the galley, which was","Great Expectations"
"very skilfully handled, had crossed us, let us come up with her, and","Great Expectations"
"fallen alongside. Leaving just room enough for the play of the oars,","Great Expectations"
"she kept alongside, drifting when we drifted, and pulling a stroke or","Great Expectations"
"two when we pulled. Of the two sitters one held the rudder-lines, and","Great Expectations"
"looked at us attentively,—as did all the rowers; the other sitter was","Great Expectations"
"wrapped up, much as Provis was, and seemed to shrink, and whisper some","Great Expectations"
"instruction to the steerer as he looked at us. Not a word was spoken in","Great Expectations"
"either boat.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Startop could make out, after a few minutes, which steamer was first,","Great Expectations"
"and gave me the word “Hamburg,” in a low voice, as we sat face to face.","Great Expectations"
"She was nearing us very fast, and the beating of her peddles grew","Great Expectations"
"louder and louder. I felt as if her shadow were absolutely upon us,","Great Expectations"
"when the galley hailed us. I answered.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You have a returned Transport there,” said the man who held the lines.","Great Expectations"
"“That’s the man, wrapped in the cloak. His name is Abel Magwitch,","Great Expectations"
"otherwise Provis. I apprehend that man, and call upon him to surrender,","Great Expectations"
"and you to assist.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"At the same moment, without giving any audible direction to his crew,","Great Expectations"
"he ran the galley abroad of us. They had pulled one sudden stroke","Great Expectations"
"ahead, had got their oars in, had run athwart us, and were holding on","Great Expectations"
"to our gunwale, before we knew what they were doing. This caused great","Great Expectations"
"confusion on board the steamer, and I heard them calling to us, and","Great Expectations"
"heard the order given to stop the paddles, and heard them stop, but","Great Expectations"
"felt her driving down upon us irresistibly. In the same moment, I saw","Great Expectations"
"the steersman of the galley lay his hand on his prisoner’s shoulder,","Great Expectations"
"and saw that both boats were swinging round with the force of the tide,","Great Expectations"
"and saw that all hands on board the steamer were running forward quite","Great Expectations"
"frantically. Still, in the same moment, I saw the prisoner start up,","Great Expectations"
"lean across his captor, and pull the cloak from the neck of the","Great Expectations"
"shrinking sitter in the galley. Still in the same moment, I saw that","Great Expectations"
"the face disclosed, was the face of the other convict of long ago.","Great Expectations"
"Still, in the same moment, I saw the face tilt backward with a white","Great Expectations"
"terror on it that I shall never forget, and heard a great cry on board","Great Expectations"
"the steamer, and a loud splash in the water, and felt the boat sink","Great Expectations"
"from under me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was but for an instant that I seemed to struggle with a thousand","Great Expectations"
"mill-weirs and a thousand flashes of light; that instant past, I was","Great Expectations"
"taken on board the galley. Herbert was there, and Startop was there;","Great Expectations"
"but our boat was gone, and the two convicts were gone.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"What with the cries aboard the steamer, and the furious blowing off of","Great Expectations"
"her steam, and her driving on, and our driving on, I could not at first","Great Expectations"
"distinguish sky from water or shore from shore; but the crew of the","Great Expectations"
"galley righted her with great speed, and, pulling certain swift strong","Great Expectations"
"strokes ahead, lay upon their oars, every man looking silently and","Great Expectations"
"eagerly at the water astern. Presently a dark object was seen in it,","Great Expectations"
"bearing towards us on the tide. No man spoke, but the steersman held up","Great Expectations"
"his hand, and all softly backed water, and kept the boat straight and","Great Expectations"
"true before it. As it came nearer, I saw it to be Magwitch, swimming,","Great Expectations"
"but not swimming freely. He was taken on board, and instantly manacled","Great Expectations"
"at the wrists and ankles.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The galley was kept steady, and the silent, eager look-out at the water","Great Expectations"
"was resumed. But, the Rotterdam steamer now came up, and apparently not","Great Expectations"
"understanding what had happened, came on at speed. By the time she had","Great Expectations"
"been hailed and stopped, both steamers were drifting away from us, and","Great Expectations"
"we were rising and falling in a troubled wake of water. The look-out","Great Expectations"
"was kept, long after all was still again and the two steamers were","Great Expectations"
"gone; but everybody knew that it was hopeless now.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"At length we gave it up, and pulled under the shore towards the tavern","Great Expectations"
"we had lately left, where we were received with no little surprise.","Great Expectations"
"Here I was able to get some comforts for Magwitch,—Provis no","Great Expectations"
"longer,—who had received some very severe injury in the chest, and a","Great Expectations"
"deep cut in the head.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He told me that he believed himself to have gone under the keel of the","Great Expectations"
"steamer, and to have been struck on the head in rising. The injury to","Great Expectations"
"his chest (which rendered his breathing extremely painful) he thought","Great Expectations"
"he had received against the side of the galley. He added that he did","Great Expectations"
"not pretend to say what he might or might not have done to Compeyson,","Great Expectations"
"but that, in the moment of his laying his hand on his cloak to identify","Great Expectations"
"him, that villain had staggered up and staggered back, and they had","Great Expectations"
"both gone overboard together, when the sudden wrenching of him","Great Expectations"
"(Magwitch) out of our boat, and the endeavour of his captor to keep him","Great Expectations"
"in it, had capsized us. He told me in a whisper that they had gone down","Great Expectations"
"fiercely locked in each other’s arms, and that there had been a","Great Expectations"
"struggle under water, and that he had disengaged himself, struck out,","Great Expectations"
"and swum away.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I never had any reason to doubt the exact truth of what he thus told","Great Expectations"
"me. The officer who steered the galley gave the same account of their","Great Expectations"
"going overboard.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"When I asked this officer’s permission to change the prisoner’s wet","Great Expectations"
"clothes by purchasing any spare garments I could get at the","Great Expectations"
"public-house, he gave it readily: merely observing that he must take","Great Expectations"
"charge of everything his prisoner had about him. So the pocket-book","Great Expectations"
"which had once been in my hands passed into the officer’s. He further","Great Expectations"
"gave me leave to accompany the prisoner to London; but declined to","Great Expectations"
"accord that grace to my two friends.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The Jack at the Ship was instructed where the drowned man had gone","Great Expectations"
"down, and undertook to search for the body in the places where it was","Great Expectations"
"likeliest to come ashore. His interest in its recovery seemed to me to","Great Expectations"
"be much heightened when he heard that it had stockings on. Probably, it","Great Expectations"
"took about a dozen drowned men to fit him out completely; and that may","Great Expectations"
"have been the reason why the different articles of his dress were in","Great Expectations"
"various stages of decay.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We remained at the public-house until the tide turned, and then","Great Expectations"
"Magwitch was carried down to the galley and put on board. Herbert and","Great Expectations"
"Startop were to get to London by land, as soon as they could. We had a","Great Expectations"
"doleful parting, and when I took my place by Magwitch’s side, I felt","Great Expectations"
"that that was my place henceforth while he lived.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"For now, my repugnance to him had all melted away; and in the hunted,","Great Expectations"
"wounded, shackled creature who held my hand in his, I only saw a man","Great Expectations"
"who had meant to be my benefactor, and who had felt affectionately,","Great Expectations"
"gratefully, and generously, towards me with great constancy through a","Great Expectations"
"series of years. I only saw in him a much better man than I had been to","Great Expectations"
"Joe.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"His breathing became more difficult and painful as the night drew on,","Great Expectations"
"and often he could not repress a groan. I tried to rest him on the arm","Great Expectations"
"I could use, in any easy position; but it was dreadful to think that I","Great Expectations"
"could not be sorry at heart for his being badly hurt, since it was","Great Expectations"
"unquestionably best that he should die. That there were, still living,","Great Expectations"
"people enough who were able and willing to identify him, I could not","Great Expectations"
"doubt. That he would be leniently treated, I could not hope. He who had","Great Expectations"
"been presented in the worst light at his trial, who had since broken","Great Expectations"
"prison and had been tried again, who had returned from transportation","Great Expectations"
"under a life sentence, and who had occasioned the death of the man who","Great Expectations"
"was the cause of his arrest.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As we returned towards the setting sun we had yesterday left behind us,","Great Expectations"
"and as the stream of our hopes seemed all running back, I told him how","Great Expectations"
"grieved I was to think that he had come home for my sake.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Dear boy,” he answered, “I’m quite content to take my chance. I’ve","Great Expectations"
"seen my boy, and he can be a gentleman without me.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"No. I had thought about that, while we had been there side by side. No.","Great Expectations"
"Apart from any inclinations of my own, I understood Wemmick’s hint now.","Great Expectations"
"I foresaw that, being convicted, his possessions would be forfeited to","Great Expectations"
"the Crown.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Lookee here, dear boy,” said he “It’s best as a gentleman should not","Great Expectations"
"be knowed to belong to me now. Only come to see me as if you come by","Great Expectations"
"chance alonger Wemmick. Sit where I can see you when I am swore to, for","Great Expectations"
"the last o’ many times, and I don’t ask no more.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I will never stir from your side,” said I, “when I am suffered to be","Great Expectations"
"near you. Please God, I will be as true to you as you have been to me!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I felt his hand tremble as it held mine, and he turned his face away as","Great Expectations"
"he lay in the bottom of the boat, and I heard that old sound in his","Great Expectations"
"throat,—softened now, like all the rest of him. It was a good thing","Great Expectations"
"that he had touched this point, for it put into my mind what I might","Great Expectations"
"not otherwise have thought of until too late,—that he need never know","Great Expectations"
"how his hopes of enriching me had perished.","Great Expectations"

"Chapter LV.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He was taken to the Police Court next day, and would have been","Great Expectations"
"immediately committed for trial, but that it was necessary to send down","Great Expectations"
"for an old officer of the prison-ship from which he had once escaped,","Great Expectations"
"to speak to his identity. Nobody doubted it; but Compeyson, who had","Great Expectations"
"meant to depose to it, was tumbling on the tides, dead, and it happened","Great Expectations"
"that there was not at that time any prison officer in London who could","Great Expectations"
"give the required evidence. I had gone direct to Mr. Jaggers at his","Great Expectations"
"private house, on my arrival over night, to retain his assistance, and","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Jaggers on the prisoner’s behalf would admit nothing. It was the","Great Expectations"
"sole resource; for he told me that the case must be over in five","Great Expectations"
"minutes when the witness was there, and that no power on earth could","Great Expectations"
"prevent its going against us.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I imparted to Mr. Jaggers my design of keeping him in ignorance of the","Great Expectations"
"fate of his wealth. Mr. Jaggers was querulous and angry with me for","Great Expectations"
"having “let it slip through my fingers,” and said we must memorialise","Great Expectations"
"by and by, and try at all events for some of it. But he did not conceal","Great Expectations"
"from me that, although there might be many cases in which the","Great Expectations"
"forfeiture would not be exacted, there were no circumstances in this","Great Expectations"
"case to make it one of them. I understood that very well. I was not","Great Expectations"
"related to the outlaw, or connected with him by any recognisable tie;","Great Expectations"
"he had put his hand to no writing or settlement in my favour before his","Great Expectations"
"apprehension, and to do so now would be idle. I had no claim, and I","Great Expectations"
"finally resolved, and ever afterwards abided by the resolution, that my","Great Expectations"
"heart should never be sickened with the hopeless task of attempting to","Great Expectations"
"establish one.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"There appeared to be reason for supposing that the drowned informer had","Great Expectations"
"hoped for a reward out of this forfeiture, and had obtained some","Great Expectations"
"accurate knowledge of Magwitch’s affairs. When his body was found, many","Great Expectations"
"miles from the scene of his death, and so horribly disfigured that he","Great Expectations"
"was only recognisable by the contents of his pockets, notes were still","Great Expectations"
"legible, folded in a case he carried. Among these were the name of a","Great Expectations"
"banking-house in New South Wales, where a sum of money was, and the","Great Expectations"
"designation of certain lands of considerable value. Both these heads of","Great Expectations"
"information were in a list that Magwitch, while in prison, gave to Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Jaggers, of the possessions he supposed I should inherit. His","Great Expectations"
"ignorance, poor fellow, at last served him; he never mistrusted but","Great Expectations"
"that my inheritance was quite safe, with Mr. Jaggers’s aid.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"After three days’ delay, during which the crown prosecution stood over","Great Expectations"
"for the production of the witness from the prison-ship, the witness","Great Expectations"
"came, and completed the easy case. He was committed to take his trial","Great Expectations"
"at the next Sessions, which would come on in a month.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was at this dark time of my life that Herbert returned home one","Great Expectations"
"evening, a good deal cast down, and said,—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“My dear Handel, I fear I shall soon have to leave you.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"His partner having prepared me for that, I was less surprised than he","Great Expectations"
"thought.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“We shall lose a fine opportunity if I put off going to Cairo, and I am","Great Expectations"
"very much afraid I must go, Handel, when you most need me.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Herbert, I shall always need you, because I shall always love you; but","Great Expectations"
"my need is no greater now than at another time.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You will be so lonely.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I have not leisure to think of that,” said I. “You know that I am","Great Expectations"
"always with him to the full extent of the time allowed, and that I","Great Expectations"
"should be with him all day long, if I could. And when I come away from","Great Expectations"
"him, you know that my thoughts are with him.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The dreadful condition to which he was brought, was so appalling to","Great Expectations"
"both of us, that we could not refer to it in plainer words.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“My dear fellow,” said Herbert, “let the near prospect of our","Great Expectations"
"separation—for, it is very near—be my justification for troubling you","Great Expectations"
"about yourself. Have you thought of your future?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No, for I have been afraid to think of any future.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“But yours cannot be dismissed; indeed, my dear dear Handel, it must","Great Expectations"
"not be dismissed. I wish you would enter on it now, as far as a few","Great Expectations"
"friendly words go, with me.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I will,” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“In this branch house of ours, Handel, we must have a—”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I saw that his delicacy was avoiding the right word, so I said, “A","Great Expectations"
"clerk.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“A clerk. And I hope it is not at all unlikely that he may expand (as a","Great Expectations"
"clerk of your acquaintance has expanded) into a partner. Now,","Great Expectations"
"Handel,—in short, my dear boy, will you come to me?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"There was something charmingly cordial and engaging in the manner in","Great Expectations"
"which after saying “Now, Handel,” as if it were the grave beginning of","Great Expectations"
"a portentous business exordium, he had suddenly given up that tone,","Great Expectations"
"stretched out his honest hand, and spoken like a schoolboy.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Clara and I have talked about it again and again,” Herbert pursued,","Great Expectations"
"“and the dear little thing begged me only this evening, with tears in","Great Expectations"
"her eyes, to say to you that, if you will live with us when we come","Great Expectations"
"together, she will do her best to make you happy, and to convince her","Great Expectations"
"husband’s friend that he is her friend too. We should get on so well,","Great Expectations"
"Handel!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I thanked her heartily, and I thanked him heartily, but said I could","Great Expectations"
"not yet make sure of joining him as he so kindly offered. Firstly, my","Great Expectations"
"mind was too preoccupied to be able to take in the subject clearly.","Great Expectations"
"Secondly,—Yes! Secondly, there was a vague something lingering in my","Great Expectations"
"thoughts that will come out very near the end of this slight narrative.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“But if you thought, Herbert, that you could, without doing any injury","Great Expectations"
"to your business, leave the question open for a little while—”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“For any while,” cried Herbert. “Six months, a year!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Not so long as that,” said I. “Two or three months at most.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Herbert was highly delighted when we shook hands on this arrangement,","Great Expectations"
"and said he could now take courage to tell me that he believed he must","Great Expectations"
"go away at the end of the week.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And Clara?” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“The dear little thing,” returned Herbert, “holds dutifully to her","Great Expectations"
"father as long as he lasts; but he won’t last long. Mrs. Whimple","Great Expectations"
"confides to me that he is certainly going.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Not to say an unfeeling thing,” said I, “he cannot do better than go.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I am afraid that must be admitted,” said Herbert; “and then I shall","Great Expectations"
"come back for the dear little thing, and the dear little thing and I","Great Expectations"
"will walk quietly into the nearest church. Remember! The blessed","Great Expectations"
"darling comes of no family, my dear Handel, and never looked into the","Great Expectations"
"red book, and hasn’t a notion about her grandpapa. What a fortune for","Great Expectations"
"the son of my mother!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"On the Saturday in that same week, I took my leave of Herbert,—full of","Great Expectations"
"bright hope, but sad and sorry to leave me,—as he sat on one of the","Great Expectations"
"seaport mail coaches. I went into a coffee-house to write a little note","Great Expectations"
"to Clara, telling her he had gone off, sending his love to her over and","Great Expectations"
"over again, and then went to my lonely home,—if it deserved the name;","Great Expectations"
"for it was now no home to me, and I had no home anywhere.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"On the stairs I encountered Wemmick, who was coming down, after an","Great Expectations"
"unsuccessful application of his knuckles to my door. I had not seen him","Great Expectations"
"alone since the disastrous issue of the attempted flight; and he had","Great Expectations"
"come, in his private and personal capacity, to say a few words of","Great Expectations"
"explanation in reference to that failure.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“The late Compeyson,” said Wemmick, “had by little and little got at","Great Expectations"
"the bottom of half of the regular business now transacted; and it was","Great Expectations"
"from the talk of some of his people in trouble (some of his people","Great Expectations"
"being always in trouble) that I heard what I did. I kept my ears open,","Great Expectations"
"seeming to have them shut, until I heard that he was absent, and I","Great Expectations"
"thought that would be the best time for making the attempt. I can only","Great Expectations"
"suppose now, that it was a part of his policy, as a very clever man,","Great Expectations"
"habitually to deceive his own instruments. You don’t blame me, I hope,","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Pip? I am sure I tried to serve you, with all my heart.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I am as sure of that, Wemmick, as you can be, and I thank you most","Great Expectations"
"earnestly for all your interest and friendship.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Thank you, thank you very much. It’s a bad job,” said Wemmick,","Great Expectations"
"scratching his head, “and I assure you I haven’t been so cut up for a","Great Expectations"
"long time. What I look at is the sacrifice of so much portable","Great Expectations"
"property. Dear me!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What _I_ think of, Wemmick, is the poor owner of the property.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, to be sure,” said Wemmick. “Of course, there can be no objection","Great Expectations"
"to your being sorry for him, and I’d put down a five-pound note myself","Great Expectations"
"to get him out of it. But what I look at is this. The late Compeyson","Great Expectations"
"having been beforehand with him in intelligence of his return, and","Great Expectations"
"being so determined to bring him to book, I do not think he could have","Great Expectations"
"been saved. Whereas, the portable property certainly could have been","Great Expectations"
"saved. That’s the difference between the property and the owner, don’t","Great Expectations"
"you see?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I invited Wemmick to come upstairs, and refresh himself with a glass of","Great Expectations"
"grog before walking to Walworth. He accepted the invitation. While he","Great Expectations"
"was drinking his moderate allowance, he said, with nothing to lead up","Great Expectations"
"to it, and after having appeared rather fidgety,—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What do you think of my meaning to take a holiday on Monday, Mr. Pip?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Why, I suppose you have not done such a thing these twelve months.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“These twelve years, more likely,” said Wemmick. “Yes. I’m going to","Great Expectations"
"take a holiday. More than that; I’m going to take a walk. More than","Great Expectations"
"that; I’m going to ask you to take a walk with me.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I was about to excuse myself, as being but a bad companion just then,","Great Expectations"
"when Wemmick anticipated me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I know your engagements,” said he, “and I know you are out of sorts,","Great Expectations"
"Mr. Pip. But if you _could_ oblige me, I should take it as a kindness.","Great Expectations"
"It ain’t a long walk, and it’s an early one. Say it might occupy you","Great Expectations"
"(including breakfast on the walk) from eight to twelve. Couldn’t you","Great Expectations"
"stretch a point and manage it?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He had done so much for me at various times, that this was very little","Great Expectations"
"to do for him. I said I could manage it,—would manage it,—and he was so","Great Expectations"
"very much pleased by my acquiescence, that I was pleased too. At his","Great Expectations"
"particular request, I appointed to call for him at the Castle at half","Great Expectations"
"past eight on Monday morning, and so we parted for the time.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Punctual to my appointment, I rang at the Castle gate on the Monday","Great Expectations"
"morning, and was received by Wemmick himself, who struck me as looking","Great Expectations"
"tighter than usual, and having a sleeker hat on. Within, there were two","Great Expectations"
"glasses of rum and milk prepared, and two biscuits. The Aged must have","Great Expectations"
"been stirring with the lark, for, glancing into the perspective of his","Great Expectations"
"bedroom, I observed that his bed was empty.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"When we had fortified ourselves with the rum and milk and biscuits, and","Great Expectations"
"were going out for the walk with that training preparation on us, I was","Great Expectations"
"considerably surprised to see Wemmick take up a fishing-rod, and put it","Great Expectations"
"over his shoulder. “Why, we are not going fishing!” said I. “No,”","Great Expectations"
"returned Wemmick, “but I like to walk with one.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I thought this odd; however, I said nothing, and we set off. We went","Great Expectations"
"towards Camberwell Green, and when we were thereabouts, Wemmick said","Great Expectations"
"suddenly,—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Halloa! Here’s a church!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"There was nothing very surprising in that; but again, I was rather","Great Expectations"
"surprised, when he said, as if he were animated by a brilliant idea,—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Let’s go in!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We went in, Wemmick leaving his fishing-rod in the porch, and looked","Great Expectations"
"all round. In the mean time, Wemmick was diving into his coat-pockets,","Great Expectations"
"and getting something out of paper there.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Halloa!” said he. “Here’s a couple of pair of gloves! Let’s put ’em","Great Expectations"
"on!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As the gloves were white kid gloves, and as the post-office was widened","Great Expectations"
"to its utmost extent, I now began to have my strong suspicions. They","Great Expectations"
"were strengthened into certainty when I beheld the Aged enter at a side","Great Expectations"
"door, escorting a lady.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Halloa!” said Wemmick. “Here’s Miss Skiffins! Let’s have a wedding.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"That discreet damsel was attired as usual, except that she was now","Great Expectations"
"engaged in substituting for her green kid gloves a pair of white. The","Great Expectations"
"Aged was likewise occupied in preparing a similar sacrifice for the","Great Expectations"
"altar of Hymen. The old gentleman, however, experienced so much","Great Expectations"
"difficulty in getting his gloves on, that Wemmick found it necessary to","Great Expectations"
"put him with his back against a pillar, and then to get behind the","Great Expectations"
"pillar himself and pull away at them, while I for my part held the old","Great Expectations"
"gentleman round the waist, that he might present an equal and safe","Great Expectations"
"resistance. By dint of this ingenious scheme, his gloves were got on to","Great Expectations"
"perfection.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The clerk and clergyman then appearing, we were ranged in order at","Great Expectations"
"those fatal rails. True to his notion of seeming to do it all without","Great Expectations"
"preparation, I heard Wemmick say to himself, as he took something out","Great Expectations"
"of his waistcoat-pocket before the service began, “Halloa! Here’s a","Great Expectations"
"ring!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I acted in the capacity of backer, or best-man, to the bridegroom;","Great Expectations"
"while a little limp pew-opener in a soft bonnet like a baby’s, made a","Great Expectations"
"feint of being the bosom friend of Miss Skiffins. The responsibility of","Great Expectations"
"giving the lady away devolved upon the Aged, which led to the","Great Expectations"
"clergyman’s being unintentionally scandalised, and it happened thus.","Great Expectations"
"When he said, “Who giveth this woman to be married to this man?” the","Great Expectations"
"old gentleman, not in the least knowing what point of the ceremony we","Great Expectations"
"had arrived at, stood most amiably beaming at the ten commandments.","Great Expectations"
"Upon which, the clergyman said again, “WHO giveth this woman to be","Great Expectations"
"married to this man?” The old gentleman being still in a state of most","Great Expectations"
"estimable unconsciousness, the bridegroom cried out in his accustomed","Great Expectations"
"voice, “Now Aged P. you know; who giveth?” To which the Aged replied","Great Expectations"
"with great briskness, before saying that _he_ gave, “All right, John,","Great Expectations"
"all right, my boy!” And the clergyman came to so gloomy a pause upon","Great Expectations"
"it, that I had doubts for the moment whether we should get completely","Great Expectations"
"married that day.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was completely done, however, and when we were going out of church","Great Expectations"
"Wemmick took the cover off the font, and put his white gloves in it,","Great Expectations"
"and put the cover on again. Mrs. Wemmick, more heedful of the future,","Great Expectations"
"put her white gloves in her pocket and assumed her green. “_Now_, Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Pip,” said Wemmick, triumphantly shouldering the fishing-rod as we came","Great Expectations"
"out, “let me ask you whether anybody would suppose this to be a","Great Expectations"
"wedding-party!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Breakfast had been ordered at a pleasant little tavern, a mile or so","Great Expectations"
"away upon the rising ground beyond the green; and there was a bagatelle","Great Expectations"
"board in the room, in case we should desire to unbend our minds after","Great Expectations"
"the solemnity. It was pleasant to observe that Mrs. Wemmick no longer","Great Expectations"
"unwound Wemmick’s arm when it adapted itself to her figure, but sat in","Great Expectations"
"a high-backed chair against the wall, like a violoncello in its case,","Great Expectations"
"and submitted to be embraced as that melodious instrument might have","Great Expectations"
"done.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We had an excellent breakfast, and when any one declined anything on","Great Expectations"
"table, Wemmick said, “Provided by contract, you know; don’t be afraid","Great Expectations"
"of it!” I drank to the new couple, drank to the Aged, drank to the","Great Expectations"
"Castle, saluted the bride at parting, and made myself as agreeable as I","Great Expectations"
"could.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Wemmick came down to the door with me, and I again shook hands with","Great Expectations"
"him, and wished him joy.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Thankee!” said Wemmick, rubbing his hands. “She’s such a manager of","Great Expectations"
"fowls, you have no idea. You shall have some eggs, and judge for","Great Expectations"
"yourself. I say, Mr. Pip!” calling me back, and speaking low. “This is","Great Expectations"
"altogether a Walworth sentiment, please.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I understand. Not to be mentioned in Little Britain,” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Wemmick nodded. “After what you let out the other day, Mr. Jaggers may","Great Expectations"
"as well not know of it. He might think my brain was softening, or","Great Expectations"
"something of the kind.”","Great Expectations"

"Chapter LVI.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He lay in prison very ill, during the whole interval between his","Great Expectations"
"committal for trial and the coming round of the Sessions. He had broken","Great Expectations"
"two ribs, they had wounded one of his lungs, and he breathed with great","Great Expectations"
"pain and difficulty, which increased daily. It was a consequence of his","Great Expectations"
"hurt that he spoke so low as to be scarcely audible; therefore he spoke","Great Expectations"
"very little. But he was ever ready to listen to me; and it became the","Great Expectations"
"first duty of my life to say to him, and read to him, what I knew he","Great Expectations"
"ought to hear.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Being far too ill to remain in the common prison, he was removed, after","Great Expectations"
"the first day or so, into the infirmary. This gave me opportunities of","Great Expectations"
"being with him that I could not otherwise have had. And but for his","Great Expectations"
"illness he would have been put in irons, for he was regarded as a","Great Expectations"
"determined prison-breaker, and I know not what else.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Although I saw him every day, it was for only a short time; hence, the","Great Expectations"
"regularly recurring spaces of our separation were long enough to record","Great Expectations"
"on his face any slight changes that occurred in his physical state. I","Great Expectations"
"do not recollect that I once saw any change in it for the better; he","Great Expectations"
"wasted, and became slowly weaker and worse, day by day, from the day","Great Expectations"
"when the prison door closed upon him.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The kind of submission or resignation that he showed was that of a man","Great Expectations"
"who was tired out. I sometimes derived an impression, from his manner","Great Expectations"
"or from a whispered word or two which escaped him, that he pondered","Great Expectations"
"over the question whether he might have been a better man under better","Great Expectations"
"circumstances. But he never justified himself by a hint tending that","Great Expectations"
"way, or tried to bend the past out of its eternal shape.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It happened on two or three occasions in my presence, that his","Great Expectations"
"desperate reputation was alluded to by one or other of the people in","Great Expectations"
"attendance on him. A smile crossed his face then, and he turned his","Great Expectations"
"eyes on me with a trustful look, as if he were confident that I had","Great Expectations"
"seen some small redeeming touch in him, even so long ago as when I was","Great Expectations"
"a little child. As to all the rest, he was humble and contrite, and I","Great Expectations"
"never knew him complain.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"When the Sessions came round, Mr. Jaggers caused an application to be","Great Expectations"
"made for the postponement of his trial until the following Sessions. It","Great Expectations"
"was obviously made with the assurance that he could not live so long,","Great Expectations"
"and was refused. The trial came on at once, and, when he was put to the","Great Expectations"
"bar, he was seated in a chair. No objection was made to my getting","Great Expectations"
"close to the dock, on the outside of it, and holding the hand that he","Great Expectations"
"stretched forth to me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The trial was very short and very clear. Such things as could be said","Great Expectations"
"for him were said,—how he had taken to industrious habits, and had","Great Expectations"
"thriven lawfully and reputably. But nothing could unsay the fact that","Great Expectations"
"he had returned, and was there in presence of the Judge and Jury. It","Great Expectations"
"was impossible to try him for that, and do otherwise than find him","Great Expectations"
"guilty.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"At that time, it was the custom (as I learnt from my terrible","Great Expectations"
"experience of that Sessions) to devote a concluding day to the passing","Great Expectations"
"of Sentences, and to make a finishing effect with the Sentence of","Great Expectations"
"Death. But for the indelible picture that my remembrance now holds","Great Expectations"
"before me, I could scarcely believe, even as I write these words, that","Great Expectations"
"I saw two-and-thirty men and women put before the Judge to receive that","Great Expectations"
"sentence together. Foremost among the two-and-thirty was he; seated,","Great Expectations"
"that he might get breath enough to keep life in him.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The whole scene starts out again in the vivid colours of the moment,","Great Expectations"
"down to the drops of April rain on the windows of the court, glittering","Great Expectations"
"in the rays of April sun. Penned in the dock, as I again stood outside","Great Expectations"
"it at the corner with his hand in mine, were the two-and-thirty men and","Great Expectations"
"women; some defiant, some stricken with terror, some sobbing and","Great Expectations"
"weeping, some covering their faces, some staring gloomily about. There","Great Expectations"
"had been shrieks from among the women convicts; but they had been","Great Expectations"
"stilled, and a hush had succeeded. The sheriffs with their great chains","Great Expectations"
"and nosegays, other civic gewgaws and monsters, criers, ushers, a great","Great Expectations"
"gallery full of people,—a large theatrical audience,—looked on, as the","Great Expectations"
"two-and-thirty and the Judge were solemnly confronted. Then the Judge","Great Expectations"
"addressed them. Among the wretched creatures before him whom he must","Great Expectations"
"single out for special address was one who almost from his infancy had","Great Expectations"
"been an offender against the laws; who, after repeated imprisonments","Great Expectations"
"and punishments, had been at length sentenced to exile for a term of","Great Expectations"
"years; and who, under circumstances of great violence and daring, had","Great Expectations"
"made his escape and been re-sentenced to exile for life. That miserable","Great Expectations"
"man would seem for a time to have become convinced of his errors, when","Great Expectations"
"far removed from the scenes of his old offences, and to have lived a","Great Expectations"
"peaceable and honest life. But in a fatal moment, yielding to those","Great Expectations"
"propensities and passions, the indulgence of which had so long rendered","Great Expectations"
"him a scourge to society, he had quitted his haven of rest and","Great Expectations"
"repentance, and had come back to the country where he was proscribed.","Great Expectations"
"Being here presently denounced, he had for a time succeeded in evading","Great Expectations"
"the officers of Justice, but being at length seized while in the act of","Great Expectations"
"flight, he had resisted them, and had—he best knew whether by express","Great Expectations"
"design, or in the blindness of his hardihood—caused the death of his","Great Expectations"
"denouncer, to whom his whole career was known. The appointed punishment","Great Expectations"
"for his return to the land that had cast him out, being Death, and his","Great Expectations"
"case being this aggravated case, he must prepare himself to Die.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The sun was striking in at the great windows of the court, through the","Great Expectations"
"glittering drops of rain upon the glass, and it made a broad shaft of","Great Expectations"
"light between the two-and-thirty and the Judge, linking both together,","Great Expectations"
"and perhaps reminding some among the audience how both were passing on,","Great Expectations"
"with absolute equality, to the greater Judgment that knoweth all","Great Expectations"
"things, and cannot err. Rising for a moment, a distinct speck of face","Great Expectations"
"in this way of light, the prisoner said, “My Lord, I have received my","Great Expectations"
"sentence of Death from the Almighty, but I bow to yours,” and sat down","Great Expectations"
"again. There was some hushing, and the Judge went on with what he had","Great Expectations"
"to say to the rest. Then they were all formally doomed, and some of","Great Expectations"
"them were supported out, and some of them sauntered out with a haggard","Great Expectations"
"look of bravery, and a few nodded to the gallery, and two or three","Great Expectations"
"shook hands, and others went out chewing the fragments of herb they had","Great Expectations"
"taken from the sweet herbs lying about. He went last of all, because of","Great Expectations"
"having to be helped from his chair, and to go very slowly; and he held","Great Expectations"
"my hand while all the others were removed, and while the audience got","Great Expectations"
"up (putting their dresses right, as they might at church or elsewhere),","Great Expectations"
"and pointed down at this criminal or at that, and most of all at him","Great Expectations"
"and me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I earnestly hoped and prayed that he might die before the Recorder’s","Great Expectations"
"Report was made; but, in the dread of his lingering on, I began that","Great Expectations"
"night to write out a petition to the Home Secretary of State, setting","Great Expectations"
"forth my knowledge of him, and how it was that he had come back for my","Great Expectations"
"sake. I wrote it as fervently and pathetically as I could; and when I","Great Expectations"
"had finished it and sent it in, I wrote out other petitions to such men","Great Expectations"
"in authority as I hoped were the most merciful, and drew up one to the","Great Expectations"
"Crown itself. For several days and nights after he was sentenced I took","Great Expectations"
"no rest except when I fell asleep in my chair, but was wholly absorbed","Great Expectations"
"in these appeals. And after I had sent them in, I could not keep away","Great Expectations"
"from the places where they were, but felt as if they were more hopeful","Great Expectations"
"and less desperate when I was near them. In this unreasonable","Great Expectations"
"restlessness and pain of mind I would roam the streets of an evening,","Great Expectations"
"wandering by those offices and houses where I had left the petitions.","Great Expectations"
"To the present hour, the weary western streets of London on a cold,","Great Expectations"
"dusty spring night, with their ranges of stern, shut-up mansions, and","Great Expectations"
"their long rows of lamps, are melancholy to me from this association.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The daily visits I could make him were shortened now, and he was more","Great Expectations"
"strictly kept. Seeing, or fancying, that I was suspected of an","Great Expectations"
"intention of carrying poison to him, I asked to be searched before I","Great Expectations"
"sat down at his bedside, and told the officer who was always there,","Great Expectations"
"that I was willing to do anything that would assure him of the","Great Expectations"
"singleness of my designs. Nobody was hard with him or with me. There","Great Expectations"
"was duty to be done, and it was done, but not harshly. The officer","Great Expectations"
"always gave me the assurance that he was worse, and some other sick","Great Expectations"
"prisoners in the room, and some other prisoners who attended on them as","Great Expectations"
"sick nurses, (malefactors, but not incapable of kindness, God be","Great Expectations"
"thanked!) always joined in the same report.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As the days went on, I noticed more and more that he would lie placidly","Great Expectations"
"looking at the white ceiling, with an absence of light in his face","Great Expectations"
"until some word of mine brightened it for an instant, and then it would","Great Expectations"
"subside again. Sometimes he was almost or quite unable to speak, then","Great Expectations"
"he would answer me with slight pressures on my hand, and I grew to","Great Expectations"
"understand his meaning very well.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The number of the days had risen to ten, when I saw a greater change in","Great Expectations"
"him than I had seen yet. His eyes were turned towards the door, and","Great Expectations"
"lighted up as I entered.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Dear boy,” he said, as I sat down by his bed: “I thought you was late.","Great Expectations"
"But I knowed you couldn’t be that.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It is just the time,” said I. “I waited for it at the gate.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You always waits at the gate; don’t you, dear boy?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes. Not to lose a moment of the time.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Thank’ee dear boy, thank’ee. God bless you! You’ve never deserted me,","Great Expectations"
"dear boy.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I pressed his hand in silence, for I could not forget that I had once","Great Expectations"
"meant to desert him.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And what’s the best of all,” he said, “you’ve been more comfortable","Great Expectations"
"alonger me, since I was under a dark cloud, than when the sun shone.","Great Expectations"
"That’s best of all.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He lay on his back, breathing with great difficulty. Do what he would,","Great Expectations"
"and love me though he did, the light left his face ever and again, and","Great Expectations"
"a film came over the placid look at the white ceiling.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Are you in much pain to-day?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I don’t complain of none, dear boy.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You never do complain.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"He had spoken his last words. He smiled, and I understood his touch to","Great Expectations"
"mean that he wished to lift my hand, and lay it on his breast. I laid","Great Expectations"
"it there, and he smiled again, and put both his hands upon it.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The allotted time ran out, while we were thus; but, looking round, I","Great Expectations"
"found the governor of the prison standing near me, and he whispered,","Great Expectations"
"“You needn’t go yet.” I thanked him gratefully, and asked, “Might I","Great Expectations"
"speak to him, if he can hear me?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The governor stepped aside, and beckoned the officer away. The change,","Great Expectations"
"though it was made without noise, drew back the film from the placid","Great Expectations"
"look at the white ceiling, and he looked most affectionately at me.","Great Expectations"

"","Great Expectations"
"“You had a child once, whom you loved and lost.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"

"","Great Expectations"
"“She lived, and found powerful friends. She is living now. She is a","Great Expectations"

"","Great Expectations"
"With a last faint effort, which would have been powerless but for my","Great Expectations"
"yielding to it and assisting it, he raised my hand to his lips. Then,","Great Expectations"
"he gently let it sink upon his breast again, with his own hands lying","Great Expectations"
"on it. The placid look at the white ceiling came back, and passed away,","Great Expectations"
"and his head dropped quietly on his breast.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Mindful, then, of what we had read together, I thought of the two men","Great Expectations"

"Chapter LVII.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Now that I was left wholly to myself, I gave notice of my intention to","Great Expectations"
"quit the chambers in the Temple as soon as my tenancy could legally","Great Expectations"
"determine, and in the meanwhile to underlet them. At once I put bills","Great Expectations"
"up in the windows; for, I was in debt, and had scarcely any money, and","Great Expectations"
"began to be seriously alarmed by the state of my affairs. I ought","Great Expectations"
"rather to write that I should have been alarmed if I had had energy and","Great Expectations"
"concentration enough to help me to the clear perception of any truth","Great Expectations"
"beyond the fact that I was falling very ill. The late stress upon me","Great Expectations"
"had enabled me to put off illness, but not to put it away; I knew that","Great Expectations"
"it was coming on me now, and I knew very little else, and was even","Great Expectations"
"careless as to that.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"For a day or two, I lay on the sofa, or on the floor,—anywhere,","Great Expectations"
"according as I happened to sink down,—with a heavy head and aching","Great Expectations"
"limbs, and no purpose, and no power. Then there came, one night which","Great Expectations"
"appeared of great duration, and which teemed with anxiety and horror;","Great Expectations"
"and when in the morning I tried to sit up in my bed and think of it, I","Great Expectations"
"found I could not do so.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Whether I really had been down in Garden Court in the dead of the","Great Expectations"
"night, groping about for the boat that I supposed to be there; whether","Great Expectations"
"I had two or three times come to myself on the staircase with great","Great Expectations"
"terror, not knowing how I had got out of bed; whether I had found","Great Expectations"
"myself lighting the lamp, possessed by the idea that he was coming up","Great Expectations"
"the stairs, and that the lights were blown out; whether I had been","Great Expectations"
"inexpressibly harassed by the distracted talking, laughing, and","Great Expectations"
"groaning of some one, and had half suspected those sounds to be of my","Great Expectations"
"own making; whether there had been a closed iron furnace in a dark","Great Expectations"
"corner of the room, and a voice had called out, over and over again,","Great Expectations"
"that Miss Havisham was consuming within it,—these were things that I","Great Expectations"
"tried to settle with myself and get into some order, as I lay that","Great Expectations"
"morning on my bed. But the vapour of a limekiln would come between me","Great Expectations"
"and them, disordering them all, and it was through the vapour at last","Great Expectations"
"that I saw two men looking at me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What do you want?” I asked, starting; “I don’t know you.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well, sir,” returned one of them, bending down and touching me on the","Great Expectations"
"shoulder, “this is a matter that you’ll soon arrange, I dare say, but","Great Expectations"
"you’re arrested.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What is the debt?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Hundred and twenty-three pound, fifteen, six. Jeweller’s account, I","Great Expectations"
"think.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“What is to be done?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You had better come to my house,” said the man. “I keep a very nice","Great Expectations"
"house.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I made some attempt to get up and dress myself. When I next attended to","Great Expectations"
"them, they were standing a little off from the bed, looking at me. I","Great Expectations"
"still lay there.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You see my state,” said I. “I would come with you if I could; but","Great Expectations"
"indeed I am quite unable. If you take me from here, I think I shall die","Great Expectations"
"by the way.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Perhaps they replied, or argued the point, or tried to encourage me to","Great Expectations"
"believe that I was better than I thought. Forasmuch as they hang in my","Great Expectations"
"memory by only this one slender thread, I don’t know what they did,","Great Expectations"
"except that they forbore to remove me.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"That I had a fever and was avoided, that I suffered greatly, that I","Great Expectations"
"often lost my reason, that the time seemed interminable, that I","Great Expectations"
"confounded impossible existences with my own identity; that I was a","Great Expectations"
"brick in the house-wall, and yet entreating to be released from the","Great Expectations"
"giddy place where the builders had set me; that I was a steel beam of a","Great Expectations"
"vast engine, clashing and whirling over a gulf, and yet that I implored","Great Expectations"
"in my own person to have the engine stopped, and my part in it hammered","Great Expectations"
"off; that I passed through these phases of disease, I know of my own","Great Expectations"
"remembrance, and did in some sort know at the time. That I sometimes","Great Expectations"
"struggled with real people, in the belief that they were murderers, and","Great Expectations"
"that I would all at once comprehend that they meant to do me good, and","Great Expectations"
"would then sink exhausted in their arms, and suffer them to lay me","Great Expectations"
"down, I also knew at the time. But, above all, I knew that there was a","Great Expectations"
"constant tendency in all these people,—who, when I was very ill, would","Great Expectations"
"present all kinds of extraordinary transformations of the human face,","Great Expectations"
"and would be much dilated in size,—above all, I say, I knew that there","Great Expectations"
"was an extraordinary tendency in all these people, sooner or later, to","Great Expectations"
"settle down into the likeness of Joe.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"After I had turned the worst point of my illness, I began to notice","Great Expectations"
"that while all its other features changed, this one consistent feature","Great Expectations"
"did not change. Whoever came about me, still settled down into Joe. I","Great Expectations"
"opened my eyes in the night, and I saw, in the great chair at the","Great Expectations"
"bedside, Joe. I opened my eyes in the day, and, sitting on the","Great Expectations"
"window-seat, smoking his pipe in the shaded open window, still I saw","Great Expectations"
"Joe. I asked for cooling drink, and the dear hand that gave it me was","Great Expectations"
"Joe’s. I sank back on my pillow after drinking, and the face that","Great Expectations"
"looked so hopefully and tenderly upon me was the face of Joe.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"At last, one day, I took courage, and said, “_Is_ it Joe?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"And the dear old home-voice answered, “Which it air, old chap.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“O Joe, you break my heart! Look angry at me, Joe. Strike me, Joe. Tell","Great Expectations"
"me of my ingratitude. Don’t be so good to me!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"For Joe had actually laid his head down on the pillow at my side, and","Great Expectations"
"put his arm round my neck, in his joy that I knew him.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Which dear old Pip, old chap,” said Joe, “you and me was ever friends.","Great Expectations"
"And when you’re well enough to go out for a ride—what larks!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"After which, Joe withdrew to the window, and stood with his back","Great Expectations"
"towards me, wiping his eyes. And as my extreme weakness prevented me","Great Expectations"
"from getting up and going to him, I lay there, penitently whispering,","Great Expectations"
"“O God bless him! O God bless this gentle Christian man!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Joe’s eyes were red when I next found him beside me; but I was holding","Great Expectations"
"his hand, and we both felt happy.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“How long, dear Joe?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Which you meantersay, Pip, how long have your illness lasted, dear old","Great Expectations"
"chap?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, Joe.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It’s the end of May, Pip. To-morrow is the first of June.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And have you been here all that time, dear Joe?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Pretty nigh, old chap. For, as I says to Biddy when the news of your","Great Expectations"
"being ill were brought by letter, which it were brought by the post,","Great Expectations"
"and being formerly single he is now married though underpaid for a deal","Great Expectations"
"of walking and shoe-leather, but wealth were not a object on his part,","Great Expectations"
"and marriage were the great wish of his hart—”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It is so delightful to hear you, Joe! But I interrupt you in what you","Great Expectations"
"said to Biddy.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Which it were,” said Joe, “that how you might be amongst strangers,","Great Expectations"
"and that how you and me having been ever friends, a wisit at such a","Great Expectations"
"moment might not prove unacceptabobble. And Biddy, her word were, ‘Go","Great Expectations"
"to him, without loss of time.’ That,” said Joe, summing up with his","Great Expectations"
"judicial air, “were the word of Biddy. ‘Go to him,’ Biddy say, ‘without","Great Expectations"
"loss of time.’ In short, I shouldn’t greatly deceive you,” Joe added,","Great Expectations"
"after a little grave reflection, “if I represented to you that the word","Great Expectations"
"of that young woman were, ‘without a minute’s loss of time.’”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"There Joe cut himself short, and informed me that I was to be talked to","Great Expectations"
"in great moderation, and that I was to take a little nourishment at","Great Expectations"
"stated frequent times, whether I felt inclined for it or not, and that","Great Expectations"
"I was to submit myself to all his orders. So I kissed his hand, and lay","Great Expectations"
"quiet, while he proceeded to indite a note to Biddy, with my love in","Great Expectations"
"it.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Evidently Biddy had taught Joe to write. As I lay in bed looking at","Great Expectations"
"him, it made me, in my weak state, cry again with pleasure to see the","Great Expectations"
"pride with which he set about his letter. My bedstead, divested of its","Great Expectations"
"curtains, had been removed, with me upon it, into the sitting-room, as","Great Expectations"
"the airiest and largest, and the carpet had been taken away, and the","Great Expectations"
"room kept always fresh and wholesome night and day. At my own","Great Expectations"
"writing-table, pushed into a corner and cumbered with little bottles,","Great Expectations"
"Joe now sat down to his great work, first choosing a pen from the","Great Expectations"
"pen-tray as if it were a chest of large tools, and tucking up his","Great Expectations"
"sleeves as if he were going to wield a crow-bar or sledgehammer. It was","Great Expectations"
"necessary for Joe to hold on heavily to the table with his left elbow,","Great Expectations"
"and to get his right leg well out behind him, before he could begin;","Great Expectations"
"and when he did begin he made every downstroke so slowly that it might","Great Expectations"
"have been six feet long, while at every upstroke I could hear his pen","Great Expectations"
"spluttering extensively. He had a curious idea that the inkstand was on","Great Expectations"
"the side of him where it was not, and constantly dipped his pen into","Great Expectations"
"space, and seemed quite satisfied with the result. Occasionally, he was","Great Expectations"
"tripped up by some orthographical stumbling-block; but on the whole he","Great Expectations"
"got on very well indeed; and when he had signed his name, and had","Great Expectations"
"removed a finishing blot from the paper to the crown of his head with","Great Expectations"
"his two forefingers, he got up and hovered about the table, trying the","Great Expectations"
"effect of his performance from various points of view, as it lay there,","Great Expectations"
"with unbounded satisfaction.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Not to make Joe uneasy by talking too much, even if I had been able to","Great Expectations"
"talk much, I deferred asking him about Miss Havisham until next day. He","Great Expectations"
"shook his head when I then asked him if she had recovered.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Is she dead, Joe?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Why you see, old chap,” said Joe, in a tone of remonstrance, and by","Great Expectations"
"way of getting at it by degrees, “I wouldn’t go so far as to say that,","Great Expectations"
"for that’s a deal to say; but she ain’t—”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Living, Joe?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“That’s nigher where it is,” said Joe; “she ain’t living.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Did she linger long, Joe?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Arter you was took ill, pretty much about what you might call (if you","Great Expectations"
"was put to it) a week,” said Joe; still determined, on my account, to","Great Expectations"
"come at everything by degrees.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Dear Joe, have you heard what becomes of her property?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well, old chap,” said Joe, “it do appear that she had settled the most","Great Expectations"
"of it, which I meantersay tied it up, on Miss Estella. But she had","Great Expectations"
"wrote out a little coddleshell in her own hand a day or two afore the","Great Expectations"
"accident, leaving a cool four thousand to Mr. Matthew Pocket. And why,","Great Expectations"
"do you suppose, above all things, Pip, she left that cool four thousand","Great Expectations"
"unto him? ‘Because of Pip’s account of him, the said Matthew.’ I am","Great Expectations"
"told by Biddy, that air the writing,” said Joe, repeating the legal","Great Expectations"
"turn as if it did him infinite good, “‘account of him the said","Great Expectations"
"Matthew.’ And a cool four thousand, Pip!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I never discovered from whom Joe derived the conventional temperature","Great Expectations"
"of the four thousand pounds; but it appeared to make the sum of money","Great Expectations"
"more to him, and he had a manifest relish in insisting on its being","Great Expectations"
"cool.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"This account gave me great joy, as it perfected the only good thing I","Great Expectations"
"had done. I asked Joe whether he had heard if any of the other","Great Expectations"
"relations had any legacies?","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Miss Sarah,” said Joe, “she have twenty-five pound perannium fur to","Great Expectations"
"buy pills, on account of being bilious. Miss Georgiana, she have twenty","Great Expectations"
"pound down. Mrs.—what’s the name of them wild beasts with humps, old","Great Expectations"
"chap?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Camels?” said I, wondering why he could possibly want to know.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Joe nodded. “Mrs. Camels,” by which I presently understood he meant","Great Expectations"
"Camilla, “she have five pound fur to buy rushlights to put her in","Great Expectations"
"spirits when she wake up in the night.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The accuracy of these recitals was sufficiently obvious to me, to give","Great Expectations"
"me great confidence in Joe’s information. “And now,” said Joe, “you","Great Expectations"
"ain’t that strong yet, old chap, that you can take in more nor one","Great Expectations"
"additional shovelful to-day. Old Orlick he’s been a bustin’ open a","Great Expectations"
"dwelling-ouse.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Whose?” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Not, I grant you, but what his manners is given to blusterous,” said","Great Expectations"
"Joe, apologetically; “still, a Englishman’s ouse is his Castle, and","Great Expectations"
"castles must not be busted ’cept when done in war time. And wotsume’er","Great Expectations"
"the failings on his part, he were a corn and seedsman in his hart.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Is it Pumblechook’s house that has been broken into, then?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“That’s it, Pip,” said Joe; “and they took his till, and they took his","Great Expectations"
"cash-box, and they drinked his wine, and they partook of his wittles,","Great Expectations"
"and they slapped his face, and they pulled his nose, and they tied him","Great Expectations"
"up to his bedpust, and they giv’ him a dozen, and they stuffed his","Great Expectations"
"mouth full of flowering annuals to prewent his crying out. But he","Great Expectations"
"knowed Orlick, and Orlick’s in the county jail.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"By these approaches we arrived at unrestricted conversation. I was slow","Great Expectations"
"to gain strength, but I did slowly and surely become less weak, and Joe","Great Expectations"
"stayed with me, and I fancied I was little Pip again.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"For the tenderness of Joe was so beautifully proportioned to my need,","Great Expectations"
"that I was like a child in his hands. He would sit and talk to me in","Great Expectations"
"the old confidence, and with the old simplicity, and in the old","Great Expectations"
"unassertive protecting way, so that I would half believe that all my","Great Expectations"
"life since the days of the old kitchen was one of the mental troubles","Great Expectations"
"of the fever that was gone. He did everything for me except the","Great Expectations"
"household work, for which he had engaged a very decent woman, after","Great Expectations"
"paying off the laundress on his first arrival. “Which I do assure you,","Great Expectations"
"Pip,” he would often say, in explanation of that liberty; “I found her","Great Expectations"
"a tapping the spare bed, like a cask of beer, and drawing off the","Great Expectations"
"feathers in a bucket, for sale. Which she would have tapped yourn next,","Great Expectations"
"and draw’d it off with you a laying on it, and was then a carrying away","Great Expectations"
"the coals gradiwally in the soup-tureen and wegetable-dishes, and the","Great Expectations"
"wine and spirits in your Wellington boots.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We looked forward to the day when I should go out for a ride, as we had","Great Expectations"
"once looked forward to the day of my apprenticeship. And when the day","Great Expectations"
"came, and an open carriage was got into the Lane, Joe wrapped me up,","Great Expectations"
"took me in his arms, carried me down to it, and put me in, as if I were","Great Expectations"
"still the small helpless creature to whom he had so abundantly given of","Great Expectations"
"the wealth of his great nature.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"And Joe got in beside me, and we drove away together into the country,","Great Expectations"
"where the rich summer growth was already on the trees and on the grass,","Great Expectations"
"and sweet summer scents filled all the air. The day happened to be","Great Expectations"
"Sunday, and when I looked on the loveliness around me, and thought how","Great Expectations"
"it had grown and changed, and how the little wild-flowers had been","Great Expectations"
"forming, and the voices of the birds had been strengthening, by day and","Great Expectations"
"by night, under the sun and under the stars, while poor I lay burning","Great Expectations"
"and tossing on my bed, the mere remembrance of having burned and tossed","Great Expectations"
"there came like a check upon my peace. But when I heard the Sunday","Great Expectations"
"bells, and looked around a little more upon the outspread beauty, I","Great Expectations"
"felt that I was not nearly thankful enough,—that I was too weak yet to","Great Expectations"
"be even that,—and I laid my head on Joe’s shoulder, as I had laid it","Great Expectations"
"long ago when he had taken me to the Fair or where not, and it was too","Great Expectations"
"much for my young senses.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"More composure came to me after a while, and we talked as we used to","Great Expectations"
"talk, lying on the grass at the old Battery. There was no change","Great Expectations"
"whatever in Joe. Exactly what he had been in my eyes then, he was in my","Great Expectations"
"eyes still; just as simply faithful, and as simply right.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"When we got back again, and he lifted me out, and carried me—so","Great Expectations"
"easily!—across the court and up the stairs, I thought of that eventful","Great Expectations"
"Christmas Day when he had carried me over the marshes. We had not yet","Great Expectations"
"made any allusion to my change of fortune, nor did I know how much of","Great Expectations"
"my late history he was acquainted with. I was so doubtful of myself","Great Expectations"
"now, and put so much trust in him, that I could not satisfy myself","Great Expectations"
"whether I ought to refer to it when he did not.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Have you heard, Joe,” I asked him that evening, upon further","Great Expectations"
"consideration, as he smoked his pipe at the window, “who my patron","Great Expectations"
"was?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I heerd,” returned Joe, “as it were not Miss Havisham, old chap.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Did you hear who it was, Joe?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well! I heerd as it were a person what sent the person what giv’ you","Great Expectations"
"the bank-notes at the Jolly Bargemen, Pip.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“So it was.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Astonishing!” said Joe, in the placidest way.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Did you hear that he was dead, Joe?” I presently asked, with","Great Expectations"
"increasing diffidence.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Which? Him as sent the bank-notes, Pip?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I think,” said Joe, after meditating a long time, and looking rather","Great Expectations"
"evasively at the window-seat, “as I _did_ hear tell that how he were","Great Expectations"
"something or another in a general way in that direction.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Did you hear anything of his circumstances, Joe?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Not partickler, Pip.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“If you would like to hear, Joe—” I was beginning, when Joe got up and","Great Expectations"
"came to my sofa.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Lookee here, old chap,” said Joe, bending over me. “Ever the best of","Great Expectations"
"friends; ain’t us, Pip?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I was ashamed to answer him.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Wery good, then,” said Joe, as if I _had_ answered; “that’s all right;","Great Expectations"
"that’s agreed upon. Then why go into subjects, old chap, which as","Great Expectations"
"betwixt two sech must be for ever onnecessary? There’s subjects enough","Great Expectations"
"as betwixt two sech, without onnecessary ones. Lord! To think of your","Great Expectations"
"poor sister and her Rampages! And don’t you remember Tickler?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I do indeed, Joe.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Lookee here, old chap,” said Joe. “I done what I could to keep you and","Great Expectations"
"Tickler in sunders, but my power were not always fully equal to my","Great Expectations"
"inclinations. For when your poor sister had a mind to drop into you, it","Great Expectations"
"were not so much,” said Joe, in his favourite argumentative way, “that","Great Expectations"
"she dropped into me too, if I put myself in opposition to her, but that","Great Expectations"
"she dropped into you always heavier for it. I noticed that. It ain’t a","Great Expectations"
"grab at a man’s whisker, not yet a shake or two of a man (to which your","Great Expectations"
"sister was quite welcome), that ’ud put a man off from getting a little","Great Expectations"
"child out of punishment. But when that little child is dropped into","Great Expectations"
"heavier for that grab of whisker or shaking, then that man naterally up","Great Expectations"
"and says to himself, ‘Where is the good as you are a-doing? I grant you","Great Expectations"
"I see the ’arm,’ says the man, ‘but I don’t see the good. I call upon","Great Expectations"
"you, sir, therefore, to pint out the good.’”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“The man says?” I observed, as Joe waited for me to speak.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“The man says,” Joe assented. “Is he right, that man?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Dear Joe, he is always right.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Well, old chap,” said Joe, “then abide by your words. If he’s always","Great Expectations"
"right (which in general he’s more likely wrong), he’s right when he","Great Expectations"
"says this: Supposing ever you kep any little matter to yourself, when","Great Expectations"
"you was a little child, you kep it mostly because you know’d as J.","Great Expectations"
"Gargery’s power to part you and Tickler in sunders were not fully equal","Great Expectations"
"to his inclinations. Theerfore, think no more of it as betwixt two","Great Expectations"
"sech, and do not let us pass remarks upon onnecessary subjects. Biddy","Great Expectations"
"giv’ herself a deal o’ trouble with me afore I left (for I am almost","Great Expectations"
"awful dull), as I should view it in this light, and, viewing it in this","Great Expectations"
"light, as I should so put it. Both of which,” said Joe, quite charmed","Great Expectations"
"with his logical arrangement, “being done, now this to you a true","Great Expectations"
"friend, say. Namely. You mustn’t go a overdoing on it, but you must","Great Expectations"
"have your supper and your wine and water, and you must be put betwixt","Great Expectations"
"the sheets.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The delicacy with which Joe dismissed this theme, and the sweet tact","Great Expectations"
"and kindness with which Biddy—who with her woman’s wit had found me out","Great Expectations"
"so soon—had prepared him for it, made a deep impression on my mind. But","Great Expectations"
"whether Joe knew how poor I was, and how my great expectations had all","Great Expectations"
"dissolved, like our own marsh mists before the sun, I could not","Great Expectations"
"understand.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Another thing in Joe that I could not understand when it first began to","Great Expectations"
"develop itself, but which I soon arrived at a sorrowful comprehension","Great Expectations"
"of, was this: As I became stronger and better, Joe became a little less","Great Expectations"
"easy with me. In my weakness and entire dependence on him, the dear","Great Expectations"
"fellow had fallen into the old tone, and called me by the old names,","Great Expectations"
"the dear “old Pip, old chap,” that now were music in my ears. I too had","Great Expectations"
"fallen into the old ways, only happy and thankful that he let me. But,","Great Expectations"
"imperceptibly, though I held by them fast, Joe’s hold upon them began","Great Expectations"
"to slacken; and whereas I wondered at this, at first, I soon began to","Great Expectations"
"understand that the cause of it was in me, and that the fault of it was","Great Expectations"
"all mine.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Ah! Had I given Joe no reason to doubt my constancy, and to think that","Great Expectations"
"in prosperity I should grow cold to him and cast him off? Had I given","Great Expectations"
"Joe’s innocent heart no cause to feel instinctively that as I got","Great Expectations"
"stronger, his hold upon me would be weaker, and that he had better","Great Expectations"
"loosen it in time and let me go, before I plucked myself away?","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was on the third or fourth occasion of my going out walking in the","Great Expectations"
"Temple Gardens leaning on Joe’s arm, that I saw this change in him very","Great Expectations"
"plainly. We had been sitting in the bright warm sunlight, looking at","Great Expectations"
"the river, and I chanced to say as we got up,—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“See, Joe! I can walk quite strongly. Now, you shall see me walk back","Great Expectations"
"by myself.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Which do not overdo it, Pip,” said Joe; “but I shall be happy fur to","Great Expectations"
"see you able, sir.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The last word grated on me; but how could I remonstrate! I walked no","Great Expectations"
"further than the gate of the gardens, and then pretended to be weaker","Great Expectations"
"than I was, and asked Joe for his arm. Joe gave it me, but was","Great Expectations"
"thoughtful.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I, for my part, was thoughtful too; for, how best to check this growing","Great Expectations"
"change in Joe was a great perplexity to my remorseful thoughts. That I","Great Expectations"
"was ashamed to tell him exactly how I was placed, and what I had come","Great Expectations"
"down to, I do not seek to conceal; but I hope my reluctance was not","Great Expectations"
"quite an unworthy one. He would want to help me out of his little","Great Expectations"
"savings, I knew, and I knew that he ought not to help me, and that I","Great Expectations"
"must not suffer him to do it.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was a thoughtful evening with both of us. But, before we went to","Great Expectations"
"bed, I had resolved that I would wait over to-morrow,—to-morrow being","Great Expectations"
"Sunday,—and would begin my new course with the new week. On Monday","Great Expectations"
"morning I would speak to Joe about this change, I would lay aside this","Great Expectations"
"last vestige of reserve, I would tell him what I had in my thoughts","Great Expectations"
"(that Secondly, not yet arrived at), and why I had not decided to go","Great Expectations"
"out to Herbert, and then the change would be conquered for ever. As I","Great Expectations"
"cleared, Joe cleared, and it seemed as though he had sympathetically","Great Expectations"
"arrived at a resolution too.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We had a quiet day on the Sunday, and we rode out into the country, and","Great Expectations"
"then walked in the fields.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I feel thankful that I have been ill, Joe,” I said.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Dear old Pip, old chap, you’re a’most come round, sir.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It has been a memorable time for me, Joe.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Likeways for myself, sir,” Joe returned.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“We have had a time together, Joe, that I can never forget. There were","Great Expectations"
"days once, I know, that I did for a while forget; but I never shall","Great Expectations"
"forget these.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Pip,” said Joe, appearing a little hurried and troubled, “there has","Great Expectations"
"been larks. And, dear sir, what have been betwixt us—have been.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"At night, when I had gone to bed, Joe came into my room, as he had done","Great Expectations"
"all through my recovery. He asked me if I felt sure that I was as well","Great Expectations"
"as in the morning?","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, dear Joe, quite.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And are always a getting stronger, old chap?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, dear Joe, steadily.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Joe patted the coverlet on my shoulder with his great good hand, and","Great Expectations"
"said, in what I thought a husky voice, “Good night!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"When I got up in the morning, refreshed and stronger yet, I was full of","Great Expectations"
"my resolution to tell Joe all, without delay. I would tell him before","Great Expectations"
"breakfast. I would dress at once and go to his room and surprise him;","Great Expectations"
"for, it was the first day I had been up early. I went to his room, and","Great Expectations"
"he was not there. Not only was he not there, but his box was gone.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I hurried then to the breakfast-table, and on it found a letter. These","Great Expectations"
"were its brief contents:—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Not wishful to intrude I have departured fur you are well again dear","Great Expectations"
"Pip and will do better without","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"JO.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“P.S. Ever the best of friends.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Enclosed in the letter was a receipt for the debt and costs on which I","Great Expectations"
"had been arrested. Down to that moment, I had vainly supposed that my","Great Expectations"
"creditor had withdrawn, or suspended proceedings until I should be","Great Expectations"
"quite recovered. I had never dreamed of Joe’s having paid the money;","Great Expectations"
"but Joe had paid it, and the receipt was in his name.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"What remained for me now, but to follow him to the dear old forge, and","Great Expectations"
"there to have out my disclosure to him, and my penitent remonstrance","Great Expectations"
"with him, and there to relieve my mind and heart of that reserved","Great Expectations"
"Secondly, which had begun as a vague something lingering in my","Great Expectations"
"thoughts, and had formed into a settled purpose?","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The purpose was, that I would go to Biddy, that I would show her how","Great Expectations"
"humbled and repentant I came back, that I would tell her how I had lost","Great Expectations"
"all I once hoped for, that I would remind her of our old confidences in","Great Expectations"
"my first unhappy time. Then I would say to her, “Biddy, I think you","Great Expectations"
"once liked me very well, when my errant heart, even while it strayed","Great Expectations"
"away from you, was quieter and better with you than it ever has been","Great Expectations"
"since. If you can like me only half as well once more, if you can take","Great Expectations"
"me with all my faults and disappointments on my head, if you can","Great Expectations"
"receive me like a forgiven child (and indeed I am as sorry, Biddy, and","Great Expectations"
"have as much need of a hushing voice and a soothing hand), I hope I am","Great Expectations"
"a little worthier of you that I was,—not much, but a little. And,","Great Expectations"
"Biddy, it shall rest with you to say whether I shall work at the forge","Great Expectations"
"with Joe, or whether I shall try for any different occupation down in","Great Expectations"
"this country, or whether we shall go away to a distant place where an","Great Expectations"
"opportunity awaits me which I set aside, when it was offered, until I","Great Expectations"
"knew your answer. And now, dear Biddy, if you can tell me that you will","Great Expectations"
"go through the world with me, you will surely make it a better world","Great Expectations"
"for me, and me a better man for it, and I will try hard to make it a","Great Expectations"
"better world for you.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Such was my purpose. After three days more of recovery, I went down to","Great Expectations"
"the old place to put it in execution. And how I sped in it is all I","Great Expectations"
"have left to tell.","Great Expectations"

"Chapter LVIII.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The tidings of my high fortunes having had a heavy fall had got down to","Great Expectations"
"my native place and its neighbourhood before I got there. I found the","Great Expectations"
"Blue Boar in possession of the intelligence, and I found that it made a","Great Expectations"
"great change in the Boar’s demeanour. Whereas the Boar had cultivated","Great Expectations"
"my good opinion with warm assiduity when I was coming into property,","Great Expectations"
"the Boar was exceedingly cool on the subject now that I was going out","Great Expectations"
"of property.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was evening when I arrived, much fatigued by the journey I had so","Great Expectations"
"often made so easily. The Boar could not put me into my usual bedroom,","Great Expectations"
"which was engaged (probably by some one who had expectations), and","Great Expectations"
"could only assign me a very indifferent chamber among the pigeons and","Great Expectations"
"post-chaises up the yard. But I had as sound a sleep in that lodging as","Great Expectations"
"in the most superior accommodation the Boar could have given me, and","Great Expectations"
"the quality of my dreams was about the same as in the best bedroom.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Early in the morning, while my breakfast was getting ready, I strolled","Great Expectations"
"round by Satis House. There were printed bills on the gate and on bits","Great Expectations"
"of carpet hanging out of the windows, announcing a sale by auction of","Great Expectations"
"the Household Furniture and Effects, next week. The House itself was to","Great Expectations"
"be sold as old building materials, and pulled down. LOT 1 was marked in","Great Expectations"
"whitewashed knock-knee letters on the brew house; LOT 2 on that part of","Great Expectations"
"the main building which had been so long shut up. Other lots were","Great Expectations"
"marked off on other parts of the structure, and the ivy had been torn","Great Expectations"
"down to make room for the inscriptions, and much of it trailed low in","Great Expectations"
"the dust and was withered already. Stepping in for a moment at the open","Great Expectations"
"gate, and looking around me with the uncomfortable air of a stranger","Great Expectations"
"who had no business there, I saw the auctioneer’s clerk walking on the","Great Expectations"
"casks and telling them off for the information of a catalogue-compiler,","Great Expectations"
"pen in hand, who made a temporary desk of the wheeled chair I had so","Great Expectations"
"often pushed along to the tune of Old Clem.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"When I got back to my breakfast in the Boar’s coffee-room, I found Mr.","Great Expectations"
"Pumblechook conversing with the landlord. Mr. Pumblechook (not improved","Great Expectations"
"in appearance by his late nocturnal adventure) was waiting for me, and","Great Expectations"
"addressed me in the following terms:—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Young man, I am sorry to see you brought low. But what else could be","Great Expectations"
"expected! what else could be expected!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"As he extended his hand with a magnificently forgiving air, and as I","Great Expectations"
"was broken by illness and unfit to quarrel, I took it.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“William,” said Mr. Pumblechook to the waiter, “put a muffin on table.","Great Expectations"
"And has it come to this! Has it come to this!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I frowningly sat down to my breakfast. Mr. Pumblechook stood over me","Great Expectations"
"and poured out my tea—before I could touch the teapot—with the air of a","Great Expectations"
"benefactor who was resolved to be true to the last.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“William,” said Mr. Pumblechook, mournfully, “put the salt on. In","Great Expectations"
"happier times,” addressing me, “I think you took sugar? And did you","Great Expectations"
"take milk? You did. Sugar and milk. William, bring a watercress.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Thank you,” said I, shortly, “but I don’t eat watercresses.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You don’t eat ’em,” returned Mr. Pumblechook, sighing and nodding his","Great Expectations"
"head several times, as if he might have expected that, and as if","Great Expectations"
"abstinence from watercresses were consistent with my downfall. “True.","Great Expectations"
"The simple fruits of the earth. No. You needn’t bring any, William.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I went on with my breakfast, and Mr. Pumblechook continued to stand","Great Expectations"
"over me, staring fishily and breathing noisily, as he always did.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Little more than skin and bone!” mused Mr. Pumblechook, aloud. “And","Great Expectations"
"yet when he went from here (I may say with my blessing), and I spread","Great Expectations"
"afore him my humble store, like the Bee, he was as plump as a Peach!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"This reminded me of the wonderful difference between the servile manner","Great Expectations"
"in which he had offered his hand in my new prosperity, saying, “May I?”","Great Expectations"
"and the ostentatious clemency with which he had just now exhibited the","Great Expectations"
"same fat five fingers.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Hah!” he went on, handing me the bread and butter. “And air you","Great Expectations"
"a-going to Joseph?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“In heaven’s name,” said I, firing in spite of myself, “what does it","Great Expectations"
"matter to you where I am going? Leave that teapot alone.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"It was the worst course I could have taken, because it gave Pumblechook","Great Expectations"
"the opportunity he wanted.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, young man,” said he, releasing the handle of the article in","Great Expectations"
"question, retiring a step or two from my table, and speaking for the","Great Expectations"
"behoof of the landlord and waiter at the door, “I _will_ leave that","Great Expectations"
"teapot alone. You are right, young man. For once you are right. I","Great Expectations"
"forgit myself when I take such an interest in your breakfast, as to","Great Expectations"
"wish your frame, exhausted by the debilitating effects of","Great Expectations"
"prodigygality, to be stimilated by the ’olesome nourishment of your","Great Expectations"
"forefathers. And yet,” said Pumblechook, turning to the landlord and","Great Expectations"
"waiter, and pointing me out at arm’s length, “this is him as I ever","Great Expectations"
"sported with in his days of happy infancy! Tell me not it cannot be; I","Great Expectations"
"tell you this is him!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"A low murmur from the two replied. The waiter appeared to be","Great Expectations"
"particularly affected.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“This is him,” said Pumblechook, “as I have rode in my shay-cart. This","Great Expectations"
"is him as I have seen brought up by hand. This is him untoe the sister","Great Expectations"
"of which I was uncle by marriage, as her name was Georgiana M’ria from","Great Expectations"
"her own mother, let him deny it if he can!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The waiter seemed convinced that I could not deny it, and that it gave","Great Expectations"
"the case a black look.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Young man,” said Pumblechook, screwing his head at me in the old","Great Expectations"
"fashion, “you air a-going to Joseph. What does it matter to me, you ask","Great Expectations"
"me, where you air a-going? I say to you, Sir, you air a-going to","Great Expectations"
"Joseph.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The waiter coughed, as if he modestly invited me to get over that.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Now,” said Pumblechook, and all this with a most exasperating air of","Great Expectations"
"saying in the cause of virtue what was perfectly convincing and","Great Expectations"
"conclusive, “I will tell you what to say to Joseph. Here is Squires of","Great Expectations"
"the Boar present, known and respected in this town, and here is","Great Expectations"
"William, which his father’s name was Potkins if I do not deceive","Great Expectations"
"myself.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You do not, sir,” said William.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“In their presence,” pursued Pumblechook, “I will tell you, young man,","Great Expectations"
"what to say to Joseph. Says you, “Joseph, I have this day seen my","Great Expectations"
"earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortun’s. I will name no","Great Expectations"
"names, Joseph, but so they are pleased to call him up town, and I have","Great Expectations"
"seen that man.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I swear I don’t see him here,” said I.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Say that likewise,” retorted Pumblechook. “Say you said that, and even","Great Expectations"
"Joseph will probably betray surprise.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“There you quite mistake him,” said I. “I know better.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Says you,” Pumblechook went on, “‘Joseph, I have seen that man, and","Great Expectations"
"that man bears you no malice and bears me no malice. He knows your","Great Expectations"
"character, Joseph, and is well acquainted with your pig-headedness and","Great Expectations"
"ignorance; and he knows my character, Joseph, and he knows my want of","Great Expectations"
"gratitoode. Yes, Joseph,’ says you,” here Pumblechook shook his head","Great Expectations"
"and hand at me, “‘he knows my total deficiency of common human","Great Expectations"
"gratitoode. _He_ knows it, Joseph, as none can. _You_ do not know it,","Great Expectations"
"Joseph, having no call to know it, but that man do.’”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Windy donkey as he was, it really amazed me that he could have the face","Great Expectations"
"to talk thus to mine.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Says you, ‘Joseph, he gave me a little message, which I will now","Great Expectations"
"repeat. It was that, in my being brought low, he saw the finger of","Great Expectations"
"Providence. He knowed that finger when he saw Joseph, and he saw it","Great Expectations"
"plain. It pinted out this writing, Joseph. _Reward of ingratitoode to","Great Expectations"
"his earliest benefactor, and founder of fortun’s_. But that man said he","Great Expectations"
"did not repent of what he had done, Joseph. Not at all. It was right to","Great Expectations"
"do it, it was kind to do it, it was benevolent to do it, and he would","Great Expectations"
"do it again.’”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It’s pity,” said I, scornfully, as I finished my interrupted","Great Expectations"
"breakfast, “that the man did not say what he had done and would do","Great Expectations"
"again.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Squires of the Boar!” Pumblechook was now addressing the landlord,","Great Expectations"
"“and William! I have no objections to your mentioning, either up town","Great Expectations"
"or down town, if such should be your wishes, that it was right to do","Great Expectations"
"it, kind to do it, benevolent to do it, and that I would do it again.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"With those words the Impostor shook them both by the hand, with an air,","Great Expectations"
"and left the house; leaving me much more astonished than delighted by","Great Expectations"
"the virtues of that same indefinite “it.” I was not long after him in","Great Expectations"
"leaving the house too, and when I went down the High Street I saw him","Great Expectations"
"holding forth (no doubt to the same effect) at his shop door to a","Great Expectations"
"select group, who honoured me with very unfavourable glances as I","Great Expectations"
"passed on the opposite side of the way.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"But, it was only the pleasanter to turn to Biddy and to Joe, whose","Great Expectations"
"great forbearance shone more brightly than before, if that could be,","Great Expectations"
"contrasted with this brazen pretender. I went towards them slowly, for","Great Expectations"
"my limbs were weak, but with a sense of increasing relief as I drew","Great Expectations"
"nearer to them, and a sense of leaving arrogance and untruthfulness","Great Expectations"
"further and further behind.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The June weather was delicious. The sky was blue, the larks were","Great Expectations"
"soaring high over the green corn, I thought all that countryside more","Great Expectations"
"beautiful and peaceful by far than I had ever known it to be yet. Many","Great Expectations"
"pleasant pictures of the life that I would lead there, and of the","Great Expectations"
"change for the better that would come over my character when I had a","Great Expectations"
"guiding spirit at my side whose simple faith and clear home wisdom I","Great Expectations"
"had proved, beguiled my way. They awakened a tender emotion in me; for","Great Expectations"
"my heart was softened by my return, and such a change had come to pass,","Great Expectations"
"that I felt like one who was toiling home barefoot from distant travel,","Great Expectations"
"and whose wanderings had lasted many years.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The schoolhouse where Biddy was mistress I had never seen; but, the","Great Expectations"
"little roundabout lane by which I entered the village, for quietness’","Great Expectations"
"sake, took me past it. I was disappointed to find that the day was a","Great Expectations"
"holiday; no children were there, and Biddy’s house was closed. Some","Great Expectations"
"hopeful notion of seeing her, busily engaged in her daily duties,","Great Expectations"
"before she saw me, had been in my mind and was defeated.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"But the forge was a very short distance off, and I went towards it","Great Expectations"
"under the sweet green limes, listening for the clink of Joe’s hammer.","Great Expectations"
"Long after I ought to have heard it, and long after I had fancied I","Great Expectations"
"heard it and found it but a fancy, all was still. The limes were there,","Great Expectations"
"and the white thorns were there, and the chestnut-trees were there, and","Great Expectations"
"their leaves rustled harmoniously when I stopped to listen; but, the","Great Expectations"
"clink of Joe’s hammer was not in the midsummer wind.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Almost fearing, without knowing why, to come in view of the forge, I","Great Expectations"
"saw it at last, and saw that it was closed. No gleam of fire, no","Great Expectations"
"glittering shower of sparks, no roar of bellows; all shut up, and","Great Expectations"
"still.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"But the house was not deserted, and the best parlour seemed to be in","Great Expectations"
"use, for there were white curtains fluttering in its window, and the","Great Expectations"
"window was open and gay with flowers. I went softly towards it, meaning","Great Expectations"
"to peep over the flowers, when Joe and Biddy stood before me, arm in","Great Expectations"
"arm.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"At first Biddy gave a cry, as if she thought it was my apparition, but","Great Expectations"
"in another moment she was in my embrace. I wept to see her, and she","Great Expectations"
"wept to see me; I, because she looked so fresh and pleasant; she,","Great Expectations"
"because I looked so worn and white.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“But dear Biddy, how smart you are!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, dear Pip.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And Joe, how smart _you_ are!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, dear old Pip, old chap.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I looked at both of them, from one to the other, and then—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“It’s my wedding-day!” cried Biddy, in a burst of happiness, “and I am","Great Expectations"
"married to Joe!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"They had taken me into the kitchen, and I had laid my head down on the","Great Expectations"
"old deal table. Biddy held one of my hands to her lips, and Joe’s","Great Expectations"
"restoring touch was on my shoulder. “Which he warn’t strong enough, my","Great Expectations"
"dear, fur to be surprised,” said Joe. And Biddy said, “I ought to have","Great Expectations"
"thought of it, dear Joe, but I was too happy.” They were both so","Great Expectations"
"overjoyed to see me, so proud to see me, so touched by my coming to","Great Expectations"
"them, so delighted that I should have come by accident to make their","Great Expectations"
"day complete!","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"My first thought was one of great thankfulness that I had never","Great Expectations"
"breathed this last baffled hope to Joe. How often, while he was with me","Great Expectations"
"in my illness, had it risen to my lips! How irrevocable would have been","Great Expectations"
"his knowledge of it, if he had remained with me but another hour!","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Dear Biddy,” said I, “you have the best husband in the whole world,","Great Expectations"
"and if you could have seen him by my bed you would have—But no, you","Great Expectations"
"couldn’t love him better than you do.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No, I couldn’t indeed,” said Biddy.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And, dear Joe, you have the best wife in the whole world, and she will","Great Expectations"
"make you as happy as even you deserve to be, you dear, good, noble","Great Expectations"
"Joe!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Joe looked at me with a quivering lip, and fairly put his sleeve before","Great Expectations"
"his eyes.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And Joe and Biddy both, as you have been to church to-day, and are in","Great Expectations"
"charity and love with all mankind, receive my humble thanks for all you","Great Expectations"
"have done for me, and all I have so ill repaid! And when I say that I","Great Expectations"
"am going away within the hour, for I am soon going abroad, and that I","Great Expectations"
"shall never rest until I have worked for the money with which you have","Great Expectations"
"kept me out of prison, and have sent it to you, don’t think, dear Joe","Great Expectations"
"and Biddy, that if I could repay it a thousand times over, I suppose I","Great Expectations"
"could cancel a farthing of the debt I owe you, or that I would do so if","Great Expectations"
"I could!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"They were both melted by these words, and both entreated me to say no","Great Expectations"
"more.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“But I must say more. Dear Joe, I hope you will have children to love,","Great Expectations"
"and that some little fellow will sit in this chimney-corner of a winter","Great Expectations"
"night, who may remind you of another little fellow gone out of it for","Great Expectations"
"ever. Don’t tell him, Joe, that I was thankless; don’t tell him, Biddy,","Great Expectations"
"that I was ungenerous and unjust; only tell him that I honoured you","Great Expectations"
"both, because you were both so good and true, and that, as your child,","Great Expectations"
"I said it would be natural to him to grow up a much better man than I","Great Expectations"
"did.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I ain’t a-going,” said Joe, from behind his sleeve, “to tell him","Great Expectations"
"nothink o’ that natur, Pip. Nor Biddy ain’t. Nor yet no one ain’t.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And now, though I know you have already done it in your own kind","Great Expectations"
"hearts, pray tell me, both, that you forgive me! Pray let me hear you","Great Expectations"
"say the words, that I may carry the sound of them away with me, and","Great Expectations"
"then I shall be able to believe that you can trust me, and think better","Great Expectations"
"of me, in the time to come!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“O dear old Pip, old chap,” said Joe. “God knows as I forgive you, if I","Great Expectations"
"have anythink to forgive!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Amen! And God knows I do!” echoed Biddy.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Now let me go up and look at my old little room, and rest there a few","Great Expectations"
"minutes by myself. And then, when I have eaten and drunk with you, go","Great Expectations"
"with me as far as the finger-post, dear Joe and Biddy, before we say","Great Expectations"
"good-bye!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I sold all I had, and put aside as much as I could, for a composition","Great Expectations"
"with my creditors,—who gave me ample time to pay them in full,—and I","Great Expectations"
"went out and joined Herbert. Within a month, I had quitted England, and","Great Expectations"
"within two months I was clerk to Clarriker and Co., and within four","Great Expectations"
"months I assumed my first undivided responsibility. For the beam across","Great Expectations"
"the parlour ceiling at Mill Pond Bank had then ceased to tremble under","Great Expectations"
"old Bill Barley’s growls and was at peace, and Herbert had gone away to","Great Expectations"
"marry Clara, and I was left in sole charge of the Eastern Branch until","Great Expectations"
"he brought her back.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Many a year went round before I was a partner in the House; but I lived","Great Expectations"
"happily with Herbert and his wife, and lived frugally, and paid my","Great Expectations"
"debts, and maintained a constant correspondence with Biddy and Joe. It","Great Expectations"
"was not until I became third in the Firm, that Clarriker betrayed me to","Great Expectations"
"Herbert; but he then declared that the secret of Herbert’s partnership","Great Expectations"
"had been long enough upon his conscience, and he must tell it. So he","Great Expectations"
"told it, and Herbert was as much moved as amazed, and the dear fellow","Great Expectations"
"and I were not the worse friends for the long concealment. I must not","Great Expectations"
"leave it to be supposed that we were ever a great House, or that we","Great Expectations"
"made mints of money. We were not in a grand way of business, but we had","Great Expectations"
"a good name, and worked for our profits, and did very well. We owed so","Great Expectations"
"much to Herbert’s ever cheerful industry and readiness, that I often","Great Expectations"
"wondered how I had conceived that old idea of his inaptitude, until I","Great Expectations"
"was one day enlightened by the reflection, that perhaps the inaptitude","Great Expectations"
"had never been in him at all, but had been in me.","Great Expectations"

"Chapter LIX.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"For eleven years, I had not seen Joe nor Biddy with my bodily","Great Expectations"
"eyes,—though they had both been often before my fancy in the","Great Expectations"
"East,—when, upon an evening in December, an hour or two after dark, I","Great Expectations"
"laid my hand softly on the latch of the old kitchen door. I touched it","Great Expectations"
"so softly that I was not heard, and looked in unseen. There, smoking","Great Expectations"
"his pipe in the old place by the kitchen firelight, as hale and as","Great Expectations"
"strong as ever, though a little grey, sat Joe; and there, fenced into","Great Expectations"
"the corner with Joe’s leg, and sitting on my own little stool looking","Great Expectations"
"at the fire, was—I again!","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“We giv’ him the name of Pip for your sake, dear old chap,” said Joe,","Great Expectations"
"delighted, when I took another stool by the child’s side (but I did","Great Expectations"
"_not_ rumple his hair), “and we hoped he might grow a little bit like","Great Expectations"
"you, and we think he do.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I thought so too, and I took him out for a walk next morning, and we","Great Expectations"
"talked immensely, understanding one another to perfection. And I took","Great Expectations"
"him down to the churchyard, and set him on a certain tombstone there,","Great Expectations"
"and he showed me from that elevation which stone was sacred to the","Great Expectations"
"memory of Philip Pirrip, late of this Parish, and Also Georgiana, Wife","Great Expectations"
"of the Above.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Biddy,” said I, when I talked with her after dinner, as her little","Great Expectations"
"girl lay sleeping in her lap, “you must give Pip to me one of these","Great Expectations"
"days; or lend him, at all events.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“No, no,” said Biddy, gently. “You must marry.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“So Herbert and Clara say, but I don’t think I shall, Biddy. I have so","Great Expectations"
"settled down in their home, that it’s not at all likely. I am already","Great Expectations"
"quite an old bachelor.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Biddy looked down at her child, and put its little hand to her lips,","Great Expectations"
"and then put the good matronly hand with which she had touched it into","Great Expectations"
"mine. There was something in the action, and in the light pressure of","Great Expectations"
"Biddy’s wedding-ring, that had a very pretty eloquence in it.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Dear Pip,” said Biddy, “you are sure you don’t fret for her?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“O no,—I think not, Biddy.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Tell me as an old, old friend. Have you quite forgotten her?","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“My dear Biddy, I have forgotten nothing in my life that ever had a","Great Expectations"
"foremost place there, and little that ever had any place there. But","Great Expectations"
"that poor dream, as I once used to call it, has all gone by, Biddy,—all","Great Expectations"
"gone by!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Nevertheless, I knew, while I said those words, that I secretly","Great Expectations"
"intended to revisit the site of the old house that evening, alone, for","Great Expectations"
"her sake. Yes, even so. For Estella’s sake.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I had heard of her as leading a most unhappy life, and as being","Great Expectations"
"separated from her husband, who had used her with great cruelty, and","Great Expectations"
"who had become quite renowned as a compound of pride, avarice,","Great Expectations"
"brutality, and meanness. And I had heard of the death of her husband,","Great Expectations"
"from an accident consequent on his ill-treatment of a horse. This","Great Expectations"
"release had befallen her some two years before; for anything I knew,","Great Expectations"
"she was married again.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The early dinner hour at Joe’s, left me abundance of time, without","Great Expectations"
"hurrying my talk with Biddy, to walk over to the old spot before dark.","Great Expectations"
"But, what with loitering on the way to look at old objects and to think","Great Expectations"
"of old times, the day had quite declined when I came to the place.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"There was no house now, no brewery, no building whatever left, but the","Great Expectations"
"wall of the old garden. The cleared space had been enclosed with a","Great Expectations"
"rough fence, and looking over it, I saw that some of the old ivy had","Great Expectations"
"struck root anew, and was growing green on low quiet mounds of ruin. A","Great Expectations"
"gate in the fence standing ajar, I pushed it open, and went in.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"A cold silvery mist had veiled the afternoon, and the moon was not yet","Great Expectations"
"up to scatter it. But, the stars were shining beyond the mist, and the","Great Expectations"
"moon was coming, and the evening was not dark. I could trace out where","Great Expectations"
"every part of the old house had been, and where the brewery had been,","Great Expectations"
"and where the gates, and where the casks. I had done so, and was","Great Expectations"
"looking along the desolate garden walk, when I beheld a solitary figure","Great Expectations"
"in it.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The figure showed itself aware of me, as I advanced. It had been moving","Great Expectations"
"towards me, but it stood still. As I drew nearer, I saw it to be the","Great Expectations"
"figure of a woman. As I drew nearer yet, it was about to turn away,","Great Expectations"
"when it stopped, and let me come up with it. Then, it faltered, as if","Great Expectations"
"much surprised, and uttered my name, and I cried out,—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Estella!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I am greatly changed. I wonder you know me.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The freshness of her beauty was indeed gone, but its indescribable","Great Expectations"
"majesty and its indescribable charm remained. Those attractions in it,","Great Expectations"
"I had seen before; what I had never seen before, was the saddened,","Great Expectations"
"softened light of the once proud eyes; what I had never felt before was","Great Expectations"
"the friendly touch of the once insensible hand.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"We sat down on a bench that was near, and I said, “After so many years,","Great Expectations"
"it is strange that we should thus meet again, Estella, here where our","Great Expectations"
"first meeting was! Do you often come back?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I have never been here since.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Nor I.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The moon began to rise, and I thought of the placid look at the white","Great Expectations"
"ceiling, which had passed away. The moon began to rise, and I thought","Great Expectations"
"of the pressure on my hand when I had spoken the last words he had","Great Expectations"
"heard on earth.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"Estella was the next to break the silence that ensued between us.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I have very often hoped and intended to come back, but have been","Great Expectations"
"prevented by many circumstances. Poor, poor old place!”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"The silvery mist was touched with the first rays of the moonlight, and","Great Expectations"
"the same rays touched the tears that dropped from her eyes. Not knowing","Great Expectations"
"that I saw them, and setting herself to get the better of them, she","Great Expectations"
"said quietly,—","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Were you wondering, as you walked along, how it came to be left in","Great Expectations"
"this condition?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Yes, Estella.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“The ground belongs to me. It is the only possession I have not","Great Expectations"
"relinquished. Everything else has gone from me, little by little, but I","Great Expectations"
"have kept this. It was the subject of the only determined resistance I","Great Expectations"
"made in all the wretched years.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Is it to be built on?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“At last, it is. I came here to take leave of it before its change. And","Great Expectations"
"you,” she said, in a voice of touching interest to a wanderer,—“you","Great Expectations"
"live abroad still?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Still.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And do well, I am sure?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I work pretty hard for a sufficient living, and therefore—yes, I do","Great Expectations"
"well.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I have often thought of you,” said Estella.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Have you?”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Of late, very often. There was a long hard time when I kept far from","Great Expectations"
"me the remembrance of what I had thrown away when I was quite ignorant","Great Expectations"
"of its worth. But since my duty has not been incompatible with the","Great Expectations"
"admission of that remembrance, I have given it a place in my heart.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“You have always held your place in my heart,” I answered.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"And we were silent again until she spoke.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“I little thought,” said Estella, “that I should take leave of you in","Great Expectations"
"taking leave of this spot. I am very glad to do so.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“Glad to part again, Estella? To me, parting is a painful thing. To me,","Great Expectations"
"the remembrance of our last parting has been ever mournful and","Great Expectations"
"painful.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“But you said to me,” returned Estella, very earnestly, “‘God bless","Great Expectations"
"you, God forgive you!’ And if you could say that to me then, you will","Great Expectations"
"not hesitate to say that to me now,—now, when suffering has been","Great Expectations"
"stronger than all other teaching, and has taught me to understand what","Great Expectations"
"your heart used to be. I have been bent and broken, but—I hope—into a","Great Expectations"
"better shape. Be as considerate and good to me as you were, and tell me","Great Expectations"
"we are friends.”","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“We are friends,” said I, rising and bending over her, as she rose from","Great Expectations"
"the bench.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"“And will continue friends apart,” said Estella.","Great Expectations"
"","Great Expectations"
"I took her hand in mine, and we went out of the ruined place; and, as","Great Expectations"
"the morning mists had risen long ago when I first left the forge, so","Great Expectations"
"the evening mists were rising now, and in all the broad expanse of","Great Expectations"
"tranquil light they showed to me, I saw no shadow of another parting","Great Expectations"
"from her.","Great Expectations"
